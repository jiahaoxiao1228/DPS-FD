293282,0,"I bought the size I would typically in the glass, and they are seriously tight. I would have probably gone up a half size if I had been able to try them on. I think it is fixable with a shoe stretcher, and this is just a warning."
87711,1,"These are just awesome, lightweight and flexible with great support. Very comfortable, Nice looking too!"
378822,1,The shoes arrived earlier than expected. They were in perfect shape and were exactly as the description said they would be.
53166,1,"My sister in law only wear these shoes. I couldn't find them in a department store, so I decided to check Amazon. I was so elated when I found them and in her hard to find size. I thought that I wouldn't get them in time for Christmas, but they arrived just as promised. My sister in law LOVED them and I was extemely satisfied!"
240967,1,This shoe is so comfortable and got to be one of the best running and basketball shoe. Plus your getting official Iverson shoes!Great shoe!
258566,1,"I was debating whether I wanted to buy a pair online or just go into a store and buy them there. Boy am I glad I went to go buy them in person... as other people have mentioned, Converse run a little big so a size 11 (which I am) is really a 9 or so. I ended up getting an 8/5 and I haven't worn 8/5 size shoes since I was 13. You really want to go and buy them in person and completely avoid this problem."
137910,1,"Absolutely love these shoes. Not only are they stylish & cute (can be worn with more dressed up casual) but they are very comfortable for walking. On a warm weather vacation I brought these because I still wanted to look fashionable, but be comfortable for all the walking we were going to do. Even now, I wear them a lot. They're extremely easy & fast to get on & off. I've received many compliments. I will get many more styles of this type of shoe. Best dressy comfort shoe I've owned."
213017,1,I've ordered the black color last year and there were perfect.I also recently order the another pair brown color and noticed a little difference in quality. I was surprised when discovered that black one is made in BRAZIL but brown one is made in CHINA. Strange.......
95441,1,Arrived on time and were an excellent price for my favorite brand of sandals. No surpises and no disappointments a good deal.
301265,1,"I have trouble finding shoes that fit comfortably, and these are excellent because the woven leather straps ""give"" enough so that your forefoot is not pinched. It would be nice if they had a bit more arch support, but they are the most comfortable casual flats I have found. They go well with skirts, shorts or pants and hold up very well. This is my second pair."
97904,2,"I was very dissapointed with this product. I bought some beach crocs a few years ago and they were made in Canada. These were made in China. They are not the same quality at all. These are not cushioned like the others were, they are also smaller even tho they are the exact same size as the ones made in Canada. These are NO better than the cheaper ""knock offs"" you find in dollar stores."
125322,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
298320,1,"I received these shoes for Christmas and had to order another pair because they didn't fit. Sizes run big, I'm a size 13 and fit comfortably in a 12. My one gripe with this shoe is that you should wear mid-ankle or higher socks because lower styles tend to get bunched up. The only reason for 4 stars is that the sizes are big and it kept me from wearing these shoes a month ago! I will be buying more of Clark's brand."
166437,1,These shoes were well worth the money. They are very stylish and comfortable. I would recommend these shoes to any woman needing a break from stilettos like myself!!!
134325,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
150331,1,"My feet are important and the quality of shoes I get my feet on are important too that's why I choose Vaneli shoes, specially for the office, I wear them at least 9 hours a day that's why I have these particular style in many colors. They are so comfortable and look very nice, the leather is so soft, they feel like gloves, true to the size, just make sure you order the right width. Nothing like Vaneli shoes!"
226379,1,"I normally wear a size 10 in womens, but these are sort of big. I wish I saw the reviews before I bought them. I would have gone down a size. I definately suggest you go do that before you commit to a purchace with these shoes. They got here super fast, I was wearing them two days later!! Thank you so much."
317612,1,"I discovered this shoe while recovering from a foot injury and bought it for the ease of entry/exit and philosophy of the manufacturer. I have since bought a second pair and when not at work, wear nothing else winter or summer. Only draw back is the wear of the sole but have found a convient cobler who replaces the heel every other year. Definately a shoe worth every penny."
308955,1,"Worn these for two plus yrs. now. Sole is almost still new looking.Positives: The soles do not wear and are soft enough to protect your back, legs and feet when walking. Are waterproof and warm but not hot. Comfortable after broken in.Negatives: Scuff easily, hard to maintain. Shoe laces break after a short period of time. Could feel heavy to a person not used to weighty boots.July 2009-Still going strong. This is an exceptional boot Even though it looks like it has been through a war (or two)-comfort ++."
167837,1,These are the best flip flops ever! They are so comfy and stay put on my narrow feet. They can be dressed up or down.
71588,1,"Got it as a gift and I love it! The colors look vibrant and its the perfect size, feels sturdy. Altogether a great bag!"
98819,0,"This has been a decent winter running shoe with plenty of stability, fair amount of cushion, and decent traction. My primary gripe has been the insert not staying in place and riding back in the shoe."
180202,1,My son absolutely loved this shoes. They came in perfect condition. The best part was I did not have to hunt them down locally.
28618,1,"These shoes are really very comfortable. It takes a couple of wears for the shoe to shape according to your foot size, but after that it is perfect and goes well with almost anything."
43866,1,"Love these shoes! In nursing school, so I'm on my feet a lot. Takes a bit to break in but they are worth the $$!"
208436,1,"This is a great jazz shoe, looks great and stretches slightly. The size is exactly true to size. In the product description, it says ""runs large"", but that is not true."
287130,1,I bought my first pair of Rockport Prowalkers in 1993 and wore them 1-2 days/week since then. I cannot believe how long they've lasted and how comfortable they are. The new pair are great.
216406,2,"The reviews in various running magazines purport these shoes to be for the heavier runner. They are no such thing. Imagine strapping a couple of pine boards to the bottom of your feet and trying to run and you get a pretty good idea of how these shoes feel. They are extremely firm ( and I do mean extremely). Also, they have the least forefoot cushioning I have ever seen in a shoe including dress street and work shoes. Even though mine are fitted properly the bottoms tend to slap my forefoot as I run. Heavier runners beware!!! I am 250lbs and run fine in cushioned shoes. The Adidas Nova Cushions work great and are cheaper. They are, however, not as cool looking which is what probably sells these shoes. These, like so many other shoes today are designed to appeal to kids. Serious runners beware. My Ken Griffey Jr's make better running shoes since the cushioning in the bottom is much better while still being &quot;firm&quot;. They also weigh about the same and the stiffness is about the same. Forwarned is forarmed."
188651,1,"My mother-in-law has so much trouble finding comfortable shoes Between diabetes & problems that should be surgically corrected, but her high blood pressure prohibits surgery, finding shoes is like the proverbial needle in a hay stack search. Aetrex offered a full grain leather comfort shoe with velcro closures for easy adjustment. One look & I thought,""That's the shoe for Mom!""...and it was! She put them on, grabbed her cane, & wore them for her weekly shopping outing, & kept them on when we arrived back home. Amazing!!! Thanks, Amazon, for leading me in the right direction, & thanks to Aetrex, also, for solving the comfort dilemma!"
171304,1,"I saved $20 by buying these shoes online. They were $54 at a nearby store, I am very happy with them."
252393,1,"So comfortable, lightweight and convenient. Now I've graduated to Crocs Malindi. They're my ""dress"" Crocs. I highly recommend!!"
196376,1,"I'm so glad I brought these shoes for my father because he's been wanting a pair for so long, so I got them and he loves them. They're a great Shoe for a great price."
261266,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
203076,1,"These Keens are a very cool do everything kind of shoe. I actually purchased these shoes for myself after seeing that the men's versions only came in the same boring colors...navy blue, black, grey. Me being extremely secure with my sexuality I decided that I wanted the Process Blue(bright) and that I was willing to wear a womens size to get them. I have 4E wide feet...that is right not one E but 4, however I usually wear a 9 in mens shoes. Well after some trying I found the the womens' 11 fits me perfect. After going through all of this I recieved the shoes very quickly and found them to be a bit tight but after a short hike on the Appalachian Trail they settled right in nicely and have been very comfortable especially on the hikes where you have to cross a stream or river and your feet are doomed to get wet and stay that way. So far not a single blister from my neon blue womens' Keens on my big fat duck paddle of a foot.Great shoe with great quality."
334984,1,"These are them. Everyone wants them. They blew up this year and everyone is getting special colors, but the real deal are the gray suede."
282049,1,They are a little to wide but otherwise they are great. I get to spread my toes on demi-point. I just hope they do not get to loose. I would recommend it to others.
127195,1,"Very comfortable, relatively short time wearing them until they are comfortable.Good for work in rugged terrain and very good in hot weather too."
247083,0,"The shoes are very shiny, pretty much can be considered tux shoes. They are also quite stiff, makes your stride a little flat footed. Returned the product because I knew I wouldnt wear them to anything except for a prom or wedding."
16825,0,"Don't usually purchase shoes without trying them on first and I should have stuck with my rule. They are advertised as a Wide, but actually they didn't feel like it. The quality of the shoe is Wonderful and the shoe is really cute. I think it would be great for the average foot. I'm wondering since they put elastic in the shoe, that's what they considered ""wide"". Since I wore it once, I probably can't return it. If you have a regular width foot, I'd order this. Cute shoe!"
359908,0,"I normally wear an 8.5 (wide, if they have it) so I ordered these shoes a 1/2 size up (and wide) from other reviews suggestions. Welp...it still wasn't enough. These shoes definitely run small, and with hindsight I would have ordered a 9.5. Because it's too small, and because I'm too cheap to send them back, I will wear them anyway and just suffer a little bit from the pinching on the top side of my foot and toe box area. They are very cute though, and the heel is low enough to walk a moderate distance, but tall enough to add a little length to the legs. I took a risk by buying shoes I had never tried on before online, and it was almost a good idea."
284615,1,"I bought these boots for work (building maintenance) because I have diabetes and arthritis in my feet, and needed comfortable shoes that looked good. These fit the bill - I am very happy with the purchase. They are comfortable, the sole is soft, and they look good with minimal care. They are well padded on the sides and in the tongue. It remains to be seen how durable they are (I purchased them about six weeks ago), but from all indications they will hold up well. I wear a size 12.5, and these fit true. The multiple insoles are a good idea to help fractional sizing, and the arch support insole really helps my feet by the end of my shift.{update} It has now been over a year, and I have worn these boots every work day since I bought them. The fit is still as good as it was, and, with a shine, they continue to look great. They are a bit pricey, but the quality is well worth it in my opinion. Some of my co-workers buy $30.00 shoes from a big box store, and they have been through two or three pairs since I got these."
255507,1,"I have bought my first pair of Reebok Classic Nyon's back in 8th grade, this was the year 2001. I had bought a few more after that. Now they are the only show i will ever wear again.Thank You Very Much Reebok,Jeffrey M. Goldner JR"
21765,1,"These shoes fit true to size for me. I have this same style in several colors, and this is my 3rd pair of the chocolate color over several years. Highly recommended for comfort. Not a lot of padding in the sole, but the leather upper molds to the foot well. Great casual shoe."
51108,1,Bought these sandals for a cruise and they worked out perfectly. True to size. I really appreciate their arch support which made them easy to wear for hours without foot fatigue. I highly recommend this sandal for comfort and good looks.
140812,0,"I love the way these shoes feel and look. I wore them almost every day this summer. Unfortunately, they seem to only last one summer. The clasp broke just the other day as I was walking, and my shoe fell off. Luckily I was at home so I did not have to try to get home without a shoe. I thought these would be better quality - that's why I bought them. Am a little disappointed as these are my second pair of Dr. Scholl's that have broken. Don't think I will buy them again. Shoes should last more than one season."
257412,1,These shoes are awesome! they look great with everything. you will not be sorry you bought them.
173991,1,"The speedo Womens Surfwalker Pro Water Shoe was one of my best investments. The shoe is comfortable, quality of workmanship is well made. I purchased the color pink and black, just love my shoes. I also get compliments on them too. Thank you amazon for such good quality products."
66139,1,Good shoe for starting out players. Looks the same as the web picture.Easy to use cleat tightener and overall great shoe. Only downside is limited amount of color options (would have preferred white and blue).
335839,1,I found the crocs to be very comfortable and easy on my feet.they are a little wider than my other shoes but that seemed to help by giving the feet more room and not allowing any soreness. my feet would hurt after an hour's walk in my shoes but the crocs didn't bother me. I started to alternate my shoes and the crocs when walking so I hope to get good results. overall the crocs are very good to me.
73452,1,"I love my crocs. I have three pairs and wear them everywhere. They are very, very good for my feet. Other people have told me that they make their feet sweat, but for me they are perfect. The thick sole and the spring are wonderful. And ... if they get dirty, just wash them under the tap. Somebody asked me one time: ""Do you think I would look ridiculous if I wore those?"" and I answered: ""not anymore ridiculous than I look"" but really, I don't care. Comfort is everything. I have noticed that all the nurses and medical personnel in hospitals wear them, even doctors. They are on their feet all day long so that should mean something. As I said above: they are life savers."
347949,1,"I'm a Sperry Top-Sider fan. A great shoe for casual dress or boating activities. Quality, fit, comfort, looks....all there, pure and simple. A great product!"
296135,1,"I love my Yak Traxs!!!! They are the best thing!!! I have had a pair for years, they work so well on ice I recently bought a pair for my hubby and my brother."
31194,1,"True to size, great quality and my kids love them. These are great summer shoes- my kids wear them so much that they only last about 2-3 months. They grow so fast that the shoes last about the right amount of time."
189806,0,"Bought these for a white school uniform shoe. It is narrow at the ball of the foot, completely straight where your foot would be widest. Might want to consider a wide width or one size larger, even if you don't normally need wide. Seems to hold up well to wear. Leather in good condition."
34803,1,"I am a ED RN and haven't worked a shift without my Dansko's in 8 years. I normally wear a size 8 1/2 - 9 shoe and I wear a size 40 with Dansko clogs. I love them! For anyone new to Dansko's, give yourself at least 2 weeks of consistent wear before you determine if they are for you. I hated them at first, but was given same advice and am glad I followed it, as they are the best shoes I've ever had. I actually have one pair for work and another for home. Lastly, they are higher cost, but one pair will last you for years."
276371,1,"I have been buying Hi-Tec for years. When I found the Altitude IV I fell in love instantly. This shoe fits great, has little break in time and still holds its sturdiness as it ages. Well recomended."
198250,1,"The product is excellent, just send me the color is not requested, although in the case said White, the content was dirty unbleached white"
274313,1,"Delivery time was excellent. The comments others have made about the boot running narrow are correct. I ordered a wide but while the boot fits ok it does feel tight in the width. The first couple of times I wore it on short hikes it was comfortable, but on a 3 hour hike it rubbed off the skin on the side of my left heel. Also, the boots have a very stiff sole. However, walking in wet snow the boot remained perfectly dry. I'm new to hiking so perhaps this is normal, but the boot leaves something to be desired as far as foot comfort goes."
32399,0,"I have worn these for some time now and can only rate them as mediocre.The ankle support should be two padded ridges instead of just one. This would provide more ankle support.The insoles can just be removed and tossed, because you will want something that provides some real comfort. I chose Orthotics such as Dr. Scholls.The velcro closures could be made so that they can be pulled up tighter for a snug fit. The pieces fixed to the lower part are not long enough.Last, but not least, the tongue is just a single layer of what appears to be split cowhide leather. The designer should have taken an example from other manufacturers and heavily padded the tongue for more comfort and support.Not worth the cost is my opinion."
243107,1,"Couldn't find this particular color/design combo in stores, so was very happy to find it here at a great price!Converse shoes run a bit big, so make sure you order a good half to one size smaller than you would wear"
194105,0,"The shoe is incredible, however I ordered an 9.5 ameican measure and the shoe is too long for my foot, but I think the measure is wrong because of all shoes I have bought from amazon habe been 9.5 american and all they fitted like a glove, however this 9.5 shoe looks like it is a 10.5I just gave this product 3 star mark because the shoe looks incredible and its confortable in the right size"
265893,1,"I ordered my boots because they sounded great. I am not disappointed,they are great right out of the box.Fit well except the tongue is very short and could fit better around the ankle more. My order was delayed because of the snow but i am happy to finally be wearing them. Thank you very much for selling these fine and affordable boots. P.S I will spread the word to all the people i know who want happy feet. signed Mark Berglund"
261898,1,"When I first got them, they felt a little bit tight on my feet. I was disappointed and was going to return them, but then someone told me that after a few times they should become more comfortable. They were right!These are very comfortable shoes. And I wear them on daily basis. I have a child and we go to farms, dirt, parks etc. they have maintained their looks and are sturdy.I recommend."
233697,1,"i love these shoes, they are totally cute. the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper. they aren't as soft as i thought they would be, but i great buy none the less."
169053,1,"I purchased these shoes as a gift for my aunt in PA. She said it is the most comfortable shoe she has ever worn. I will purchase another pair for her closer to spring but told her the red ones are year-round too. Next, I will purchase a pair for me. Many thanks. NJ"
367401,1,This is a great shoe..... Very comfortable and well made..... Has a European look and great fit...... For the money you can't go wrong.....
227681,1,These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. The price was the best I've seen anywhere. I couldn't be happier.
227948,1,"Wonderful sneakers! They are comfortable and stylish. They run slightly large ( I wear a size 7 shoe, so I ordered a 7). They are very roomie, but comfortable and I can wear thick socks with them if I need to."
57731,0,These sneakers are OK....don't know if these are original or knock offs...fit is not the same as the Keds I remember!
122341,1,"For over 25 years I have relied on Softspots for casual wear. The shoes are durable and very comfortable. Great for travel and slip off going through airport security. The range of color choices (black, navy, brown, taupe) add a plus."
303604,1,I love these boots. I have been buying them over and over again over the past 10 years. And only buy this one. Strong sturdy well made. A bit heavy if you are not use to wearing boots. Once you get use to the weight great for construction work. The last pair I bought I did not even want to wear them for work they also look good for hanging out!
230169,1,Great price and delivery for Chuck Taylors. Very happy and so was my daughter!
18979,0,"They look great however whenever I walk more than a little, the toe beside my pinkie hurts and I get corns. P.S. they aren't too small for me so I don't know what went wrong. Not sure I would recommend them."
307308,1,This is my first pair of sandals from Keen. I have a wide foot and was skeptical I would get a good fit. They are the best sandals I have ever owned. Thank you Keen and Amazon.
46312,0,"I had ordered a black pair of this (along with 2 other pairs, different brands and models) using the amazon.com's shoe promotion (buy 80$, 20$ off). I am now returning the item. I had got the black pair. I don't know about the other pairs, but for this model in black I can say that the upper material is not leather as described. It is mostly (90%) fabric with small leather pieces where the straps come together. I was really disappointed since I was expecting shoes with leather upper. If you like fabric shoes, this might be for you, but be warned that the fabric is really stiff and my feeling is they would not extend. I regularly wear 7.5M in nine west, but since the upper material is fabric, the shoes would not extend, they are really tight in the front part. If you really want these shoes, I advice to order half size larger unless you have really narrow feet.Other than wrong description given here about the upper material, the shoes look overall above average and pretty. The sole is pretty stiff and would not bend. For some occasions these might be a good choice if you like fabric shoes, but otherwise it is not really for walking, or for long wearing. At least that was my first impression. Since i didn't wear these and am returning someone who actually owns a pair and is wearing may evaluate more accurately.Overall OK shoes. Would expect better from nine west though! That's why i gave 3 stars."
330815,0,COLOR WAS NOT WAS SHOWN. NO TIME TO RETURN THEM THOUGH WE HAD TO USE THEM
373237,1,This is the second pair of Carolina boots I have purchased in succession. I do not remember the model of last years pair but I paid about $30 more. I work in a metal fabrication shop and am pretty hard on boots. I expect and depend a pair of boots to last a full year as our company does provide a limited boot allowance. The sole on these boots wore as well as any pair I have owned. I have owned Caterpillar and Wolverine in the past. This pair (8510) took a few days to break in so I had to alternate with an old pair but once broken in I was very satisfied with the comfort. Eventually I put in some neoprene inserts to help with cushioning. I walk briskly and put on many miles in our large shop and I was happy with how the support held up. The only problem I had was the leather around the steel toe came apart earlier than last years pair and toward the end of the year I was concerned the toe would actually fall out. Keep in mine that working with steel and sheet metal is brutal on foot wear. I decided to move up a bit this year and just purchased the 1809 model and though early they broke in much easier. I intend to buy some Toe Guard or Gorilla Toe Guard to protect the toe. If it wasn't for the toe leather falling apart I would have given it five stars
189332,1,Thank you for resending the Crocs to the new address! They got here in less than a week.
102417,1,"I wanted something current and interesting. I have had knee replacement and needed a 2"" heel only. Not only was this shoe perfect it is amazingly comfortable. It looks great on too! Mission accomplished. Oh and not to forget the very affordable price!"
360087,0,"I purchased these shoes a half size larger than I normally wear and found them still very tight. Toe area is quite narrow. Otherwise, well made and good height for dancing."
33574,2,PLEASE I WANT YOU TO SEND THE ITEM BY POST BECAUSE IT IS VERY DEFFICULT TO GET THE YOU HAVE BOUGHT
59853,0,"I purchased a pair of altitude iv boots from amazon a week ago. I had a chance to wear and test them yesterday. I was very unsatisfied with the way that they preformed. The ""cleat like"" sole made it impossible to walk up a slightly inclined damp board. If I was able to return these shoes I would without hesitation, but instead I am stuck with a pair of boots that I feel are useless bordering on unsafe. These boots are one dimensional; they seem to work well if you only walk on soft earth or dirt. If you plan to wear these in to town... don't buy. They seem to be affordable, but found them cheaper at my local outdoor store.**Update**While I stand behind what I said above... These boots did turn out to be very comfortable. The footbed provides good arch support. They are very much a hiking/ snow clearing boot. Great if you don't intend to wear them to work. The rubber on a work boot like (timberland pro) is very different and allows the wearer to walk up a wet inclined board while these are better suited for a muddy inclined path."
128587,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
284326,1,"I really like these shoes and they are very good quality but I ordered the narrow size and find that they are still too wide. When I measure them against a pair of mediums, they seem the same."
322657,1,My daughter loves these shoes. We did buy a bigger size (1/2 size bigger)as some suggested but they are a bit too big for her. I would have bought her usual size - but she will grow into them. They seem sturdy and look very nice.
210360,1,"I bought this style (in the chololate brown) for a wedding. The first day I wore them for 16 hours! They are the most comfortable heels I have ever owned! I usually wear a 7, but the store clerk suggested I buy a 6.5 and put a gel insert to keep my foot in place. I now want to buy this shoe in every color!"
112628,1,"This great outdoor shoes, has a very price-quality relation. Are you loocking for a outdoor shoes ???. Look at that. Confortable and good price."
199169,1,"I couldn't believe that the shoe would be a full size too large so I went with a half size smaller, and was wrong. A full size smaller than normal is, if anything, still slightly large. But a fine shoe!"
10136,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
5113,1,I got these for my son's 14th birthday. He was so excited he threw them on on the spot. He has worn them about a month now and they are still his favorites.
382744,1,"Extremely comfortable, good tread, sturdy construction. These will last me for years. Oh, also have good arch support and cushioning around your ankle. I recommend them."
6760,1,Lots of copy cats out there but there's nothing like the real Sperries. We were really happy to find them so reasonably priced.
163821,0,"This seems to be a very nice shoe, but they run incredibly small! My daughter is normally a 12 1/2, so I ordered 1 13 1/2 and she could not even get her foot in it. You then have to pay a $5.00 re stock fee to exchange the size!I would not have been so annoyed with this, had the description said runs small! We are awaiting the new pair. The original came pretty quickly (about 4-5 days) I sent them back a week ago."
27685,0,I'm giving this shoe 3 stars for one reason. The width runs too narrow. I have had a similar sizing problem in the past and that was with Reebok. Otherwise it is a very attractive and comfortable shoe that looks like it it will last for a long time.
60395,1,"I walk back and forth to work, 6.5 mile roundtrip. I got these for walking in the snow and slush. I have put over 100 miles of roadside walking on these in all kinds of weather (rain, snow, & slush). Never a sore spot and my feet stay dry! I just love these!"
80080,1,"Never owned a pair of Tim's before. Took them out for an all day hike and WOW! Really resistant to water, comfortable, and are durable. look forward to owning these for a few years."
238963,1,"Someone should have said these boots run rather small. The boot is fine I love it but the size is small, I wear size 11W in other manufaactures products but to get a boot to fit I had to order and return twice before I got a pair to fit, (13M).JAMES K. BEAL Sr."
223073,1,"These are the best shoes I have ever worn in any sport. I play senior ""over 50"" slow pitch softball and the cushion in these are gentle on old knees. Several ladies on the team bought them and all rave about them."
205979,0,"I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
189428,1,"He has been wearing these boots every day for over 2 years now...whether he's landscaping, logging, snow shoveling. plumbing or working on a vehicle., it's a guarantee it will be done in his Carolina's...just yesterday he started rambling on again about how much he really loves them. Every once in awhile he gets out that flat gold can of black wax and replaces the laces and then holds 'em up to the light with pride,&#34; Look Hun, just like new again!&#34; In fact, while I am right here on this link, right now....I think I will secretly order him another pair to keep aside for him, as a back-up..... ;)"
360080,1,"they really fit good, are comfortable and nice and smooth for dancing.Glad that I made this purchase would do again"
261152,1,That's a product with a long tradition in market and I just was replacing my old sneakers. Coverse really rules.
191756,1,I now own five pairs!!! All in different colors! Hope they never stop selling them!
188138,1,"Trust AMAZON to enable me to find EXACTLY what I wanted at a great price! I just moved to New England from the southern U.S. and badly needed a good-looking, but PRACTICAL winter boot with excellent traction on the soles. I had been searching and nothing suited my perameters. Until my new BEARPAW boots. THEY HAVE IT ALL! COMFORT, LOOKS, WIDE GROOVES ON SOLES, AND SNUGLY WARMTH. In short, a great product at a very fair price!"
320083,0,"I have narrow feet. These shoes are so narrow that I have to get the next wider width. I ordered them in black which I loved, but had to return them and now they only have brown. It is an attractive shoe- I may just get the brown."
273297,1,"Love these - cute, comfortable and the sale price was fantastic. Super fast shipping also! Would recommend."
193233,1,"Fit is true to size. Was a bit leary ordering, arches are usually an issue. I am on my feet at least 10hrs a day and have no aches or pains related to wearing these shoes. Toe is just wide and round enough to be comfortable without looking odd or big."
214573,1,"I live in a wet climate, not a ton of snow, but these boots are great. Super warm and waterproof. Great for heading out to the mountains or for just going to the dog park. I think they do run a bit big....I wear a 9 and there is room for my foot to move a bit, however, not an issue when I wear thicker socks. I ordered the Buff, but received the black...however, I liked the black so much I decided to keep them."
310328,1,"My daughter loved the shoes. They are good quality and reasonable price. The vendor sent the shoes on time. My daughter says they are ""very cool"""
105453,1,We are very happy with these shoes. My daughter has been running Cross Country and Track for four years and has always bought this style. Many of her teammates wear them as well. They are a very good shoe for the price.
236662,1,I really like the Keds sneakers.. I ordered Navy and they look black. I would order again but in another color.
102048,1,"Received product in a timely manner. Grandson was so excited that he tried them on immediately.Fit was perfect,sole will be stiff until broken in. The red and black color really popped. Highly recommended."
132924,1,I recently purchased a pair of the Reebok DMX Walking shoes while on vacation in nothern California. I have a pair of New Balance 842 Walking shoes that I normally use but I left them at home. The Reebok DMX Max Walking shoes have been a pleasant surprise. They are comfortable and have the feeling of walking on air. They were also about half the price of my New Balance 842s. I did considerable walking while in northern California up and down hills and on flat land and my legs really never got tired. I now use them at home over my New Balance 842s. I normally walk 3 1/2 to 5 miles a day.
339259,1,these shoes were exactly what i was hoping for. they are my first pair of chucks and i must say i LOVE them!!! i want them in every color possible!=P super comfortable too...i could wear them forever!
152011,1,"Didn't have time to ""break"" my new shoes in before leaving for a trip to New York City. Didn't need to. I put them on for our flight (nice to be able to just slip them off to go through security) and wore them the entire time walking for miles each day seeing the sights of NYC. Very comfortable, true to size. Plan to buy another pair (in a different color). I got the black/silver ones - not much silver, they are a shiney black with black fabric. Highly recommend for anyone planning a trip where you will be doing lots of walking and want something a little dressier than athletic shoes."
123975,1,"I love these sandals and have ordered them over the internet for many years. They are basically my favorite shoe and I order them in many colors. I fear that they are being phased out, as they are getting hard for me to find now."
29967,1,"These boots are fabulous. I am a man and I'm size 11 US. They fit me perfectly, feel very comfortable, and look expensive. I am very pleased with the product."
106066,1,"I ordered this flip flop in white and they are so cute and comfortable, that I ordered another pair in black. They are so pretty with crystals on the straps ans so much cheaper that Havainanas. Buy them in you regular size and they fit perfectly."
317966,1,"I love these shoes because they are so quick to put on and easy to clean. My son enjoys wearing them, so they must be comfortable too. In addition, the navy ones I picked aren't some outlandish color, so they go well with many of his things. We're extremely happy with them!"
58273,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
165047,0,"I usually wear a 10AAA, but this shoe was too narrow for me. Maybe it would have stretched out, but I don't have the patience for that. So I had to return it."
6024,1,I love these shoes! They added to my new years eve outfit. I'm soo glad that I used amazon.com to find them. Took me a long time of looking to finally find these shoes and at a great price.
49164,1,"Not original but for the money good knock offs.. I just use them for walking of gravel roads but it is necessary to put in an insole.. then they are fine. They seem to last for about 250 miles, then the tip comes loose."
349034,1,"was a little worried about the sizing but the one i ordered fit just fine.this is a wonderful and sexy shoe, and very easy to walk in. the chunky heel is very forgiving and easy to balance in. with the platform being as thick as it is, it makes the shoe like walking in a 2 to 2 1/2 inch heel. great for beginners just learning to walk in heels,and perfect for extended wear. very easy on the feet. have worn this shoe for 9-10 hours at a time with very little effort. great buy for the money. would and will be ordering more of these in different colors."
240096,1,I order the water shoes and was very pleased with my purchase. It is excatly what I wanted and I got it in no time flat. I was a little hesitant about ordering on line but this experience was well worth it..
193767,1,"This is the third time I have purchased this shoe, it isso comfortable, my other shoes are jealous as they sit silently in the closet collecting dust. If you want a comfortable shoe, a good looking shoe, I recomment this one. And the price was right!"
213569,1,"I have 6 pair of the Scout, and have had more that I have worn out! They are the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn, and I am about to purchase another pair. I am 76 years old, and have problems with balance and my back, and have had foot surgery, and the Scout keeps me moving!"
91138,1,"Received the promptly ,they are made very well .This is my second pair and just love the way they fit ."
365260,1,"the shoes were awesome quality, shipped very quickly, but i guess that style runs big, i usually wear an 11, ordered that. they were huge, had to send them back."
105684,1,I ordered these shoes for my son who is a Crossfit Trainer. He wears a size 13 shoe so this is what I ordered. When the shoes arrived they were at least 2 sizes too large. My son said that they measured at least a size 14/15. I had to return them. So if you are ordered these remember that they run very large.
44250,0,"the only reason i gave it 3 stars is because it is not a flat. there is a drop in them. i usually only run in true flats with 0 drop. its ok for longer runs. my feet get way too hot in them though. i really didnt like them, but that is my opinion. i would compair them to the nike free 7.0 only with a much much firmer sole. i have only ran about 20 miles in them. cool color pattern though!"
293616,1,I have been running for 5 years now and increasing my mileage in the last year. I've tried similar Nike and New Balance running shoes in this price range and none of them has lasted as long nor been as comfortable. It is a cushion-y and stable shoe for someone with a neutral running stride (I can't speak for any other stride.) They have even been fine in the sub-freezing winters of the northeast.
327425,0,"I should have ordered this as a size 12 or 11 1/2 if available but I still likeed the shoe and still have them for around the house lounging around but not good for any strenuous sport because of snug because of size, not the shoe."
115025,0,"My daughter has average little girl feet. I think these run narrow. They are really cute & if your little girl has narrow feet-buy them. Otherwise, skip these ""ouchy"" shoes! Also, I think the elastic in the back was a little unforgiving on the backs of her heels."
3395,0,"I purchased these boots at a very good price, but I still have problems with hot spots when I hike. These boots are warm and they appear to be well-padded. They also offer very good support. However, after about 5 miles of hiking, I continue to have some hot spots. I have a slightly higher than normal in-step, so if I tighten the laces, I get a hot spot on the top of my foot. I have also had hot spots on the bone on the high side of my ankle. I always wear good hiking socks, but this doesn't seem to help. A neoprene ankle protector has helped the most, but this makes my foot feel constricted after four or five miles. If you're going to do serious hiking,either allow a significant time for breakin, with short walks to be sure you have addressed any problems, or consider a higher quality boot."
370260,1,"I have had these shoes about ten days. I have three other pairs of Ecco Shoes I have purchased over the last five years. They are great shoes however this is the first ""high end"" Ecco I have purchased. It is an awesome shoe. Comfortable out of the box it wears well with a suit or dress slacks. I am a trainer (seminars and workshops) so I stand for hours usually on concrete floors. These shoes have made it easier on my feet. I purchased this style as they were being discontinued so I paid less than the retail of $190. However if I had to I would pay the full price for the shoes. I really enjoy this shoe and the quality of the materials. The inner leather lining makes them cool in the hot summer of Houston. I have enjoyed Ecco Shoes for the last five years but this pair and style is the best pair yet! I would highly recommend them."
107897,1,This purchase was a replacement product and therefore a known entity. It is a good and useful summer sandal that meets a need. Ordering and shipping were on schedule and as described.
221050,1,"My son asked me for these shoes. He wears a size 14 and has difficulty finding his size shoes. Therefore, it is a pleasure to be able to find and order what he needs. He's been wearing Rockport shoes for many years because they are comfortable and durable."
283550,1,"Bought a pair of these a couple months ago. The styling isn't too bad, but they fit my foot so nice I have since bought 4 more new pairs to have later, before they get discontinued everywhere."
349931,1,"Comfortable, durable and true to size. Clarks is a great, reliable brand. Shoes will get water spots over time, so treat them accordingly."
205833,1,I love the Breeze Walker sandal. I gave it 4 stars because they changed their sole. At least that is my opinion. I am going to call the manufacturer to check. What I am referring to is that it seems to be a man-made composition instead of the way it used to be leather. As a result I feel like it is slippery if there is perspiration. Other than that it is a very comfortable walking shoe.
176744,1,"The only problem 5.11 has with these boots is that they are incredibly durable and have prevented me from buying another pair for two years. I work in law enforcement and I am very tough on boots. I have worn these boots every day for two years and there is not a single place on the boot where any defects can be seen or felt. The bottom still has plenty of tread whereas other boots I have worn for 6 months have lost all tread on the outside. They are quiet, comfortable, easy to run in, light, have kept my feet dry in downpours, and most of all--durable. I will continue to wear nothing but HRTs for as long as they are manufactured. Period."
210073,2,I was so excited to find these sandals then when I received them they were not the same quality that I had purchased 8 yrs ago. The leather was not that soft supple type that is comfortable it felt more like vinyl and they were too small. I sent them back and got a refund.
365952,1,We received the sneakers rapidly. They were just what we ordered and at a better price than I could find in the store.
13855,1,I bought these tennis shoes for my fiance and he just loves them! He's even talking about buying the exact pair
364266,0,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
114107,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. All of us girls have worn them for years, and they are so comfortable. The service was great, and delivered on time, the prices cannot be beat."
384108,1,I am in the process of buying myself a pair of puma &quot;Anjan&quot;.
158394,1,"Ordered these online. The first time they arrived we realized we had ordered them a size smaller than we needed. The return process was clear and simple - we mailed them back at no cost and were refunded the entire balance. We ordered the correct pair and received those in just a few days. They arrived in great condition, the right price, the right product, and in the right amount of time. No complaints, only praise for this vendor. Great job."
98473,1,I was very pleased with the selection and price discounts that were available only thru Amazon.com. I really shopped everywhere to find the best deal and selection and Amazon was it! My son says they are awesome!! Size 14's that he likes are hard to find! Thank you!
70353,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
336929,1,The Converse All-Star is a great looking shoe. The only problem is that they run big in size. Ex. If you wear a men's 10 1/2 you probably should order a 9 1/2 or 10. Otherwise you might feel like you're wearing clown shoes.
267554,0,"I purchased a pair of these in size 14 Wide. The boots I received were labeled as wide. They fit like mediums though. If you have a regular foot width, I am sure these boots are good because my wife owns a pair in regular width and she likes them."
381354,1,"Capezio Women's Jr. Footlight Character Shoe,Black,9 M US . The shoes were a Christmas gift and the recipient loves them. They are a comfortable fit and the heel is the right height for those mid-high heel lovers. The shoe is quality made and is as pictured."
213603,1,Tu buy an item from stride rite is always a garantee of an excelent product.
357473,0,I ordered two pair. One red and one blue. I love the red ones but the blue ones was not true to size. The blue ones seemed more narrow then the red ones. If you order blue you may want to try the wide in them.
354964,1,"Although the shoes were exactly what I wanted, I think the price is considerably high for canvas-topped shoes."
239489,1,I couldnt of been happier. I purchased these shoes 5 years ago and they have lasted me all this time. I wish that I could find another pair
382808,1,This is a shoe that you could wear with your business and formal wardrobe and yet walk around all day. It's extremely comfortable. You'll feel the cushioning effect all the time on your heal no matter how much you walk. I used to think that the patented air circulation is a joke. But it works! You'll fee the ventilation on the upper part of your foot.The shoe also looks very good with a shiny leather finish. In Summary an awesome formal shoe!As usual service by [...] was great. I got my shoe on the 3rd day after ordering via free shipping. Highly recommended!
230884,1,I couldnt of been happier. I purchased these shoes 5 years ago and they have lasted me all this time. I wish that I could find another pair
359906,1,They run small. We had to jump up an entire size to get a good fit. The are very comfortable now that we have found the right fit.
289066,1,"Evrything is good.Though I return because I can find a better deal nearly the same but different brand, I like this one.The size may vary compare to the other one with the same size I means I has tried this size 8 and felt a bit loose)."
20240,1,I purchased the shoes for work. They would have to be the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. The price was amazing compared to the same brand in stores in Australia.ThanksDavid
94861,1,Great shoes. Comfortable. Color goes great with outfits that are this color and shoes hard to find to match.
328500,1,"Lets be honest I needed a cheap pair of LARGE wrestling shoes fast to fight in for a army combatives tournament, these were $19.99... How could I go wrong? Well after having got them ONE DAY after I placed the order. And starterd to wear 'em... DAMN!!! I'd of paid the full price for them (whatever it was befor the huge mark down) Well worth it, the company that sent them was EASTBAY."
107869,1,This shoe is off da chain i bought this shoe when it came out. I gots the blue and white ones and they comfterable as hell they gots a spring in the sole so dat the wheel spins the only bad thing is that when you walk you hear the air from the spring but overall this shoe is off da hizzle.
256438,1,"Size was small for me, but my daughter loved them!! They are comfortable, fresh on feet and great price. Delivered right on time."
217252,1,My son loves these shoes! They are stylish and he says they are very comfortable. We've tried other brands of sneakers and he's just not as happy.
359532,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I own. The only draw back is the run a size larger than you normally are use to so you may want to go down a size. You can wear with anything anytime. If your looking for comfort and airy then these are for you! Great for people that are on their feet alot (or even a little) Great everyday shoe.Durable and easy to take care of.
369768,1,"love it!!!!!it's so light and comfortable....perfect for walking, shopping,,,,,,,and the price is great"
872,1,This is the only set of hiking boots I've ever had that doesn't sacrifice comfort for support or vice-versa. Maximum support + maximum comfort = excellent boot. Break-in time is minimal and once they do it's as if they've become part of your feet. Best boots I've ever worn.
330139,1,These boots are surprisingly high quality! Nice leather with good print. People cannot tell these from real lizard skin! Much more than I paid for.
240815,1,"I just received my tap shoes this morning, one day before the due date. I love the color and the taps look so shiny and thick. The shoe looks as if it's very well made and will last a long time, which is what I want. I used to tap when I was young but forgot a lot of it. I'm going to use these tap shoes to do Irish Step Dancing, like River Dance. I have a DVD that teaches you this dance and I can't wait to start.Would definitely order from this manufacturer again. I love that the shoe is leather too and not patent leather which may be a little stiff sometimes.Cathy"
20840,1,"Excellent shoes, very confortable and they look good. Exactly what you would expect from clarks. Would recomend them to anyone looking for a light and confortable everyday shoe."
144272,1,"I ordered these for my fourteen year old daughter for Christmas and the arrived very nicely packaged and in only three days with free shipping. She tried them on and absolutely loves them and begged to wear them but no dice, I wrapped them up for Christmas."
382005,1,"I received my shoes within two days. They are very lightweight, but beautiful. I didnt expect HIGH quality for 4.90, but I think they will last a bit. Very pretty tips. Super sparkly and girly. I wear a size 10 and got the Large ones. They fit ALMOST perfectly. I wish they had half-sizes though. I would order from them again. I got a great deal here."
184693,0,"I've tried a bunch of sandals. NONE are as comfortable as these. I wear them all day long. Even to large theme parks like Disneyland. They cradle the foot and are so comfy. Great shoe. You will buy many pairs of them, guaranteed."
102826,1,"Well symple a well made capezio, looking great, very comfortable,great red color, They have double red and black braid. I recommend it"
44370,1,"I just bought my third pair of these boots in five years. I found them to be almost indestructible for light machine shop and daily use on the street. They are VERY COMFORTABLE, ideal if one is on your feet all day.They also polish up well and are presentable WORN as a dress boot/shoe.They felt like a favorite, comfortable old pair of shoes from the first time I put them on...SORT OF INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BUNNY SLIPPERS!The boots are very well made from real leather.They are not heavy duty enough for heavy construction,logging or concrete work. Good for light farm work and driving.THEY ARE THE BEST WEARING WORK BOOT, I HAVE FOUND FOR DAY TO DAY WEAR.The soles have some tread, giving you fair traction in the grass, snow and ice plus have excellent wear resistance.Also...the boot's sole patterns does not leave large clumps of the outside on the kitchen floor, while stepping into the house.The boot sizing is pretty much exact. Only buy your exact sizeExcept a WIDER SHOE if you plan to wear multiple pairs of thick socks in the winter.They have an excellent size / width selection. I usually need a 14 EEEEE in a boot.The boots are almost waterproof, you will need to apply a reasonable coat of waterproofing silicone spray or mystery oil leather treatment. KIWI SHOE POLISH makes them shine up very well.The leather uppers are well cut out pattern and sewn together with care.I never had problems with the leather, material, sewn seams splitting or tearing, and no loosening or unusual wear with the heels or soles.The leather is thick enough to protect but still thin enough to be flexible.I have bought both he 6 inch and 8 inch versions of this farm boot.Both boot heights are just as easy to get on and off, however the eight inch high boot does gives you a bit more ankle support.So, I prefer the eight inch height.The only thing I can recommend extra for these boots...Order a bit thicker,round nylon boot laces, instead of the flat, cotton shoe laces that come FACTORY standard with these boots.If you need soles with more traction get something with a VIBRAM sole.However, trust me, your wife will remind you,often, to remove your boots before coming into the house with VIBRAM soles on.The only tougher and better boots I have seen and bought,have been just as happy with, are the White's Smoke Jumper Logging Boots and they COST ALMOST $500.00The FARM BOOTS are a great deal! I wish more American companies made things with this amount of care /pride in the product,a good design philosophy, used quality materials and all put together with wonderful workmanship!The people at WORK AMERICA remind me and hearken back to an earlier time in this country, when something that was stamped AMERICAN MADE or MADE IN USA meant often this product was the best made in the world!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D94HNQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
205698,1,"Very happy w/the product, shipped right away, fits true to size."
25611,1,"I have been using Kiwi shoe polish for many years and have never been disappointed in it. It applies easily and evenly and without too much effort can be brushed into an excellent shine. It's thick enough to nicely fill in little nicks in your shoe leather. The third-party seller delivered it to me promptly, although this observation may not be of too much value to you because you may be buying from a different seller."
350441,1,Very comfortable. I'm on my feet 10 hrs. a day on concreet floors and these are the best I ever found.
30396,1,Super fast delivery. Thank you. I will be wearing these boots with a 70's style dress. They are beautiful and I cant wait to wear them. I have aways had big calves and they fit perfect. They seem well made with nice material. I love these boots!
131760,1,"Brought these shoes couple months ago & have been happy with them. I generally am US sz11 or AU sz10 but found these are running a little bigger so when I purchase my next pair of these will be getting US sz10.5 instead of 11. I find them very comfortable for working long shifts & they are wearing well so far, but am thinking of adding a little more arch support but they are ok without added extra's.Update: I've had these shoes for near 12 months & they are great. I want to order more but amazon dont have them only other shoe sellers do that dont do shipping to Australia.Plz Amazon get these shoes back to being able to be shipped to Australia as I need another 2 pairs.These shoes fit my insoles for Plantis nicely & am finding that these shoes are the only ones I can wear atm because of hip ligament injury"
376344,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
149345,0,"I bought a pair of these last year, and tore up the top of my foot. I chalked it up to trying to wear these at the beach. Dog ate them so I bought another pair. Only mild indoor walking at the hotel and 1 trip to the store. Soles of my feet were killing me."
191767,1,This is the only sandal I can wear without hurting my feet. I can wear these sandals right out of the box on an all day shopping spree and my feet are fine! I wear a D width and these are truly the best fit for wide width feet. I have them in every color!
380807,1,"My two daughters needed character shoes for a performing arts tour. Rather than go to a dance studio or supply shop, I ordered 5 pairs of these for my daughters to try on. I ordered in different sizes/widths close to the needed sizes. They ran within a half size of true size for us, and we were able to find two pairs that worked within the 5 pairs I ordered. They have a good selection of the larger, harder to find size ranges and the wider widths.This is a decent, suitable, affordable basic shoe and seems to be a good value for the price range. Ordering from Amazon and taking advantage of the free return policy for the unwanted shoes saved me a 70 mile round trip to the store, and a considerable amount of money that I would have spent at a retail establishment."
159250,1,I am in my upper 40's and shoe comfort is a must. I paired my Chucks with a pair of Sof Sole insoles and they are soooo comfy. I have not tried to run in them or walk a marathon. Not sure I want to take that risk. I boughy my insoles from Sports Authority for $15. They are the gel ones that are super thin.
32132,1,"No Complaints. Everything ran smoothly. I recommend this seller and this product to everyone. They are absolutely great, and they were exactly as described/pictured."
321364,1,"It's a great ballet shoe, nice leather and sole piece--seem well made. Unfortunately I thought street shoe size would work for this also. It didn't. I had to send it back and get another size up. You might want to get a size larger too..but great for the price!"
87664,1,"These shoes are comfortable, and the price was right. They run a little smaller per size than the Aetrex Rhino Runner which I reviewed earlier, and are not quite as comfortable to me, but I would buy another pair when these are worn out. Nice to have a black shoe for comfort wear sometimes, instead of wearing the more flashy Rhino Runner. They seem to be holding up well."

355150,1,i had a converse b4 but it was getting really old so i decided to buy a new one. it was just as i wanted it to be. its sure NOT to disappoint.
118233,0,"True to size but really wide, other wise good quality. Also nice pink color. I don't recommend them unless your are in need of some width."
241696,1,"These shoes are very comfortable and very cute! They are very versatile- good for work, going out, or just for casual occasions. I would not recommend going on long walks in them though."
295081,1,"Great traction. Makes you confident while walking on ice. As soon as I wasn't wearing them, I fell and bruised my hip. Do not wear indoors(floor scratches), and have a drip tray for them beside the door because inevitably if your using these in the conditions that their built for then your going to be bringing in dirty ice particles with you. I don't use them all the time in winter, but when it's icy, they've paid themselves off 10 fold. Great gear for emergency workers when the conditions call."
106647,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
303187,1,"I selected this brand specifically because I had another pair and loved them, but I put a LOT of miles on them and so wanted a spare. Although this was not the exact same style, it was equally as comfortable, study and stylish. I love this brand for a nice looking shoe for work that is very comfortable to walk in!"
319328,1,These shoes last for SO long and fit great. The color is perfect and they are wonderful to dance in.
289800,1,"The sandals are exactly what I need. Comfortable and good style for daily wear, excellent quality for tough environment/activities, easy to adjust. You can even simply step in as a slipper. Perfect summer sandals."
45677,1,"I love these shoes! They are so comfortable, I end up wearing them all the time. They are great for days at the gym when I'm doing weight days ( so I don't have to wear my running shoes). I love walking around town in these shoes. My other shoes always made my feet hurt after a while. I've been complemented so many times on these shoes. I will probably buy my brother a pair of these for Christmas.The only issue I have, which is slight, is that the bottom sole seems to be made out of a flimsy plastics. Other than that the fabric of the shoe is very high quality, and the toe has a nice suede."
241486,1,"I got a pair of converse shoes for Christmas almost 3 years ago, and I have been wearing these shoes almost ever since. They feel comfortable, they look good, and they have hardly any wear on them after 3 years. As a matter of fact, I have them on right now as i am writing this review..I'm thinking about buying another pair in a different color just because i love them so much."
24359,1,"Wonderful experience all the way through. The shoes are soooo comfortable and are dressy enough to wear with summer pants and shorts. As always, dealing with Amazon is the best: never any problem they can't solve. Have ordered these shoes in another color b/c I loved my first pair so much."
145913,0,"I'm a nurse in a busy facility. I rarely have the luxury of sitting down during my shift. I am always walking and standing. I really don't have foot problems but saw this ad and thought I'd buy a pair to see how they feel. First - the sizing is a bit odd. I wear a standard size 8 - medium width, and I guess I was too quick to order the 8M- which turns out to be US size 8D. These shoes are a bit snug around the toe area, and my feet are not wide at all. The heel also comes up a bit high on my ankle, which is a bit uncomfortable.They are sturdy shoes and I expect them to last a long, long time. Compared to the nurse shoes I usually wear, these shoes are pretty hard. I'm not 100% sure I'd order them again."
290228,0,"I ordered these boots because they say they are 12"" but they are really 10"". They are also made from thin leather."
173451,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
212729,1,6 N is a hard to find shoe size. This white sandal was perfect in every way. It's exactly what I was looking for !!
41232,0,"I normally love Reef sandals but these are different than sandals I have bought from them in the past few years. I held these up to last year's sandals and the same size has about a half inch trimmed off all the way around. Sure, my foot still fits on the shoe but just barely. I should have returned them but I was hoping I could make them work. I don't think I will ever wear them in public because it looks like I can't afford to buy shoes that fit. I'm really disappointed with this change in their sandals."
127527,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
380718,1,"comfortable shoe for a great price. I read the reviews and ordered a half size bigger, in wide instead of regular. It fits perfectly!"
16135,1,"These were for my brother who requires sturdy and supportive sneakers with velcro closures for daily use. The extra wide width was a bonus, and they're very comfortable for him. They also arrived within very quickly. We're very satisfied."
341627,1,These are the most comfortable shoes to wear all year round. I love the convenience of just sliding them on and off without having to untie the laces. They look good with just about everything. I would definately buy these again.
377548,1,"Before I explain my rating, let's get the &#34;Size&#34; issue out of the way. There is a sizing guide on the order screen; it explains that you merely have to place your foot on a ruler and then check the measurement (heel to toe) on the guide to get the right slipper size. It is not the same as your shoe size.My Tamarac Slippers fit me perfectly; they do not pinch or fall off my feet. Previously I used moccasins purchased at a well known discount store. I often go outdoors in the evening for a number of reasons; the moccasins have fairly thin soles so I could feel every pebble of twig that I stepped on. The Tamaracs have a more substantial sole and are actually durable enough to use outdoors. While not as thick-soled as my workboots, they are firm enough that I do not have to walk around like a cat on broken glass.I look forward to the end of my day when I can kick off my boots and slip my feet into my Tamaracs. They look so good and are so comfortable that I intend to wear them when going into town for errands. Should I worry about what people will think when they see I am wearing slippers? Well, who cares what a fat, bearded old man is wearing anyhow - let them think I am eccentric. At least my feet will love me because they will be comfortable.R-von"
322958,1,"I chose four stars because I like the shoes, but I'm not yet sure if the leather would stand up to rigorous wear because it seems quite thin and a bit dry. I might put some leather conditioner on and see how that goes.The shape is good, and the fitting guide is VERY helpful. I'm very pleased with the fit of the three pairs I bought recently for my kids and I.I'd definitely recommend them for beginners."
149124,1,"My son absolutely loves these shoes. He spends a lot of time creating art on them w/Sharpies, it's great they wear so well. Because they are a tennis shoe, they're supportive w/ plenty of cushioning in in the soles. Thumbs up for these classic gems! BTW, fit runs true to size."
347607,1,estoy feliz con la compra pues no conseguia numero grande en chile para mi esposo. ademas la entrega fue rapida
150904,0,"These shoes were ok looking. The buckle is golden, and the material is not the best. The leather is very flat/dull looking, and it is hard. This brand tends to be all over the place when it comes to sizes. I own the Rosa heels in Medium width, and they are slightly wide, and I have wide feet for my shoe size. So I was expecting these to fit, but the front of the shoe is quite narrow, so my toes were squeezing in them when I tried them on. As the material felt hard, I thought it would take several sessions of pain to break them in, so I returned them. If you have wide feet, order a half size or one size above your street size, or order the wide widht ones. They are not pretty anyway with the leather being so dull looking."
221920,1,My boyfriend absolutely loves them ! So warm and comfy and you can run to curb in your slippers..He's thanked me three times for them !
354002,0,The boot is comfortable and keeps its good looks. However what appear to be a 1 1/2 inch thick heel is actually only the thickness of the tread. If you wear down the back of the heel on one side (which most people do) cardboard or something starts to show through. That chunky heel you see is basically 1/4 inch thin.
345222,1,"These shoes are true to size, are authentic converse, are comfortable, and arrived on time and in the correct color. My only complaint about converse is that they are a bit too narrow. However you can find them at pretty much any shoe store so you can always try them on first before you buy them. I am happy about the price too (they were $10 more expensive at DSW than here on amazon). They don't offer much in terms of arch support, but overall I can't complain."
176011,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
224074,1,"Couldn't find the right size at the store so looked for it at Amazon, then found it and purchased here. Everything was perfect. My daughter loved this shoes, and delivery was done as expected."
100885,1,"I read a lot of reviews and checked the Capezio website before ordering, and (sure enough) this shoe seems to be sized about like normal street shoes. My daughter wears 11 or 11.5 and the pair I ordered (size 12) was a little big (as I hoped). Quality seems good enough to hold up to weekly lessons for a lot longer than they will fit!"
294890,1,"These socks are for shoe size 12.5-5. My son is a size 5. I bought these for him for soccer. I think they will fit for another year, even if his foot grows. Currently, they fit over his shin guards and fold over below the knee about 2.5"". If he grows, the fold will be smaller, but that's OK. I love how these came in a huge variety of colors, so I could get the color that matches the league jerseys. My son said, ""They're fuzzy. I like that,"" when he put them on for the first time. I don't think they're fuzzier than other athletic socks, so I'm not sure what he meant. But, he's happy, so I'm happy. These are a great price for 3 pairs!"
137789,1,I got these for running around cleaning my house and running errands (my new lace up shoes for anyone follows flylady :P) . They fit well and are very comfortable. I also really like the red color :)
326862,1,"I recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended ASICS shoes to me. This is my first pair of running shoes and I am very pleased with it. The shoes were very comfortable from the day one.One comment that I have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front. I have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe. I worked out fine for me, however, because I had purchased 1/2 size longer than what I usually wear.Overall, I am very happy with this pair and would recommend it."
332760,1,"The Crocs are excellent, great size, and perfect. Shipped in timely manner. I would recommend buying from this seller. Top notch."
257502,1,"I purchased black Life-Stride Malibu sandals during the summer. They are comfortable and I love to wear them all the time. They look nice with shorts, jeans or dresses. The temperature is often warm here so I wear them often."
128839,1,"the shoes are gorgeous, great red color, great design, great quality, but yes unfortunatly a bit uncomfortable...might bring them to get stretched out; or i heard taken a walk in the rain, then sitting back someplace (not to warm) and letting then dry on your feet works. The 7.5 is a little snug but i feel once their broken in they'll fit perfect. I'd totally buy again though, the leathers beautiful and they have great yellow ones too!"
126975,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
70846,1,I have two pairs of these and they are awesome! They form perfectly to your foot. They have wide straps which is nice and come in many colors. They have just the right amount of cushioning. I do alot of walking in them and my feet don't hurt after. These are my favorites sandals ever!
258526,1,"I really like these shoes. I use them for weightlifting/running. My only warning is that they run quite big. I had to order 1.5 sizes smaller than I usually do, but they work fine. My first pair got torn up a lot around the lace-holes, but I think that was because they were too big. My current pair has no problems so far."
59301,1,"These boots not just look good but are very comfortable, this is my third pair .......I would recommend these to any one who is looking for a low price hiking boot"
186749,1,"BEING A LANDSCAPER I HAVE HAD SEVERAL YEARS OF FOOT PAIN BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF WALKING I DO. I PURCHASED THE LACROSSE BOOTS BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS I HAVE SEEN ESPECIALLY FROM OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE ON THE FEET ALL DAY. I PREVIOUSLY WORE TIMBERLAND ONLY TO HELP WITH THE FOOT PAIN BUT THE LACROSSE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE AND BETTER BUILT. MY PREVIOUS PAIR OF TIMBERLAND HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE SOLE SEPARATING FROM THE BOOT. TIMBERLAND DID REPLACE THE BOOTS BUT THIS APPEARS TO STILL BE A PROBLEM FOR THEM. I AM NOT KNOCKING TIMBERLAND, BOTH BOOTS WERE MADE IN CHINA BUT IT APPEARS LACROSSE HAS BETTER QUALITY CONTROL. MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT AGAINST TIMBERLAND IS THAT IF I SPEND $120.00 FOR A PAIR OF WORK BOOTS WHY CAN'T THEY PROVIDE YOU WITH A PAIR OF LACES THAT FIT THE BOOT. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT A SMALL ITEM LIKE THIS IS NOT PICKED UP BY QUALITY CONTROL. I HAD TO BUY 4 EXTRA PAIR OF LACES TO FIND ONES THAT FIT TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL ONES THAT ARE TOO SHORT AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS COMPLAINT. THE LACROSSE ARE MUCH EASIER TO LACE UP WHEN PUTTING ON AND IF YOU BUY THE ONES IN THE COLOR I DID THEY REALLY ARE A GOOD LOOKING BOOT WITH GREATER ARCH SUPPORT."
166275,1,my step sister's daughter had some on which she wears them all the time age 11 she loves hers and then my son wanted some he got his for christmas and now we see everyone has them..kids out in our street rolling down the street them on..now my youngest son 4 wants some..he wants to wear them all the time and i have to say no dont wear them today but he wears them to the restuants and any where i will let him...they are cool..it dont take long to learn how to use them.it took my son about a week to get the hang of it..
353263,1,"Other boots I've had fit fine at first, then, after stretching out they just feel sloppy on my feet. While the Guide Gear boots are tight at first, after stretching out they fit like gloves from that point on. That's how they should be. The soul is rugged enough to walk around outside. I've even shoveled snow wearing these boots. I've had my first pair for years and I'm buying my second pair today."
350779,1,I bought the shoes for my son. He really likes them. They fit great & he says they are very comfortable.
107623,0,"Careful if you have wide calves and order this. The product description is for the Denzel Plus boot, with wide calves. However, when I ordered from this page (from ShoeMall, through Amazon) they sent the regular Denzels, which are at least 2 inches smaller around the calf, so I can't wear them. From what I could see they would look great if I could zip them up! They aren't real leather, so keep that in mind. I didn't mind that since the price was low. But now I have to return them and find another pair that will really fit."
80998,1,"This sandal is supportive, simple, comfortable (doesn't rub or blister). So far, so good. I think they will be worth the ~$20."
57928,1,These are classic black gym shoes. We needed plain black gym shoes for the school play. These shoes were perfect.
227243,1,This shoe is exactly what my son wanted. The quality much better than cheaper versions. This is the real converse shoe
60745,1,"Soy gu&iacute;a de turismo en Costa Rica, mi trabajo exige largas caminatas en bosque, ciudad, playas, senderos, etc. Por tener tantos meses de lluvia siempre he usado botas hi-tec impermeables y no tengo queja alguna, los &uacute;ltimos 2 pares los he tenido que cambiar porque se me gasta la suela! C&oacute;modas, ajuste perfecto, livianas, muy resistentes, y con un precio accesible!El env&iacute;o fue mejor de lo esperado.Pura vida!"
43893,1,"I loved these shoes and was so sad that I had to return these. I loved the shoe, but the right shoe was noticeably larger than the left - same size. I never have this issue with other shoes. I ended up returning and getting a different color in oiled leather & they fit fine.Only taking one start off because the sizing should be consistent."
17276,1,"This was an expensive present for my husband. It was definitely a splurge because these sandals are the most expensive footwear he owns. From the moment he opened the box, they haven't left his feet. He wears them everywhere. Not being a sandals kind of guy, he is now a convert and so grateful I bought them that he's being extra helpful around the house.Advisory: If you're a true size 8, I would consider ordering a size down because they run big. My husband is an 8 1/2 and they're a bit large."
311118,1,"I already have a pair of Keen Venice H2 sandals and loved them, so I just bought a second pair in a different color. I've found the H2's to have wider toes which are more comfortable for my feet. Not all the Keen's fit the same. As other reviewers have said, order a 1/2 size bigger. I typically wear 8's or 8.5, so I went with the 8.5 here and it's perfect."
303818,1,"While I'm not a runner, I bought these on advice from others that have to walk on concrete as part of their job. The anti roll and cushion soles are the best support I've had for my feet in a long time. I ended up buying a second pair, one set for work, and the other for home and biking.You can't go wrong with this shoe, not to mention you can get them in 4E widths!maloy"
29508,1,I purchased these sneakers for my daughter who is a school teacher and stands on her feet all day long. She swears by them. This is the newest of the skecher line in slipon's and she loves them. They came quite quickly and fit her snuggly but they will stretch with time. They tend to run tight to size. The wide width is great.
14226,1,"Very nice shoe it would be great if this style came in more colors. Shoes are comfortable and sturdy, great for walking."
202545,1,"My teenage son loves these shoes. This is his second pair and he wears them often. The Sperry Billfish costs a bit more then other Sperrys, but he prefers the style and fit of these."
242028,1,"I love these shoes. They are just what I was looking for. The length is perfect and accurate for my regular size, but the toe is narrow (not pointed, but narrow). So, unfortunately I am returning them because i can't figure out if I should get the next size (that would make them too big in the heal and length) or get them in a wide (which would make them too wide in the heal). What to do??!? So, unfortunately they're going back."
79523,1,These are classic Converse shoes. They arrived quickly. The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform.
283950,0,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
293,1,"I had initially purchased a pair of Asolo Moran GTX. Although they were great boots, wearing those around the house made me realize that the right boot pinched a bit too much for my liking. Those got returned and in desperation picked up a pair of these. For the price (roughly 1/3 of the Asolo) these are fantastic boots.Break-in was fairly quick with my biggest problem area being around the shin. A strategic fold of the smartwool socks intially took care of any discomfort for the test hikes around the neighborhood. I have had no issues with the boots since then. I have deliberately stepped into streams to test the ""waterproofness"" noting no problems. The traction seemed fine.Great boots and will most likely purchase them again."
309362,1,These are one of the most comfortable dress shoes I have ever worn. I normally wear tennis shoes being a nurse and so I know what is comfortable. I bought these softspots after buying two pairs of shoes that were just so uncomfortable and produced blisters. Now I am not going to dread wearing dress shoes and now make them my go to shoes.SoftSpots Women's Stephanie Pumps
259662,1,Outstanding shoes! Just like I remembered from high school years ago. I was glad to see them make a comeback and the price is great too.
268039,0,"I have purchased 2 pair of dansko professional shoes in the past 6 months. They fit differently and the piping on 1 pair is coming off- so I carry a Sharpie marker to hide the defect. For the price, these should wear better!"
41851,1,"This shoe has no ""break in"" period. This has to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have every worn straight from the box. I hope they hold up, seems to."
39841,1,this is my second pair of Reef Ginger flip flops. The first pair lasted two summers with almost daily wear. They're squishy and super comfortable and have a little arch support that justifies them being a little more expensive.
324538,1,"just in time and just what i needed. This are just like the first reebok shoes i got as a little kid. Light, confortable. They also fit just perfect. Strongly recomend this product."
110077,1,"I bought these sandals for my mom because they looked nice and were from Softspots a company I love. She hasn't worn them out yet but reportrd them to be very comfortable. Just what we were looking for. Excellent product as usual. I highly recommend,"
261028,1,"These are my 4th pair of chucks and I love them. I know exactly what I'm getting and I don't have to try them on. I normally wear a 8.5 in womens, but I order a 6 in mens when I buy chucks. It took almost a week from when I placed my order to receive the shipping notice, but the shoes arrived 2 days after I got the email. Just wish they got here sooner!"
355638,1,"I bought these for my husband, he liked them, but they run a size bigger, after exchangeing them for a size smaller he was happy with them."
112784,1,"My mom actually bought these shoes for my daughter. She found them while browsing children's shoes online. They're cute online, but they are even cuter in person. They fit my daughter well and just look so comfortable. The brown goes with most of her outfits and the cutouts give it such a sweet, delicate look. She was wearing them when she first learned to walk at almost 11 months old and these easily gave her the support she needed. I get comments from people all of the time when she has them on about how precious they are. People are always asking me where they can buy a pair. I love these shoes!!!!"
245429,1,"It's hard to find a white tennis shoe that doesn't just look plain stupid these days. I hate the huge basketball puffy shoes and the super white polo club/preppy versions. So when I saw this shoe I had to have it. It is the right combo of both retro styling and unassuming 'I don't care' fashion. The shoes are really comfortable, durable as heck and just keep getting better looking the more they are broken in. I'm going to buy another pair because after 1 year of abuse I know I'm going to need a backup when they eventually disintegrate.I recommend the white with Navy myself. The white with black are a little too 'Run DMC'...though they wore Adidas....I know."
227386,1,"As the title says, I believe this is an essential purchase for any man. They're comfortable, light, and good looking. The flat sole is great for extended walking and sports (specially weight lifting in my case). I like how they look and make my feet look slim as well. Heheh. Combined with my other clothing, I like how they help make everything seem that much ""tighter"". These are just a must have :)"
219060,1,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt. A lot! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. but other than that they really have nice ankle protection, by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them. i would and did recommend them to everyone. so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent!"
293892,1,"These shoes are even cuter in person and they make my son look so grown up. He was just growing out of a 9 when I bought these in a 10. Should have bought the 9.5, but he's wearing them anyway. Good quality and the stitching detail is very attractive."
224519,1,"Normal chucks...awesome as always. I've worn them for the past 2 years. They're looking a little worn now, time to buy another pair. :)"
126591,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
332422,1,"I usually don't order shoes online but I don't like shopping for a wide shoe, I want to buy a wide shoe. I have bought Dockers before and Rockports with good results.Rockports are not as good as before, so I found these nicely styled Dockers in a size 10 2E and they fit great and are so comfortable."
126746,0,"I love Eastland shoes and I love this style. The thing is, I only had these shoes for about two weeks when the soles split on both shoes at the same location....right at the ball of my foot. Rather than going through the hassle of returning the shoes, I continue to wear them periodically and they are still together. Other than the disappointment of the soles splitting, they are great shoes. If they had not held together the rating would have been a 1."
321291,2,"fits too tight in the toe, and flared out in the middle. returned them for a refund. Not what I expected at all.."
364196,1,"Love the shoe .. comfy and cool .. but .. no so happy with the color .. if I bought again, I'd chose a different color .. but to each their own I guess"
17485,1,"Unlike almost every person who reads this review or buys this style of Reebok, I am limited in my choices. Because of childhood polio, my feet are extremely small (4.5-5)and I wear braces on both feet. The Reebok Classic is the only shoe we have been able to find that has a solid bottom or sole. This allows my shoe repairman to add an inch lift to the bottom and a wedge. I am very fortunate that the times we live in are such that the sight of someone in the grocery store in ""sneakers"" is an unremarkable event. It also helps that I live in So. Calif. where casual dress is the standard. I am not really as pathetic as I sound, I actually own 3 pairs of the Classic Nylon Reebok, 1 pair of black leather extra depth shoes and a pair of light tan extra depth. That's it!! I consider Sarah Jessica Parker to be a goddess."
78420,1,Shoes are Great! When you buy make your order for a smaller size. I ordered size 11 and they are plenty long enough. You should order at least 1/2 size smaller. Overall shoes are just like you'd expect from Converse.
275791,1,"This is my second pair, the first are wearing like iron and I wanted to make sure I could replace them."
329957,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
229854,1,"The shoes that I ordered fit great. I have yet to play indoor (or any) soccer in them but I'd imagine they work great because they are reminiscent of martial arts shoes, which is what I use them for. There is one thing, these shoes are pretty squeaky once you break them in so don't expect to be a ninja wearing them."
209806,0,"They were narrow, like European Shoes. Buy a wider width and a half-size larger. If you have a high instep, do not buy these. They are well made but not for me. I had no trouble returning them. The vendor was fine."
321663,1,"You can't bet Minnetonka shoes for comfort... the company has been well known forever for this! Also, this color (sort of a muted blue/gray) goes so well with jeans, too!"
7159,2,"I do not find these walking boots to be comfortable, as advertised. They look good, but they hurt my feet. I would like to return them, but I have worn them four or five times, thinking I would ""break them in"" and they would become comfortable. Hasn't worked so far."
389528,1,"Exactly as was expected, good very durable shoes. Very clean and wearable. Would definitely purchase again, nice to wear out."
340972,1,"I got these shoes just in time for the trip to Universal Studio. They were very comfortable and was a perfect fit. I love them and would order another pair at a heartbeat. The price is great ($29.89) even with the extra delivery charge, it's well worthed."
109866,1,"Received the promptly ,they are made very well .This is my second pair and just love the way they fit ."
173536,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
189090,1,I was reluctant to buy another pair of Crocs since the ones I have are the original bulky style. I was looking for a very comfortable pair of walking shoes that I could wear with pants and skirts and dresses while traveling. I was not disappointed. These Mary Jane Crocs are diminutive yet very comfortable.
187431,1,"These were a replacement to the last pair I had for 12 years. They may be pricey, but you sure get your money's worth out of them. I'm saving up to get them in black too!"
256366,1,"I can't even tell you how happy I am with my new crocs. The most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Not really the best looking, but definitely the most comfortable."
273461,0,"I saw these navy blue w/white polka dot shoes online, and loved them!! They are super cute, and look great on my foot! The wedge woven part looks well constructed, but I was somewhat surprised about the material of the upper part - I didn't think that it would be as silky shiny as it is. Regardless - still cute!!They are, however, not very comfortable. They only seem to come in 8.5 & 9.5 - no 9?? I got the 8.5 & they seem to be a snug fit, but the heel keeps slipping off when I walk. I end up walking awkwardly to keep these on my feet. I am hoping that they mold to my feet a little better, and I will continue to wear them, but will plan for occasions that involve little walking."
52539,1,"Right out of the box, these are the most comfortable walkers I've ever had. I have arthritis in my knees and these shoes help to stabilize my stride so I can walk farther without pain. I will definitely buy more of these so I can have a pair in each color."
233867,1,These shoes fit great and look cool. They were shipped on time and looked exactly as described. My son's friends complimented him on his new shoes!
277068,1,These are comfortable and easy to slip on. These will also be good for surgery
160329,1,"I like the retro style of these shoes, very well made and a decent price. I wish the tongue of the show was wider and did not slide around as much."
373891,1,I received the shoes quickly and was pleasantly suprised with the product. My husband loves them so much I'm going to get myself a pair!
209867,0,"I indicated ""item NOT described by the seller"" because the sizing seems to be off. I've worn a 10 1/2 narrow for over 40 years. I've never had a ""fit"" problem until now. The Ariat's seemed to be about two sizes too small. I could not even begin to get my foot into the boot.HOWEVER, the quality seemed fine; delivery was on time. It took only slightly over a week to get the refund to my credit card after shipping back the boots. I'm leery of trying to order another pair online since I am out the cost of the return shipment."
118202,1,I love Capezio products! This shoe is well made and holding up great under constant wear. The shoe size was right on the money.
208405,1,"Well, ten dollar shoes. Great price. I love how everyone is complaining about how they are 1 size smaller than what they say.Actually you're WRONG. Asics is a company based in Kobe. If you looked at the seller's size charts, you would have clearly seen the international size chart.So it was more of your error for not selecting the correct size. So please, don't complain about the Flat. These reviews are about the QUALITY of the item...not about how it wasn't what you ordered. They gave you exactly what you wanted.So people, look at the size chart. &lt;3"
82963,0,"umm..these sandals are comfortable but kind of big..I selected the right size but it was kind of big..but it's not too bad. overall, good quality and comfortable :)"
380634,1,"I'm what I like to call, ""hard to fit"" when it comes to shoes. I have a wide foot and can wear anything from a size 9 to a size 10.5, depending on how the shoe is made and what sort of shoe it is. For example- in sneakers, I tend to purchase a 9 to 9.5- again, depending on how the sneaker is made. If its heels, I purchase anywhere from a 9.5 to a 10.5, depending on the width of the toe and the height of the heel. It really just depends on the shoe. I relate all this to relate my experience with this particular pair of shoes.I purchased the size 10.5 W and they're an absolutely perfect fit. The inside lining is soft and nicely padded- super comfy! I'm wearing these shoes for a play that requires me to be on my feet almost continuously for several hours and I have yet to experience any foot fatigue.Since I am fairly tall, I wanted something with a teeny bit of heel for a feminine look, but not so tall that I tower over the man who plays opposite me in the show. These shoes have a perfect height heel for me.I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone who will be on their feet for long periods of time.*One little note to mention- as with most character/dancing shoes, the bottom is quite slippery. If you're not adding taps, you may want to consider adding some rubber traction panels to the bottoms."
8150,1,"My 2&1/2 year old daughter has a really wide foot. We purchased this shoe in a wide from the store, but it wasn't wide enough. It was easier to order the same size but in an extra-wide without having to rush out to the original store of purchase to exchange. She loves her sandals. They are very cute and comfortable. They are easy for her to put on by herself with the velcro closure. Because she likes to run and play, I thought protecting her little toes was important. Also, she can wear these with shorts as well as sundresses."
126783,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
175715,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
280471,1,"the sizing is about a 1/2 large even with thick wool socks. recently used during a mountain trip. over 2 ft of snow, 5 degree weather. kept feet dry and warm. at this point would recommend."
363967,2,"I am, and always have been a Chuck Taylor fan. I am a 39 yr old mom of 5 and at one point or another, someone in my home owns a pair. My 16 yr old son wanted a pair of hi-top Chuck Taylors for Christmas. The picture of the ""unbleached"" pair, looked white, so I purchased them. When the box arrived, I wrapped it and placed it under the tree. Can you imagine my disappointment (and most importantly, my son's), when he opened the box and inside there was a yellowish stained pair of Chuck's?DO NOT BUY This ""unbleached"" color unless you want a yellow pair of sneakers.For the first time, sizing was as issue, as well. Runs almost a whole size larger."
111788,0,i bought this same boot for work last year and the damm boot this year...exact same boot ...is now shorter! not as high up the leg...but still vharging the same price.! so long sorel.
273643,1,this is the third pair of the shoe that i am ordering...excellent shoe...great for casual wear and for athletics...extremely durable and looks great...one of the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn.
279546,1,They are a great shoe and my granddaughter loves them. I got them in plenty of time to give them to her for her birthday.
81476,0,"I don't think that these shoes are original converse ,but in any case the quality is acceptable and they are true to size.It seems that one can not get original stuff these days."
64952,1,"I am so happy with my keds. They're my new go-to shows. I ordered a 7.5 (I normally wear somewhere between a 7 and 8) and while they fit, I think I would order a 7 if I were to purchase another pair. Stock up on no-show socks when you order them and enjoy!"
246905,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
328926,1,"Mom has special needs for her feet: wider feet now, needs a deeper toe area and needs back of slipper to cup the heal and not slip off when she walks. Also has a high instep so if slipper is not adjustable in that area she cannot get it on her foot. These slippers are perfect, ordered in the C/D width, plus they are very sturdy with a non-slip soul. She likes the rose color too. I have been searching for new slippers for her for months, thank you very much. We are both very pleased with this purchase."
380006,1,"These shoes need no breaking in. They are comfortable fromthe get-go. It is hard these days to find a pair of truly WHITE shoes.These fit the bill perfectly and are generic-looking enoughto go with any outfit. I originally ordered a pair for tap dancing.They were so comfortable to dance in that I ordered a pair for ""street"" shoesas well. Glad I did! (Remember to order one full size bigger than your regularshoe size when ordering these shoes.)"
362780,1,"VERY fast shipping. I bought shoes as a gift and was sure that they wouldn't be delivered in time, but they made with days to spare! And the shoes looked lovely. Thanks so much! :)"
174587,1,"Tengo estos zapatos desde hace mas de 4 a&ntilde;os; los compre originalmente para cross training, y termine utilizandolos para casi todo, son comodos y duraderos. Una recomendaci&oacute;n, verifiquen su talla en un vendedor local de Columbia."
379273,1,"Love the sandal. Great foot support. I have flat feet and have some arch problems and this sandal makes it possible for me to wear sandals, and not have aching feet, after wearing them."
285528,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
290006,1,The Bostonian Akron Oxford is my favorite dress shoe. They are very elegant and hold up well. It has a very nice leather sole as well. The price is more than many comparable brand but this is by far the best looking shoe for the price. You can't go wrong with these shoes!
70866,1,"I love flip flops but never had had any Tevas. Just in browsing, I discovered them and read the comments regarding the mush flip flops. Being curious, I ordered a pair. They were right, I love these and I'll always have a pair in my closet or on my feet from now on. These are wonderfully comfortable!"
253078,1,Definitely get one size smaller. My son usually takes a 15 and fit into a size 14 in the beeswax and they are solid without much give. Do not put protector on them as they already have a coating on them. Great boots!!!!
387201,1,"My wife loves these. They didn't break the bank and they are actually very comfortable (I know, I know... How do I know? I tried them on, I must admit!)"
5116,1,"En cuanto a calidad y precio Converse cumple con lo ofrecido, excelente calidad, durable y a la moda. Dispone para todos los gustos, edades, sin distincion, siempre innovadora"
361934,1,"I've worn these VANELi dress flats for years and have them in several colors...and highly recommend them for both comfort and quality. They are expensive, so I always wait for sales. However, the last few times I've ordered these shoes on sale from this store on Amazon, the shoes have felt like they are at least a half a size too small. Sadly, I've had to return them."
249197,0,"I gave this away as a gift. Slipper looks exactly as advertised but the company was Christies as in the pictures and not Slippers International, unless they are an affiliate? I was told the fleece is comfortable and warm. However the rubber sole is a bit heavy and I would not recommend it for an elderly person."
265501,1,"I purchased these in preparation of a hike up Mt. Leconte in Gatlinburg, TN. After breaking them in, they fit great. I didn't have a single problem the whole hike and look forward to using them for future hikes."
109226,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
196758,1,I purchased these fro my brother who has terrible problems with his feet. These seem to be about the only footwear that he handle for an entire day. I recommend these to anyone who has foot comfort issues.
40259,1,"These were very nice, just what I was looking for, my gf loves reef flip-flops and swears by them! she loves this pair and weras them even in the winter :) shipping was very fast and the flips were in perfect condition"
334574,1,"Hi, I'm from Colombia, it is the first time that I buy in Amazon and the product that I received was in conditions excelents, I'm very excited with the product !!! Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot,Grey/Grey,7 M US"
94110,1,"These shoes were recommended by my manager at work. Since I have some pretty serious spine problems, and her husband does as well, he has been wearing these shoes for a long time, and he loves them. I figured why not, lets check them out. I ordered these in my normal size, even though some of the other reviews said to try a half size larger. I absolutely LOVE my Merrells. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. My toes do not get pinched, and my legs and feet are not sore and tired after a 9 hour shift in the store I work for. I can honestly say I will never buy another brand of shoes again, since Merrell makes all sorts of different styles of shoes and boots, even sandals!! Well worth the cost of the shoes, since they have very good tread, and I cannot imagine I would be walking through the soles on these in a matter of months, like I was doing with normal sneakers, even the most expensive of sneakers I would walk through the soles in 6 months or less."
59829,1,"These are the most comfortable boots I've ever worn. I have large calves, but these boots zip right up. They are very beautiful and I love wearing them."
35839,1,"We are now a Chuck Taylor family! Every one has a pair of these great sneakers and I highly recomend them to everyone! Great quality, and the fact that they come in pink for my little princess is priceless!"
353554,0,Like the height but they gave me blisters. It would have been better in the material was straight across instead of crossed so little toes don't get rubbed raw.
81531,1,I ordered these shoes for my son who is a Crossfit Trainer. He wears a size 13 shoe so this is what I ordered. When the shoes arrived they were at least 2 sizes too large. My son said that they measured at least a size 14/15. I had to return them. So if you are ordered these remember that they run very large.
219683,0,"I love these shoes. However, I ordered the wrong size and exchanging them has been a hassle. It has been over a month and I do not have the shoes or the money and no one can seem to help me."
388932,1,i've been kicking around my NYC classics for a few months now. one of my favorite shoes. one pair still fresh in the box in my closet. i've seen people buying them but have never seen anyone else sporting them cross my path.
264746,0,....but my wife reports that it does not fil her foot very well. It is the smallest 5.5 shoe she has ever had....
309303,1,"Very comfortable. The ""W"" really does mean Wide. If you have wide feet, you know that first thought when trying on new shoes, ""Oh, they,ll feel better when they've stretched a little."" Not with these. They fit right away. They fit when I put them on and they still fit after they are broken in. Good quality. I like the shoes a lot, I just don't give 5 stars unless I find something amazing. I would certainly purchase another pair."
90712,1,"While slightly less polished than it appears in the picture, I've now owned this shoe for nearly four months, worn it to work on a near-daily basis, and it remains in great condition.Valuable information that I didn't see in the product description: the sole marks floors, so if you'd like to avoid streaking hardwood, tile, or linoleum wherever you walk, either pick up your feet or buy a different shoe!"
374825,0,"Cons-Extremely Stiff-Way to narrow-Long soles (like short snow skis)-Heavy-Squeaks at the ankles.Pros-Very DurableEven after 3 years, these boots are still taxing to wear. However like many others, my partners on duty love these boots."
123925,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
353008,1,"Great shoes, order a size larger than you normally wear. Very warm and comfortable."
206644,2,"I've sworn by Adidas for years. Tennis shoes, trail runners, and basketball shoes. They always fit perfect and last forever...until I bought the T7 ATS Trail Shoe. My very first run yielded a small tear in the fragile mesh covering the toes. The very next run resulted in the sole of the shoe beginning to peal off near the ball of the foot. I was shocked. I've been able to stop the damage, at least temporarily, with shoe goo, but I have a pair of Adidas Estes trail runners almost 10 years old that have needed no mending. I've put them through the paces in Africa twice and back to Colorado. I may put these new T7's out to pasture and go back to my old ones. Don't buy these. They look good but may tear from looking at them too hard."
284071,1,this is the third pair of the shoe that i am ordering...excellent shoe...great for casual wear and for athletics...extremely durable and looks great...one of the most comfortable shoes ive ever worn.
371470,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
222934,1,"These are the best shoes I have ever worn in any sport. I play senior ""over 50"" slow pitch softball and the cushion in these are gentle on old knees. Several ladies on the team bought them and all rave about them."
380819,1,"I needed shoes for a burlesque dance class. Many people recommended capezio. These shoes are lightweight, comfortable and true to size. Highly recommended"
191221,1,Love the shoe! It's kinda retro but it feels great. Exceeds my expectations. What more can I say? It's a Reebok!
312328,0,Please see my full review on the other location for this item. Fit great but sure didnt last as long as my old durashocks.
117803,1,"First of all these shoes look awesome. I got them for about 22 dollars and they were perfect. Shipped on time and packaging was excellent. Also they are light and thin but they are meant to be so for running purposes. Also they are very very strong on the bottom as in their sole so they will hold up for awhile. Also I use them for running only every now and then and they look great enough to where you can wear them as sneakers. This is because the spikes on the bottom are removable, comes with a handy tool for it."
137001,1,I would be very greatful if u can let me know if the white chucks is one size bigger then nornal sizing cause I didnt see the remarks like on the black ones.Thanks
58196,1,Keds are good quality and very comortable. These will last a long time. They have good width and arch support.
100913,1,"My daughter likes them. They fit well. Her dance teacher was excited, as she thinks this is a quality brand ballet shoe."
119529,1,"My orginal order was too big, however the instructions on how to reorder and ship back so as to maintain the free shipping offer were very clear and concise. The new pair arrived very quickly and were exactly as expected."
344722,1,Terrifically comfortable shoes. I wear mine to work in the office. (I am a physician in private practice.)
67973,0,"I love the look and durability of Timberland boots. I wear them to work every night, but these boots ran very narrow and they hurt my feet. However, if you aren't going to wear them for 8 hrs. I think they would be OK."
182293,0,"usually reef products are a bit more comfortable than this, but they're okay. i basically just needed white flip flops to wear for dancing at my wedding reception. i couldn't find any at a store, especially since i like ones w/ fabric straps (not plastic). these fit the bill - they aren't anything special, but they get the job done."
75714,1,"Excellent quality shoes, very fast shipping and great price. As fast as children grow, this is a wonderful place to buy dance shoes."
367804,0,"The black version of the Itasca SeaRay Slides arrived on time and in a box. They fit and are moderately comfortable. For the $30 or so shipped, they are about what i would expect. But, these are not some deeply discounted irregulars or end of line, though they may actually be. The are worth the $24.99. The smell of rubber was dominant when i opened up the box. there is no more than a flat piece of thin material separating the rubber from the removable insert. They are light and do fit comfortably but do not , by any means compare to the other higher line mocs that happen to go on some drastic sale and if i am lucky enough to find my size at the same time they go on sale-once every 3years. maybe. So, these seemed to be ok out of the box. i am wearing them and went for a walk without them breaking down and without getting any blisters. They do have a nice back for the achilles tendon and some foam in it with a center portion cut down for easier entry and removal, not much support but a nicer addition. there are elastic gores on each side with very little stretch to them but fine. my size was on target.the only real issue was that these were no way first quality or regular. there are glue spots all over the toe and fronts of both shoes. not little ones but sizable and 4 on one shoe and a couple on the other. they do not come off. At first , i thought it was only dust from shipping or a shelf storage. only it didnt come off with a light brushing nor with some water on a cloth. For me, it isnt a big deal because i always spill something i am cooking on my new shoes the first time i wear them anyway. I cant help it, always have, I used to cook for a living and now for amusement so am used to having a couple of oil spots on everything. Some people might be put off by the glue drips. I dont really mind but would normally want to be the one who gets the first spots or stains on my shoes (or shirts) thinking that this time I will keep them in perfect shape for more than a day.For the price i paid ,no problem, had i paid the 'full price' listed on the screen of $60, i would have returned them today-the day i got them."
205447,1,"The shoe size is NOT equivalent to a street shoe size. The Plie I sizing is much smaller than your street shoe. I have worn an 8.5 shoe (trainer/sneaker, dress heel, boot) for as many years as I have been an adult, and I cannot fully get the ball of my foot into my 8.5 Plie I's. I have to sell them as a consequence. I don't know who decided that these are a street shoe size match, but they are delusional!!"
353011,2,I have been buying these for years under HURON from HUSHPUPPIES but they are no longer available? They would last for years and I wear them all day in and outside. The only reason to replace them was when they got wet too often they eventually lose some of the look they had. Why so many colors listed and only one available all the time?Now AI pourchased a first pair of Minnetonka this year and a second pair already 7 months later. This products is definately not worth the money! Please make sure this complaint reaches the manufacturer! Wish former product would come back on the market! Ties never stay tied and I had to tie them tight to hold the shoe on all the time!DEFINATELY DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS PRODUCT and I never write these kind of reviews but this was called for!
154184,1,"Love my Docs. Most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. This is my 4th pair - I tried a pair with the thinner out-soles, but they ""sprung a leak"" (I did wear the heck out of them though...), so now I'm back to the big, thick, traditional Dr. Marten soles."
109147,0,They are about half a size small. So if you are a 7.5 you need to order 8 or even 8.5. Not really comprable to finer designer shoes but not extremely bad.
224786,1,"These shoes were shipped quickly, and were exactly as described. My son is thrilled with them. Thanks!"
86112,1,"Just buy them!!! Thyre used by the most ellegant players in the world. Their rubber outsole improves grip on every surface, and their frontal and lateral mesh surface lets the air flow. Plus, they wigh only 10.2 grs."
125939,1,"I've owned about 7 pairs of KC shoes and I've always gotten size 7.5M. When these shoes came, they were quite larger than the size 7.5 KC boots I was wearing. Amazon has a great return policy. I was able to return these in the same package - no charge to me. I only had to drop them off at a UPS Store, which was on my way home from work. They sent me a size 7M pair in just a 2 day turn around (before receiving the pair I returned). Thanks Amazon!As for the shoe - very nice style, can be worn with a suit (they are very shiny, borderline patent leather - so if you prefer a matted finish or dull finish - avoid these shoes), or even with some khaki's or denim. The insole is very comfy and not too soft. I do walk quite a bit and so far they walk well, but they do have a large heel, which I don't mind since I only stand 61"". Overall, a great pair of shoes for this price. My only gripe would be that the sole itself is made of rubber, so once it wears down the shoes become unusable as you can't replace the heel, but if they hold out for at least 2 years I'll be a happy camper."
46044,0,"This shoe looks great with various outfits, including shorts, skirts & capris. Not true to size. I ordered a 7W but shoe fits like a medium width. Very rare for LifeStride shoes, most wide widths fit perfectly."
309997,1,"quick response, fast delivery, great shoes for just about any outfit."
83864,1,"I've bought several pair thongs over the years but keep coming back to these. as the description says, very feminine look...no clunkiness. I have no problems wearing them with skirts, capris, skinny jeans...they work with everything!can't leave out that they are so comfortable and sturdy as well.."
273892,1,"I wouldn't have picked these up had my sister not told me her friend had purchased one in every color. When I put them on, I was sold. They are very, very comfortable!! The toe box is wide and the proportions are generous, so be sure to order a half size down from your regular size."
31891,0,"I can't give a five-star or other rating until I actually use the product and see how it holds up. But so far so good. The boots look good and they fit. Some reviewers have complained that the boots are too small. I wear a 10 and 1/2 shoe and bought the XL. They ARE snug, to be sure. But if I take a plastic shopping bag such as you would receive from a grocery store and put my shoe (with foot inserted) into the bag and then into the boot, the fit is fine."
90083,0,"Although they were too tight around the ankles for me, they were well made and thick. Would have been perfect in the cold and snow."
349672,1,"I've never been much of one for fancy shoes. Sure, I love the way they look, but I end up wearing them once, then stowing them to the ever-growing stash in the bottom of my closet.When I bought this shoe in the blushing bride/heather color last fall from a catalog, I expected another candidate for that stack in my closet. A shoe with the playful, sporty, yet somehow feminine details of this one simply isn't practical...right?Then they came and I tried them on.I hate to admit it, but I am now a Puma athletic shoe addict. Every pair is sporty and trendy, yet has a classical styling that is somehow sophisticated and traditional. They work for me because they're pracitcal enough to go running in, but stylish enough to wear with jeans or a sporty minidress.There's not much else to say. These are the most comfortable cute shoes I've ever had, plain and simple. They are, by far, the most versatile shoes I've ever owned. BUY THEM!"
122584,1,"I needed to replace shoelaces in a 5-eyelet child's shoe -- the 45"" laces were perfect -- enough length for double knots."
29446,1,"Soooo comfortable!!! I love wearing these shoes. They are stylish, comfortable, easy to clean, and most important you don't have to be bothered with annoying laces...just slip them on!! I find that Skechers run on the big side so I would recommend you order at least a half size smaller than you normally would."
333536,1,"These skechers are a great way to look good while exercising! They were true to size. Two small problems I have are: they are a little skinny (so if your foot tends to be wide, I wouldn't recommend), and the back of the shoe comes a little too high up the back of my foot. This doesn't bother me, but I can see how it might rub and bother some people."
336214,1,I love my new crocs! They fit really well also! I honestly have not taken them off since I got them!
49900,0,"These boots are super cute. I actually purchased them for a Halloween costume. Because I have small feet and wide calves, I thought the lace-up feature would help. It does help, however the tongue is too small so it looks weird. I think they're my best option, so I'll take them to a shoe-repair place to have a wider tongue and longer laces put on. From what I could tell, they felt fairly comfortable in the foot though."
50165,0,"I received these 2 days ago and as I have worn boots for a long time I know there is a break in period, but honstly I would rather walk barefoot on concrete. The sole is so hard that it sends pain up through your feet half way up your calf. I bought a pair of gel inserts today and that has helped some. I gave them 3 stars because they seem to be of decent quality materials and well made even though they are made in China. They are quite comfortable when not walking I guess thats why they call them trucker boots, if you don't have to walk much you should be fine."
249,1,This is my fourth set of Hi Tec boots. They are the only shoe I own that never hurt my feet. They are made well and last.
121913,1,"Shoes arrived, but wrong size. Do NOT use the sizing info next to the size selection. It shows a US size 10 as a Euro 27 (which I ordered), but the seller uses a different sizing chart and sent a Euro 28 which, according to the sizing info on the website, is a US size 11."
247997,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
92509,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
212493,1,"My wife, like many women has a closet full of shoes that are too tight, too loose or have some other distracting feature that will almost eliminate their being worn. These sandals, however are and have been her favorites for a very long time. So long that they finally wore out and these were their replacements. Having peripheral neuropathy, my wife needs all the footwear comfort she can muster up. While these sandals are not exactly for dress wear they fully meet her everyday needs. Guess we had better order out more as i`m afraid they may stop making them and then we will be ""up the creek with no paddle""."
384910,1,"These are so comfy. I bought the mustard color b/c my 11 yo son took over my brown Gap flip flops. I picked a color that boys wouldn't want, so he wouldn't adopt them. ;)They feel fabulous on. I'm tempted to come back and buy all the girly colors."
209924,1,"you will enjoy these puppies - good construction throughout. not OVERLY tickled in the color, but it is OK for the OTHER pair of hikers (to give the main ones a break). this may be only MY foot, but the right side tends to have a permanent shift to the left side of the insole during use: this is NOT uncomfortable in the least - just LOOKS a wee bit funky LOL overall though, def worth the price paid - no doubt"
226553,1,"My orginal order was too big, however the instructions on how to reorder and ship back so as to maintain the free shipping offer were very clear and concise. The new pair arrived very quickly and were exactly as expected."
13094,0,"This shoe looks great with various outfits, including shorts, skirts & capris. Not true to size. I ordered a 7W but shoe fits like a medium width. Very rare for LifeStride shoes, most wide widths fit perfectly."
194865,1,"Man, This Shoes are so confortable. The only bad thing is that there just are in black and white."
146030,1,"LOVE Uggs. I don't care if they're nicknamed ""Ugg-ly"", they're meant to keep your feet nice and warm. Plus they're sooo comfy. Make sure you order 1/2 size less than your normal. (So if you wear 6.5, get 6) I got the black ones for $[...] shipped with no tax! =) Super happy."
236566,1,"This is an all-around great pair of wrestling shoes! I train MMA a little bit and with some of the drills the mats basically shave off the skin on my feet and I used to get blisters too! With these I get great grip and protection for my feet and if you tie them up correctly then you get good ankle support too.One thing, keep off of carpet while wearing them. Pet hair and lint sticks to the bottom like glue (the bottom is rubber in some areas) and therefore reduces traction until you clean them off (lick your finger and rub the rubber and it takes the dirt off).They are very comfortable too, and I have big feet so it's hard to find comfy shoes. I'd wear these everywhere if they didnt wet through so bad in rain and snow."
192086,1,"I ordered this shoe in white, I was very skeptical because of the price, but I was not disappointed, they were comfortable I loved them they set my black bubble dress off, I got tons of compliments. LOVE these shoes I will be ordering 2 more pair of them the red and the black"
255302,2,"It is unfortunate. After wearing the shoes for a week, the shoe gives a black mark on top of my daughter's right foot because the flap is too hard and long for her. Since she have already wore them for a few days... I am reluctant to ask for a refund."
386363,1,"I got these sneakers for my husband after months of searching in stores. New Balance must not make them too much anymore. Anyway, our entire family owned a pair at one point and we must say it is by far the most comfortable, lightweight sneakers we have ever worn. Considering the price and comfort it is an excellent deal."
373867,1,"I'm a big fan of these. They're comfortable enough to walk around all day in, and sturdy enough to hold up to moderate wear and tear. The only thing that's a bit disappointing is that the tread and insole seem to break down quickly."
97065,1,"At first was worried about fit, but as I tried it on it was amazingly great snug fit. Needed a great price shoes for working out and these shoes will do the job since it is a flat shoe that will work great for it."
378280,0,"I got the black Women's size 7 tap shoes and they look nice. The heel was just the right height, but no taps included?! They weren't put on the shoes nor were they included in the box. This is weird. Now I notice that the photo in amazon featured just the shoes with no taps. I should've been more observant! Now I have to purchase the taps from a specialty dance store and go to a shoe repair shop to have the taps put on professionally. Beware."
116684,2,"So I decided to still give this product a try despite the reviews saying that the sizing is way off. I measured my daughter's feet carefully like one reviewer suggested. Her foot measures a little less than 6"", which would be between size 8 and 8.5. I went ahead and ordered her a size 9 and it still didn't fit!! The problem lies in the company stated shoe size vs the sizing info provided by Amazon. The shoes itself only measure 5.75"" which is not what the sizing info states for size 9. Her big toes are curled up inside. So now, we have to return the item and pay for shipping because according to Amazon, it's not their fault. Really cute shoes, but yeah, the sizing is like playing roulette, you never know what you would get!"
241142,1,"This company was excellent to deal with. When we received the shoes, they didn't fit properly. Exchanging them was a breeze and another size was promptly sent to us at no extra charge to us. Very efficient."
140213,1,"I've been wearing these for years. They are the most comfortable, long lasting sneakers I have ever owned. I like the slim line to these. I don't care much for the big bulky looking ones."
309649,1,I bought these boots for my 8 year old son and am very pleased with them. he's had them for a month now and they're still in pretty good shape and that's saying something because he's very hard on shoes.
171215,1,Very comfortable for my narrow foot. Will buy in other colors. Had more style than others I have found in stores
259065,1,"These shoes were a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she loves them.. She says they are very comfortable and snazzy.When these Converse shoes wear out, she will purchase another pair."
160537,1,Converse's are classic. they are the shoes people are always going to wear. i like the high tops better though
163587,1,"I have lots and lots of problems wearing shoes. I find many women's shoes too constraining and tight, and have had various problems with my feet over the years that seem to just boggle the podiatrist. Putting me in orthotics seemed to make things much worse, as did just about any arch insert or other things inserted into the shoe. Most sneakers become almost unbearable to wear after several hours, and over time I've found that a light shoe with basic support worked best for me. I'd had good luck with some other easy spirit shoes so gave this one a try. And it is really amazing how comfortable this shoe is for me. It's so rare that a shoe fits and is comfortable without a serious break-in period, but this particular style just works that way for me, and I just hope they never discontinue it! I've tried a few other Easy Spirit shoes, even some walking shoes that look very similar but they just never seem to be as comfortable as this one. It definitely would not be the choice for someone who needs a lot of arch support and a really solid sidewall, but if you like very light shoes, this is an excellent one to try."
261563,1,"Been wearing converse for years; great shoes, came just as promised in the picture and description. Cheaper, even with the shipping expenses, then in the stores where you can find all black chucks. Shoes packaged very well; shipping was ridiculously fast, had it in two days; great amazon experience!"
40550,1,"A great basic flip flop, goes with anything but can be more than just super casusal!"
40391,1,"I love this flip flop! It's sooo comfortable and has some arch support. Size was true to form. I highly recommend buying a pair! The only thing that I didn't like is that I got the brown flip flop with the white thong, and the white is getting noticeably dirty. I will definitely be buying more!!!"
190730,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
724,1,My sons 1st pair of pre-school shoes. Very Dapper!! He looks like a big boy!!
127045,1,This show is so comfortable and looks great with anything. Light weight with clean lines. No need to wear them in. They are instantly comfortable.
349334,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
291383,1,I had never tried this brand before but I got them while they were on sale and I love them.. The quality is awesome.. I keep watching for other styles of them to go on sale.
839,1,"I ordered my boots because they sounded great. I am not disappointed,they are great right out of the box.Fit well except the tongue is very short and could fit better around the ankle more. My order was delayed because of the snow but i am happy to finally be wearing them. Thank you very much for selling these fine and affordable boots. P.S I will spread the word to all the people i know who want happy feet. signed Mark Berglund"
9139,1,"I love Keds and they're always true to size, so nice to know I can order them here. I'll likely order more."
39818,2,"I wear 8.5 to size 9. 9's were an entire size too small. They don't issue exchanges, by the time I would return them I'd lose half of what I'd paid in shipping costs, deducted and what I'd have to pay to return. They feel pretty flimsy also!"
256423,0,I bought these crocs size 2XL 12/13. I wear size 13 2E and they feel rather tight. My toes are punching out the front holes of these clogs. I had the crocs chinese imitation size 13 and they feel more comfortable than the originals.Please be warned that these crocs are smaller than the one that came before.I think I should have bought the crocs baya or clasic as they come in whole sizes rather than a range of sizes. My foot always end up at the larger end of the range.
266728,0,"Expensive shoes, I was really excited about it but got a little dissapointed with it, quality little low, materials seems to be cheap"
277424,1,"I puchased a pair of these for a 16 mile hiking trip. out of the box, no joke, these were(are) the most comfortable pieces of footwear i have ever had on my feet. as for the water proof part, i have found these boots are superior! during my hike it rained overnight and the next morning hiking through mud and rain my feet stayed completely dry. i also purchased another pair of these for work and daily wear because they are so comfortable, and part of my job as an auto-body technician is detailing a car after it is painted for customer pick-up. the drain in the shop at work is very poor, and during washing a car, u find yourself standing in a 2 inch puddle of water and my feet stay dry all day in these boots.i would also like to add that your feet stay warm in these boots. i usually wear normal socks, but when i go hiking or camping i wear warm thick socks. either way your feet stay warm"
80483,1,NOTHING CAN EVER TAKE THE PLACE OF A TRIED & TRUE PAIR OF CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STARS. (WE CALLED THEM BO-BOS IN THE 70'S)
372279,1,"Product was just as advertised. Only concern was that I did not receive a tracking number so I had no idea when exactly it would arrive. Other than that, great seller =)"
25618,0,"The quality was what I expected from a Clarks product, but disappointed that it was at least one size too big."
376637,1,"I purchased these shoes for my daughter to start school this fall. I got them on an excellent sale for only $15.00. After receiving them, I would have gladly paid the retail price based on the quality and durability of these shoes. You can't go wrong with Stride Right brand shoes anyway."
125030,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
373110,1,"This shoe provides excellent stability. It's very comfortable and roomy enough for orthotics, but it is quite heavy and clunky looking."
206404,1,"I was desperately trying to find a pair of crocs for my grandson after a major order mess-up from the Crocs website. That is how I found this seller on Amazon. This seller was fast, efficient and reasonably priced. They also had a huge inventory of shoes in all colors and sizes. I would highly recommend this seller and would never hesitate to order from them again. My order was received within 4 days. Awesome timing."
94551,1,"I absolutely wore my other pair out. I have wide,high arch feet and hard to fit.These are great walking shoes"
211612,1,"I got these shoes really fast and hate taking them off. They are comfortable and sleek. I have to keep them cleaned, but I still think it is worth it. I wear them every chance I get."
147738,0,I took a chance and purchased these as a Christmas gift. When I bought them I was not 100% sure they were real UGGs or not. When I contacted UGG they told me this company is not an authorized dealer and cautioned me that these might be knock-offs. When they arrived I noticed that these boots were made in China. I found that there are several dealers selling a lot of these on the internet and they are shipped from China. According to UGG and other sources (Norton for one)they are selling counterfeit boots. Bottom line is that so far these appear to be of good quality but I am still unsure if they are the real deal or knock-offs that are over priced.
370414,1,"Bought these for my boyfriend. He LOVES them. They are very sturdy and the leather is thick enough not to tear or anything. He uses them as hiking boots. As far as I know they are true to size and comfortable. I bought different (darker) laces for them because the ones they come with are kind of light and they look weird, but laces are cheap."
279430,1,This item was a gift. It was received in time for Christmas 2011. received in great condition. The shoes are super comfortable and very stylish. Great buy! 2 thumbs up!
336252,1,"Granted, at first glance one may not be too impressed with the looks of these shoes. I was one of these people. However, on a trip to Maine, I needed a pair of shoes that would serve well on land as well as in the water on trails and on the oceans. That being said, I discovered the true toughness and comfort of these shoes. I even hiked up a 3,000 foot mountain in these things and they still exhibit modest wear on the soles and around the entire shoe. This was extremely rocky and rugged terrain to boot and would not advise this as the primary terrain to tackle with Crocs.SIZINGI am a true 10.5 in mens. However, 10 was definitely too small and uncomfortable for me, so I bought size 11 since there are no half sizes. From this discovery, it is safe to say that Crocs are pretty true to size. 11s are a little big on me, but the strap still locks my foot in place and it does not feel like my foot is coming out of the shoe if I am not using the strap. The foam material Crocs are made from grips your feet pretty well, even when wet or sweaty.COMFORTThere are not many shoes, even shoes I've spent over $100, that can match Crocs in comfort. I could wear these shoes all day and my feet would not hurt or blister while on the trails. On a regular day out, same story. For summer, they are great because air is constantly able to flow through and cool your feet. When they get wet, I mean completely soaked, they usually will dry off within about 5 minutes.STYLEThese are really not as ugly as people think. Once you wear them and get them on, they really start to grow on you both on how they look and how they feel. People who say they hate these shoes are those who have never put a pair on and worn them (I was one of these people). As far as colors go, white and lighter colors seem like they will definitely get dirty easily. I have black and they are easy to clean of, just a rinse and rub down with a rag.The main thing is people just have to have an open mind when purchasing this style of footwear. They are a little unorthodox but they are high quality, functional, and as bad looking as people think. They are so easy just to slip on and they are featherweight and easy to walk in. I use them a lot for just getting the mail or going to the gym before I put my gym shoes on. I have been pleasently surprised with Crocs' resilience and highly recommend these bad boys."
333163,0,"This pair of slide looks great on the website. However, it hurt my feet after I walked with it for 30 minutes."
36911,1,"i have a pair of light pink keds that i've had for 10+ years. when my 17 year old daughter said keds are cool again, i decided to get a pair of red. buying from amazon i saved a bunch, and they still fit and look the same quality as my originals. i love them!"
364691,1,I love the all black - so far they fit well. We will have to see how they wear in the long run but chucks are usually durable
52671,1,"I'm on my feet more than 8 hours a day and these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I also suffer from a plantar fibroma and these shoes really help to relieve the pressure and discomfort from it. This is my second pair, my first lasted over a year so they hold up really well too!"
198265,1,"I was very pleased to get these shoes, they're very iconic no matter where you go and look great with just about any casual outfit. But after about 10 months of having these, rips between the rubber parts of the shoe and the cloth began to seperate. I'm not sure whether this is due to how my feet fit within the shoe. After trying to fix the seams myself, the shoes soon began to just fall apart really and just became really unwearable. If they were cheaper I would consider getting a second pair and maybe another different pair of shoes along with them. Overall they're still nice shoes, but they may need to be pampered somewhat for them to last a long time."
368993,0,"these flip flops are pretty comfortable but hurt a little between the toes after a few hours. i like the tread, wish they came in white."
226583,1,Love my chucks. This is my second pair. The blue goes with everything. I teach preschool and they are comfortable and fun to wear to work.
331680,1,I have tried knock offs and they are terrible. I bought a pair for my husband as well and he loved them too. They are great for vacation travel. Perfect for the airport where you have to take your shoes off. Comfortable and perfect for walking to the beach or around a cruise ship. They do run a little big though. You may want to go down a size.
230533,1,"Looks awesome. feels firm, but not the most comfortable. I don't know how long it will last though! It seems like there may be some parts of the shoe that could just come off at some point."
312870,0,"The crocs are okay it's the seller that is not okay! The crocs broke second day of vacation. I wrote the seller. The seller told me they would send extra clips whioh was fine but if these broke, I would have to contact the factory. They (the seller) DO NOT stand by the products they sell. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! ELECTRIKID - not sure of the exact spelling."
302440,1,This is the cutest pair of black shoes I've ever purchased for my little girl.Love them!samantha's mom
278677,1,"took these boots backpacking this past weekend and they performed above expectation. waterproofing stood up to mud and stream crossings. After looking at more expensive brands I am more than happy I bought the Hi-Tec Altitude. After 18 miles these boots were still comfortable with no blisters on my feet. Affordable, lightweight,rugged,waterproof comfortable and stylish. If you overlook these you are missing out on a superb value."
272342,1,"The sneakers arrived in a timely fashion, as promised. They were exactly what my son wanted. They were priced reasonably.They were of high quality and true to size. Thank you, Amazon"
91025,1,"These sandals are very comfortable and I am very pleased with this purchase. Shipping was speedy. I do feel, however, that the size ran a little small."
282005,1,Very comfortable and stylish! Love the colors and the double layer sole. Rainbows are good quality sandals. I wear a size 11 shoe and I ordered the Large and they fit perfectly.
237127,1,Thank you! Quick service and just as described. Perfect fit!
66391,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
361629,1,"Well, what more can I say? They are nice shoes for the dress blues... I had trouble finding the ones I could manually polish, but these work... Just make sure not to scuff them... Because for the most part, scuffs do not come out... Cleaning them is simple and can be done with windex. The shipping was also quick, faster than Vanguard's second day, even though I did standard shipping with these... But they get the job done..."
285649,1,"The Adidas Copa Mundial (Copa Mundial means World Cup in Spanish) initially came out in 1979, but was designed for the 1982 FIFA World Cup games in Spain. I purchased my first pair of Copas two decades ago for $60. Although the Copas have increased in price and have slightly changed since that time, I continue to wear this shoe for a number of reasons. The 100% kangaroo leather upper is extremely comfortable and soft. I suggest buying the shoe a little snug and allowing the thin leather to stretch and mold to your foot. I also like the classic and humble look of the shoe. These shoes don't draw attention to you like a lot of the ugly shoes on the market do today. They do allow you to use your skills to help your team to the best of your abilities. It should be noted that two years ago Adidas came out with a 25th anniversary package for the Copas. The limited-edition package included a bunch of extras (wooden shoe trees, a key chain, etc.) that I do not think are needed."
262139,1,Really great shoes. My husband loves them. Very comfortable and lightweight shoes.
13875,1,"I ordered the Mimosa sandal in 7E Camel. It is true to size and comfortable. I love the style, looks dressy even as a low heel. The footpad inside is man-made material, but with stockings it is comfortable. Too bad the footpad isn't microfiber or something like that."
139783,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
349498,1,"These boots are great, I bought them to go with my halloween costume a while back and now I wear them every time I go out. Its been 7 months now and there still in great condition."
217781,1,THE SHOES WERE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAD. HE IS OLD SKOOL TO SAY THE LEAST. THE SHOES WERE LIKE PEOPLE BUYING THROWBACK JERSEYS. HE HAS NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOES. TRUST ME THE SHOES HAVE GOT TO BE COMFORTABLE OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RETUTNED INSTANTLY.
207707,1,I was pleased with the entire transaction from the ordering to delivery. Product was just exactly what I wanted and ordered. Thank you!
345903,1,"I have bought these shows for maybe 40 years, I always loved them, and bought this pair for my daughter. She loves them, good to see a longlasting long loved product withstand the test of time."
81547,1,"My orginal order was too big, however the instructions on how to reorder and ship back so as to maintain the free shipping offer were very clear and concise. The new pair arrived very quickly and were exactly as expected."
163181,1,"I have been wanting these shoes for some time now but when I would go to buy them, they didnt carry my size. People would just tell me that chucks didnt come in half sizes and would want me to by a size that didnt fit me. I knew better went online and got them cheaper and with free shipping. I love the internet"
356424,1,"I just got these shoes- the soles are uncomfortable, but they were on $13 and they look pretty nice- a good deal on a shoe you will just wear every once in a while for the looks."
357826,0,"I bought these for tap shoes for my daughter. Shoes are good quality did not realize in the fine print, TAPS NOT INCLUDED. Could have bought shoes for less else where with taps."
37109,1,"These are extremely good sneakers! I bought a brand new pair of black womens Keds Champion sneakers at a Sal. Army store I frequent quite a bit for only 4 dollars. These are great basic shoes. An older relative saw them and said they wore them during jr. high school in the 1950s as part of their gym uniform. I prefer these classic everyday shoes over something with more padding and more modern. These are very flexable shoes, the laces are better than other brands. These sell for around $30 generally. For that price I feel that makes them one of the most affordable shoes on the market. If you like old school Converse, Jack Purcell, Vans then I think you'll be very happy to own these classic shoes. A lot of the skateboard companies make copies of these and classic Vans. Just go with the originals! If I could afforf it I'd own 10 pairs but am thinking about buy 2 more pair right now. The other styles Keds now makes look great as well. If you happen to go to thrift stores check out the womens footwear. I find lots of Keds there and scored another new pair for $5 about 2 weeks after finding these.These shoes feel right and work well for all activities. No downsides to these that I can see. 5 stars!!"
215784,1,Pretty comfortable sandal. Size runs large so purchase the size smaller if you are a 1/2 size. Heel dresses the original up.
351471,2,"While these shoes are pretty, they are THE most uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn (and I wear heels every day). I can barely make it to my desk and back to my car in one day with these shoes on. Don't buy them, you will regret it."
18785,1,"I bought these shoes for my 17 year old daughter. They were ""perfect"" for her Cosplay outfit as the Anime character ""Panty"" who she dressed as for the Anime Boston Convention. Her only complaint was they didn't ""breathe"" enough for foot comfort as she wore them & walked all around the convention center for hours. But she still loves them!"
138792,0,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not &#34;tall&#34; enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
153332,1,soft under the foot..easy to slip on....never a bit of foot pain and can walk with a nice amount of padding...I have them in 5 colors...the daily shoe
306236,0,this is a really good shoe for the price. it is comfortable. a little thin unless you run on PERFECT level ground.
374002,1,"It took me awhile to find these shoes. My husband wears them in a wide width. His other ones wore out. I was so happy to find him a new pair & he loves them, says they are so comfortable. Well worth the money!"
13910,1,"I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that. But, once on, they are the most moldable, soft, well fitting and supportive sandals I have. I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily. Another complaint is that they are so hard to find! I have several pairs and will keep looking..."
91223,1,I love these shoes! They are cute and extremely comfortable. They were featured in some great shoes on The Today Show on 7/11/07. The price was listed higher than I paid for them here!
82888,1,Recently went on vacation and walked all day long on these flip flops without getting leg fatigue or foot pain.
119000,2,The water shoes wore blisters on my daughter's heels after the first wear. No thanks!
348002,1,Great price and free shipping for Speery Top Sider Boat Shoe.The price was cheaper than any retail outlet with a large selection of colors. I highly recommend using Amazon for future shoe buys.
378347,1,"I stand on my feet all day always looking for comfy shoes especially if they are cute,heel height perfect,could dance hrs in these,but will be wearing them to church and when I want to dress up,heel fits snug in a good way,love em,proab get another color since cute comfy shoes hard to find,yay."
112960,1,"I've been buying Rockport shoes for about 15 years now. They're one of a few that have extra wide widths available (I wear an 11.5, W). They're very comfortable and long wearing. I use them for my everyday work shoes (office environment). Buying on line is great so that I don't have to go to a dozen local shoe stores looking for them. They're a little slippery on wet tile floors but grip well overall.Paid $58.90 and shipping was free. Purchased on 07-31-2009 directly from Amazon."
142155,0,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not &#34;tall&#34; enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
176778,1,"These are good shoes that will save your feet lots of trouble. They will accommodate inserts such as orthotics if you need to use them. They do not, as the copywriter suggests, ""feel like going barefoot"" -- they are a bit warm in summer as closed leather shoes tend to be. They are well made and give your foot plenty of support where it is needed. You'll notice they mostly come in colors suitable for nurses, but I am not a nurse, so I wear the black ones and sometimes children see my feet in bathroom stalls and think a man is there! What I'm trying to say is, while these shoes look quite respectable, they are not very feminine. However, if you get foot problems from less structured shoes as I did, these are great."
172680,1,"great fit for my size 13 dogs, and they look pretty cool. the stitching is slightly dorky, but it does add a little texture. that's the only reason it doesn't get a 5 out of 5. we'll see how they perform on the court."
59010,1,shipped fast ordered around christmas at the last minute and were brand new as listed size was right have held up great
29950,1,"Got the shoes one week ago, I found that the shoes are very good for running, as it's pretty springy. But not very good for walking, with the narrow bottom. It is also pretty airy inside, perfect for my sweaty feet."
128284,1,"These are great daily wear shoes, goes nicely with both casual and formal wear. Very well made and comfortable Fit & finish is consistent, leather is smooth.Quality and comfort wise these are better than Bostonian's & Rockport's and just a notch below johnston murphy.Couple of minor things though I had to replace factory shoe inserts with after market ones (Dr scholls) because factory one's doesn't have much arch support. Another inconvenience is that right shoe squeals, hopefully that will be fine after wearing few more times."
113116,1,My daughter was so thrilled to receive these wonderful shoes for christmas this year. They were different and that is why she liked them. They came in perfect shape and I couldn't ask for it to have been a better experience. Thank you so much!
268997,1,I am very pleased with this Rockport shoe. It is difficult to find a comfortable shoe in a size 15. This one is a winner. Delivery was prompt. Thank you Amazon.
274434,1,"I was interested in getting a good pair of boots at a great price. I received a great pair of boots at a great price! I use my boots both for hiking and as winter boots. Comfortable, durable and very waterproof, these boots were more than I expected. I nearly bought boots that cost nearly twice as much because of the name. I'm certainly glad I reconsider! Hi-tec boots a great buy. Boots come waterproof but I added mink oil for extra protection and easier clean off!"
167077,1,"I have been chasing grouse, pheasant and quail (when we used to have them) all over Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and South Dakota for 30 years. I have had numerous boots over the years, Red Wing, Cabela's Kangaroo, Rocky, Irish Setter,etc. I have had some good ones but nothing compares to this Danner boot. I wanted something that wouldn't take long to break in and I preferred something made in America. I got both with this boot. They felt like a 10 year old boot the first time I wore them .... that's a good thing. Pretty pricey but I don't jack around when it comes to my feet."
296276,1,"This has been a difficult winter of ice and snow here in rural Connecticut and for older persons such as myself whose balance is not always the best, and for whom falling is no fun, these are a godsend. You can walk on ice and snow just like they were nornal surfaces. The flip side is don't wear them inside. Walking on a smooth floor in Yak Trax is like walking on ice without Yak Trax. They may seem a bit had to put on at first, but with experience is easier than putting on rubbers. They can eventually wear out or break, but that is the nature of elasticized materials. The walkers are good for normal use in ice and snow, but probably serious hikers would have to upgrade to a higher level model."
336586,0,"I bought these shoes on 11.5 (not only for the excelent price, I do like Florsheim).To my regret they were smaller than they should be (number 11 equivalent perhaps?). Honestly I did not even try to change it, that's the reason I gave it 3 stars.The look is OK, but due the above mentioned reason I couldn't use them nor ""test them"" on the field."
54653,0,"Bought white Keds for my daughter. She loves them, but after just 4 weeks they are showing structural wear and tear. They were only $20, so not over the top expensive, but I remember when Keds lasted for multiple seasons so I guess I am nostalgic..."
19095,1,i got these boots last year and i ride in all temps my feet are always warm they are holding up great i am planing to buy more work america products
69771,1,"purchased these shoes a couple of weeks on amazon for $30. everywhere else they were above $50. cool looking, sporty, and low profile. Very comfy and good alternative to the Samba by Adidas or Puma. love 'em!"
19595,1,"Great fitting shoes with a lot of comfort built in. They look good with jeans, khakis, and any other slacks. Wore them all day yesterday for the first time and were comfortable all day long. Good solid walking shoe."
241027,0,Mootsies Tootsies have always been my favorite. Have been wearing them for years. BUT the last pair I got ( which was ordered on Amazon) came apart after wearing them only a few times. Had to take them to a shoe repair to get them fixed. But now they are o k. Don't know if I will try again or not. Have to think about it.
207265,1,"These shoes are super cute and run on the comfortable end. My only concern was that they run small, as in really small. I normally wear a 7.5 and had to return them to get an 8 but the 8s are also small. My suggestion would be to go a full size up.Other than that, they're the perfect casual sandal."
267008,1,"Bought as a gift for father who actually requested another pair of Hi-Tec boots for Christmas but after reading reviews regarding foot and ankle support selected the Altitude IV instead. Size fit great, color was dark chocolate and best of all was delivery... bought last minute before Christmas and was delivered to my house on Christmas Eve! Highly recommend for mountain hiking via my dad's comments."
270183,0,So far I have always been very satisfied with all my purchases from Amazon and this one is very good
113389,1,"These are the greatest shoes I have had in a long time. I have severe problems with my feet and now when I put these on my feet feel oh, so good. I had been searching for a very long time. Thank you Amazon.com"

63608,1,"This is the second pair of Altitude IV boots for me and I can't imagine a better hiking boot for my purposes. I hike hilly, wooded areas daily and wear these boots throughout the year. My previous pair lasted three years and the only problem is the lining of the heel wore out. They are now my work boots.They look good and lace up well. Break in is immediate. I don't walk in rivers, but waterproofing lasted a year before needing treatment. Their lightweight and durability amaze me. The only thing that concerns me is that Hi-Tec might stop making them by the time I need another pair."
368190,0,"This flip flop has a thick foam bottom, which makes it a little too ""chunky"" for my taste. Bought it so I could embellish the straps with beads, etc. Probably won't go through with that because the straps are taught when I have the flops on. Perhaps if I wear them in they'll get more comfortable."
173916,1,It was exactly what I wanted. I was glad to find them without having to hunt all over for them. I was happy to purchase them through Amazon.
384851,1,"Within 10 minutes of wearing my first pair, I knew I needed to buy them in every color/pair!! They are incredibly soft and comfortable to wear for hours. I have issues with my knee and have had no problem walking/standing in them all day. They cost a little bit more but are well worth the price! They are a little heavier than normal flip flops but I didn't notice it after an hour of wearing them."
140787,1,"I bought a pair of these Mary Jane's last year and managed to wear them out. I live in a large city and we walk everywhere, all over the streets and up and down stairs. These shoes have been a life saver. They wear and feel like sneakers, but look a little better when you don't want the full sneaker look. I must admit they are not the most attractive - a little clunky, but the comfort is worth it. They run true to size. I am even able to fit them with my store bought orthotics. In fact, I am going to buy another pair to keep as an extra, just in case they decide to discontinue them. When I bought them last year they were much more expensive.Great shoes. I highly recommend them."
116381,0,Sent it back because it made my feet look even bigger. Did not fit well either. The support was comfortable but did not like the look on me.
186840,1,"Repeat purchase of this particular sneaker. Great support, true to size, and wears for a long time. Propet makes an excellent product and Amazon with the prime account ships it to you fast with no fuss."
27389,1,"These are one of the most comfortable pairs of boots I've ever purchased. They are very forgiving when walking or standing in them for long periods. Considering they ""boots"" they are by no means heavy on your feet. I am very happy with my purchase!"
22775,1,I got these shoes for a wonderful price and I received them in a couple of days. Very easy with no hassles! Would definitely shop here again!

354353,0,"The shoe looks great and is very comfortable. You can feel the support right away as you slip them on. Even while standing and stretching, I can feel the bounce in the ""hole""ful sole. I've had these since October and I ran 10 to 20 miles a week since I've had them. They're still in good shape but in the past month or so (maybe at the 400 mile mark) my right heel has felt tender the day after a 3 to 4 mile run. My right knee also feels locked up as I finish up my run. I'm 6'0"" and 195-200 lbs and I may be pounding my feet a little harder than the normal runner. I primarily run applying the interval training method (sprint-jog-sprint-jog...) so that may have something to do with it. I've also heard that getting the right pair of socks is also very crucial to a runner's comfort, not just the shoes. Surprise, huh?I bought this shoe when it was still priced at a full $125. FinishLine was having a promotion which I took advantage of and got it for $85 including shipping otherwise I'm not a fan of overpaying for products that perform the same as its lower-priced competitors. I'm a bit of a sneaker connoisseur so I know my kicks somewhat. My friend's orthopedist uncle has actually cut down the middle of running sneakers of a handful of the better known brands and has found that adidas are functionally better than Nikes but so is New Balance, Aasics, and Sauconys. Nike's are just damn expensive because they need to pay for Lebron's ad campaigns. I'm very intrigued to start running in Aasics and Sauconys but once I make the switch, I'll be excited to wear the Megabounces as casual shoes that I can wear around town.Like I said, they still look great!"
289678,2,"I bought these from an eBay seller actually. They were advertised as being warm and comfortable. WHAT A JOKE! They don;t have a millimeter of insole, a MM of padding. Nothing. Its just a leather shell and thats it. Don't expect these to be anything as described. If you order a size 9 like I did, you get a shell thats about size 11. You have to wear 2 pairs of socks and have an insole. And they're real wide at the top. They look a litlte like clown shoes. A complete and total waste of time, money and effort. If I lived in an are that had real stores it wouldn't a problem. But shoe stores here in Pittsburgh have 1 pair each of smen's slippers. And they're usually that horrible moccasin thing. Gosh I've learned to hate them. So, I'm, stuck trying to find a decent pair on line. So far, no good. Don't buy slippers unless you can test them first."
116794,1,"I bought these shoes after years of trying to find a comfy, supportive substitute for sneakers. They didn't disappoint me. They fit well, construction is superb, I get the support I need, and I plan to purchase another pair soon."
61657,1,These Keds are hard to find anymore. They are the only shoe my diabetic mom can wear with comfort. She can go all day with these on and her feet are so sensitive.
174800,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
63362,0,Not as red as pictured. Overall I'm ok with the item but keep in mind that the colors are not as vibrant as pictured.
375271,1,This is a wonderful shoe. I have always had trouble getting comfortable shoes but I really think these are great. The product description exactly matched what I received. The velcrose straps are perfect - I have had a lot of trouble in the past finding shoes with velcrose straps. I have undergone 3 spine surgeries and needed something comfortable that was easy to put on and do up. The shoes arrived in a timely manner and were clean and new. I have to do a lot of walking and have found these shoes to be the best I have experienced. I will definately purchase these again. Thanks for a great shoe!
47388,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
268357,1,These are one of the most comfortable dress shoes I have ever worn. I normally wear tennis shoes being a nurse and so I know what is comfortable. I bought these softspots after buying two pairs of shoes that were just so uncomfortable and produced blisters. Now I am not going to dread wearing dress shoes and now make them my go to shoes.SoftSpots Women's Stephanie Pumps
62507,1,"The quality and the outlook is good, but it's kind of longer at the tip of the shoes and make it loose when I walk."
61728,0,"I had read that Keds was going back to its original quality rubber sole, but these have the same thin flappy soles that Keds have had for the last few years. The upper is also somewhat thin and scratchy, not like the original quality. I won't be fooled again."
80468,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
268248,1,"I love this shoe.. I have travelled the urban world in them , many miles logged on them and they still feel great... great buy..."
21428,2,I didn't like the quality of these boots at all they were not made out of leather but what almost appears to be plastic or something of that nature. I expected allot better quality boots for what they claimed to have been worth.I saw boots for 15.00 at walmart as good as these.
53758,1,"So far, good for my daughter. Comfort on the feet, no issues, just love the Endless Style, like other brand name shoes for women. She's enjoying them. Happy Holidays."
11134,0,"I bought these slippers as a Christmas present for my sister. I was really disappointed in the condition that the slippers arrived in. The box was so crushed either from insufficient packaging protection during shipping or they were plucked from inventory in that condition. In either case, I couldn't wrap the box and had to throw the slippers in a gift bag. Since Capezio is a good brand for ballet slippers, it would have been nice to have given her the gift in the box."
355140,1,The shoes have a very fresh look but they are so hard to clean being that there white definetly not your every day pair of shoes.
39469,1,"My wife's last pair like this lasted 12 years and finally got a hole in the sole. So she wanted to replace them. The ""purple"" color is actually a little more fusia/pink but she still loves them!"
238549,1,A very nice THIN wallet just about perfect for my back pocket. I purchased the slim slimmy one as well but this one is far Superior. It has pockets for the most used cards providing easy access and a pocket for those not use often. A clear ID pocket and a simple cash pocket in a neat clean package. I highly recommend this wallet for those who like a thin wallet.
154378,1,"My husband says these are the most comfortable walking shoes he's ever owned! In fact, this is his second pair."
96345,1,"One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've owned. I have about five pairs of Sketcher's in my closet and I always seem to end up with these on my feet. I went back and bought the tan version, because they ran out of my size in black."
249406,0,"these appear to be identical to another pair I bought from this company however this has zippers which can make it easier to take on and off. I'm not sure why but it says these are calf boots when they are the same length as knee high boots? is there a difference between the two? I thought calf boots came to the calf and knee boots came up to the knee. not much I can do about it now. and some thing else, it says leather but its a weird type of leather almost like leather you'd find on black sketchers or something. and that leather over time, bubbles up and tears off like plastics, not tradition combat leather, i.e. service boots. wonder how long these will last, time will tell I guess."
243609,1,"very good purchase for my daughter, she had a pair before and she wouldn't take them off unless she went to sleep so they worn out in almost 3 years, so i got this new pair for her for xmas, i'm sure she's gonna love them.perfect sizing and quality."
357695,0,"I ordered a size larger as recommended and it turned out to be too large for me. Half a size larger would have been better. The shoes feel comfortable, except that the sole of the shoes feels slippery. I was afraid I would slip and fall, so I returned the shoes."
167184,1,I have about 4 pair currently in different colors. I've had foot surgery and have had a hard time finding a comfortable shoe. It is good for walking and I took them on a cruise last year. My feet never hurt with all the walking I did. Try them and you will be happy - and so will your feet.Easy Spirit Women's Traveltime Mule
115144,1,"Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine since 2002 I dont skate so much but I love the style, this shoes was a little bit bigger but it's ok..good choise VANS OLD SCHOOL"
380010,0,"I purchased these shoes a half size larger than I normally wear and found them still very tight. Toe area is quite narrow. Otherwise, well made and good height for dancing."
232433,1,I am very pleased with these shoes. Only wish I could get them in white also. If available let me know
251189,1,love them nice price The price was right and the shoe is great I wear them as a house shoe ...
5807,1,"I got this pair of Easy Spirit shoes to replace my previous pair of Easy Spirit lace-ups, which had been my favorite pair of casual shoes for the past 15-20 years (I know, hard to believe they lasted that long - Easy Spirit is a great brand!). My new brown leather lace-ups are well-made, stylish, and very comfortable. If you're looking for sharp-looking shoes that are easy on the feet for long periods of wear, I'd say go for these!"
80140,1,"I have to say I got my Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Custom Red with Santa men's 11 shoes in three days. Very fast service and the shoes were really nice. They were a good fit, I ordered a half size larger then what I wear because I wear a heavy sock and needed the extra room. I told some of my other Santa friends about these and they each got a pair too. We all wore them at our Santa school in Santa Claus, Indiana and were they ever a big hit with the other Santa's. Everything was sent as described and I will buy from again."
82453,1,"Definitely try on sizes before buying to get your proper size. I usually take an 8-8 1/2 in shoes/sandals, but in these, I take a 9 regular. I got these in the 8 wide, and although there is plenty of width & toe room, the heel was alittle too wide (sloppy, not ""form-fitting"") as I have a narrow heel. But, overall, the comfort-factor is FABULOUS & I am big into getting the most comfortable shoe/sandal I can find. You will get that in these sandals & the bonus is that they LOOK GOOD too! Although they may be pricey, the comfort, resoleability & durability more than makes up for it."
205617,1,"The shoes fits well. I've worn them nearly everyday for the past two years and they still perform well. The tread is showing slight wear at the edges. When I first wore them I noticed a strange clicking or squeaking sound in the left shoe as I walked. At first I thought there was a pebble stuck somewhere so I removed all the debris but the noise was still there. There might have been a defect in the construction.Despite the sound I like wearing these shoes. They are durable, not too heavy, and have an aesthetically pleasing design."
334967,1,NB is the only sneaker I will buy. Love the look of this one and it is very confortable. Great colors too.
65209,1,"The quality and the outlook is good, but it's kind of longer at the tip of the shoes and make it loose when I walk."
254461,1,"I purchased this shoe for my 2 year old daughter. It is extra cute and extra durable. Best of all, I didn't even have to leave my home to get them! I am officially an amazon junkie!"
177826,0,"I keep buying puma since I like their design and laceless models. I only wish these shoes lasted longer. I have around 6 weeks with them and the cloth sewing that covers the plastic structure around the ankle has been disintegrating. I calculate a product life of 6 months.As always, delivery and purchase experience was excellent."
201408,1,I ordered these as bridesmaid bags for my upcoming wedding they are the perfect size and very durable material.The cost was perfect too given I have 5 bridesmaids. Doesn't sit flat without anything in it but that is ok.
365360,1,I love these shoes! I didn't have too wait long. My hubby wants some too =)
354145,2,The tongue has a piece of metal in it that presses down on your foot - really hurts after a while. The heel part made me bleed through my socks - I needed to line the whole inside with a silicone lining. Who wants to doctor shoes that much???!!!
301523,1,"Have been very happy with these shoes and haveordered them many times over the years.. The quality, as in everything it seems,is not as high as it once was, but still very good."
121334,1,"My sister always wore clogs like these and I thought they looked clunky. Then I saw more and more people wearing them. Finally someone said, ""get these if you take up boating, so the water can drain right out."" So I got some, even though we don't have a boat yet.I wear them around while gardening and park them by the back door when I come in. I don't have to worry about them getting wet.They are incredibly cushy and comfortable for walking. I don't even feel the gravel underfoot as I walk to the mailbox. The toe area is roomy enough for my wide foot and that's always been a struggle to find extra wide shoes to fit. They don't slip around.For me, the part that comes up over the arch of the foot could be cut a little more open. I have a high arch though, and it rubs a little there.They really are lightweight, so you don't feel like a clodhopper in them. Convenient to slip on and I'm really glad I finally gave in and got a pair.These are softer than Crocs and don't have the rigid bumps inside. I much prefer Sloggers."
23928,1,"The quality of these sandals are absolutely amazing. I wore them almost every day in the spring, summer, and fall for 3 years in all kinds of environments from the mall to the trails. During the winter, I wore them around the house and even occasionally outside on a quick run to the mailbox. About 10 months ago, I deployed to Iraq for 6-months and took them with me for going between my living quarters to the shower (everyday) over dusty, rocky, dirt areas... and they held up perfectly. After I returned, I kept on wearing them. I cannot express in words how good these Sandals are.They did eventually breakdown some (but no where near as fast as other sandals) and I ordered a second pair of these sandals from Amazon, which were just like my first.Other nice touches to this product include: the beer bottle opener built into the sole and the air cushion support which really helped my feet (I have high arches).This is a GOOD investment in footwear and I'd highly recommend these sandals to anyone who doesn't want to buy new sandals every year. I hope you buy them and enjoy... note that they will have a small break-in period."
185043,0,"bought them last year. sometimes he complains that they are too warm. i think the rubber on the bottom makes too much noise on my hardwood floors, then again, mine are suede bottoms. slick enough to practice tango in, thats a plus. he steps on the backs of them so i think they run small. they've been in the wash a few times and no wear and tear so far."
333023,2,"I bought these for a halloween costume, and even though I selected standard shipping, the cost didn't show up on the balance until I got the confirmation and the order had gone through--shipping cost as much as the shoes I thought I was getting at a discount!Also, though I used the conversion chart to get a women's size, they ended up being too small."
45638,1,"This is the sixth pair of Superstars I have purchased, and I probably will never purchase another brand or style. The arch support is phenomonal, which is surprising for a shoe that looks so flat. I wear them for both work and play and my feet are never disappointed, not to mention they are totally adorable in every color."
204205,1,"The Danner Super Rainforest boots are the longest lasting work boot I've ever owned. I'm a contractor that wears these boots over 200 days per year, and for the past 10 years these are my boot of choice. They can stand up to the rigors of contruction, and double as a good hunting boot. I normally get 3 yrs. wear out of a pair. I highly recommend them to anyone who wants a boot that won't fall apart under the pressures of the jobsite"
148486,1,"These socks are for shoe size 12.5-5. My son is a size 5. I bought these for him for soccer. I think they will fit for another year, even if his foot grows. Currently, they fit over his shin guards and fold over below the knee about 2.5"". If he grows, the fold will be smaller, but that's OK. I love how these came in a huge variety of colors, so I could get the color that matches the league jerseys. My son said, ""They're fuzzy. I like that,"" when he put them on for the first time. I don't think they're fuzzier than other athletic socks, so I'm not sure what he meant. But, he's happy, so I'm happy. These are a great price for 3 pairs!"
265536,1,"Worked out of the box, used them for a few days on the treadmill, but probably wasnt needed. I have been using them for the weekly Treks here at Mission Peaks in the Bay Area, CA, which has pretty good uphills. No complains so far.Rated 4 only for the fact that the heels could use a little more padding - the heel of the shoe is hard which is good for support but not too good when you are walking up-slope. Also have been wearing 2 socks for better grip and to provide more cushion for the heels."
116111,1,Get about 1/2 size bigger than the actual shoe size. Quite comfortable. Got it for my 5 year old cousin and she loved it.
230441,1,"This boot has just the right amount of arch support (I have a ""normal"" arch), are ""Made in America"" and the heel is just the right height. Normally I wear a 11.5 D, but I chose an EE in 11.5 because it gave extra toe room and the heel still felt real good, but to snug up the heel just a bit more I put in some inexpensive ""heel cups"" now the heel fits like a D width but I have the toe room of an EE and it's like having the best of both worlds. When walking in them the feeling is one of stability and comfort with little lateral movement. While these are considered a work boot I plan to wear them around town for ""casual"" affairs they are that comfortable and good looking.Before I bought these I really thought I was going to get the Chippewa Arroyo Packer but the arch support was too high and the heel is another 1/4"" higher than the Double H and that combination made it feel like I was walking on my toes plus pushing against my arches.Never owned Double H or a packer, but I would certainley buy these again! ""Made in America"" was a big selling point for me here and the leather is very high quality and so are the ICE soles and stitching. Since I will not be wearing them for work I imagine they will last 20 years based on some of my other footwear performance made with similar quality materials.I purchased mine at Sheplers in Mesa, AZ (even though their web site does not even list the boot), they had a good price at $190 and I also had a 25% off a single item coupon so I only paid $142.50 plus tax."
136265,1,The Converse All-Star is a great looking shoe. The only problem is that they run big in size. Ex. If you wear a men's 10 1/2 you probably should order a 9 1/2 or 10. Otherwise you might feel like you're wearing clown shoes.
178707,1,"This was a very good buy. The price was right, they're comfortable and well made. I can't think of anything bad to say about them."
177141,1,"The best shoes ever, but if you use coverse.com to buy your shoes prepair for the SLOWEST loading site you have ever experienced! Many times I didn't buy shoes because of the speed of their site. I have really fast internet and their site is by far the slowest of any site I use. If you have the patients you can't beat the shoes (I always use the create your own) I have created some really unique shoes."
21031,1,got this for my BF and he really likes it. It is nicer quality than all the other boots he has. Although he did buy the uggs (one with lining)which I assume he will wear for the winter. It's sexy without being too flashy. It's classy with a touch of edge. Looks great with a good polish and perfect for fancy jeans.
24156,1,"I have received so many compliments on this shoe, especially when wearing it with Jeans and Colored shirt at work. Pefect shoe for Business Casual., comfortable and stylish."
119485,1,Package arrived on time and in excellent condition. Would gladly do business with seller in the future.
311855,1,"Yes, a great running shoe at a great price. The shoes are fabulous looking and fitting. True to size and so comfy! I love running and I love these shoes!"
63321,1,"These are great run around shoes and camping. Light weight so you'renot logged down on short hikes. Don.t show dirt and i,ve washd them in the past. I wear 8.5 N andthese shoes fit pefectly. Nice navy lighter than shown but not toolight. Avazoncame through again for me. Jakjaneus"
238899,2,"This is a well made, but poorly designed shoe tree.You can't get it out of the shoe because the hand hold to remove it pushes the heel into the shoe harder instead or releasing the pressure. This makes it impossible to remove. I ended-up putting a knob on the top that I can push in the right direction to compress the shoe tree and remove it."
185644,1,My very favorite shoe. I have Morton's Neuroma and this fits so well. Have never had to return the items.
218424,1,THE SHOES WERE A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAD. HE IS OLD SKOOL TO SAY THE LEAST. THE SHOES WERE LIKE PEOPLE BUYING THROWBACK JERSEYS. HE HAS NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SHOES. TRUST ME THE SHOES HAVE GOT TO BE COMFORTABLE OR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RETUTNED INSTANTLY.
252923,1,"great shoes..i'm not happy it made in vietnam, but i still love my beeswax anyway..i'm so glad that i have it now.."
274378,1,"This is my second pair of this Hi Tec boot. The first pair lasted a very long time and was very comfortable the whole time. They break in right away. For years I was a die hard Danner buyer and I can say these beat my last pair of over priced Danner hikers hands down. (really they were more sneaker than hiker -I still love my Danner steel toes for a work boot) But my favorite thing about these Hi Tec boots are the eyes and hooks -THEY ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER OWNED. The laces last forever because the eyes and hooks are so smooth and rounded. Like I said, just bought my second pair -five star goodness."
154767,1,"Bought these, because I liked the unusual blend of blue and cream and love Softwalk shoes. Then I wasn't sure I liked them after they arrived, because they are so unusual. Well, I started wearing them, and they are super comfortable. Not only that, but I get lots of compliments about how nice they look with pants and jeans. People really think they're boots. The tread on the bottom helps with walking in snow and ice. They are warm and comfy, even with the heel. I usually wear size 8 1/2, but softwalks often run a little shorter for me. Because of all the padding, I opted for a size 9. and it seems to fit well. I might have been able to wear 8 1/2, but the toe area may have been a little too snug then."
245535,1,These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and are very durable as well. As I write this review I am ordering my third pair to replace the ones I have been wearing for the last 14+ months.The ONLY reason I am not giving them 5 stars is due to the quality of the laces. The laces that come with them simply do not last as long as I would like.Might not be the fault of the laces though - the shoes are so durable they might just be outlasting what most laces are capable of.
365632,1,"I love these shoes. Durable, dependable, flexible. I use a different pair for winter weather but for every other season converses always fit."
57693,1,"These are cute, they stay tied, and there's just enough slip to use these babies on a dance floor without having to spring for full suede bottoms. They also hold up well when you throw them into a huge dance bag and accidentally crush them in the trunk of your car."
194529,1,"These are really Great boots,............ I would recommend these for any growing boy, or girl,............ Just buy a half size larger!!!!!!"
150782,2,"I like the concept of this wallet. It seems to have a place for everything I needed. However, the bag is very soft and I wanted something with a more solid construction. I would also have liked the credit card compartment to open fully for easier access which it did not. So, reluctantly, I returned the bag and will continue my search for the perfect wallet."
242083,1,"great sneakers! look great and fit perfectly. can wear with anything!the best for skydiving :)will definitely buy again, maybe different colors.thank you."
223195,0,"This is faux chincilla and it runs small. I wear a 9.5 and I have turned it into a mule just by wearing it, so I would order a size up. Like the color and comfort. Good company-Footsmart."
134985,1,"It's a classy shoe that fits well and rides well too. I bought a pair four years ago and they are still holding up - although they're beat up, they've become my factory loafers - I can wear them anywhere. Remember, you may be paying twice as much as normal tassel loafers, but they are definitely twice the shoe. It's so comfortable."
118942,1,The butterfly is so cute! It's nice to have something distinguishing without having to get a crazy color. I use these shoes for powerlifting as well as everyday wear. I visited the seller's website and they have a pretty large variety of designs. Would like to see some in kids' sizes but I couldn't be happier with my new Chucks!
118857,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
342568,1,These are awsome. just like shown. shipping took a while but it was over christmas so it makes sense. Just as nice as the pictures showed! Love the new CHucks
166473,1,"i gotta say, these are the best shoes i have ever been lucky enough to find. when i wear 'em it's almost like they're not there. they're still very comfortable but it's a very light shoe which is what i wanted. worth every penny, i say"
150124,1,"The seller sent out the shoes in perfect timing. The only drawback is that they, from my son's perspective, do not let him jump so high -- like in the commercials for the Super Ball shoe. I knew that wouldn't happen, but try explaining that to a strong-willed 4 yr old! I really like these shoes. They have a great fit, are very well made (as all Stride Rite's are), and the Velcro is easy for him to use. I have finally found a shoe that will oust him from his rain boots with no battle. He is actually wearing these more often than his rain boots!"
337566,1,It took a long time to find the best walking shoe. This is it. You put them on and there is no breaking them in. Comfortable from the first step. Highly recommend!
184471,0,The boots are very pretty. The Size is also proper. But there is a scratch in of the boots.
75213,2,"Defective product, left shoe too tight and a bit short! I have had three other pairs of New Balance 574' s with out a problem."
342703,1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylors since the mid-80's but this is my first pair with a black outsole (all others have been the standard off white). I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth. If I had gone in shoes with an off white outsole, they would have been trashed. I also like the fact that these seem just a litle more ""dressy"" than most canvas Chuck Taylors. Highly recommended."
286395,1,Great shoes. Only gripe; the total shipping cost for my order to Australia cost more than the goods!
229620,1,"First off, as the name implies, these Adidas Sambas are classics. They've been around 40 years (probably more) and they still look fresh! In my shallowness, I bought them on looks alone for around-the-house/ casual-Friday's.They are a bit narrow, which is great for me. But they do lack a bit in arch/ball of the foot support. You'd think that if they're making these shoes for narrow-footed people, they would have better arch support because most people with narrow feet tend to have higher arches, right? If you have wide feet, you might want to avoid these.As for the extra-long tongue, I have to say that I kind of like it. It makes the shoes unique. But I think if you wore low-socks, the tongue might chafe you and look funny. Also, folding the tongue down looks kind of dumb as you can see part of the sizing tag.I found the sizing (10.5) to be pretty much right on, maybe a smidge bigger than my other Adidas. Overall though, for the price (I found mine on sale for $30!), I thought they were are a great deal! I really like these Samba Classics. They look fantastic and fit good for a casual shoe. I just wish they had a bit more support (like the Samba Millenium's do), then they'd be perfect."
145296,1,Well this is my 2nd pair of Uggs...But I paid ALOT MORE for my first pair which were the exact same boots but a different color and NOT from Amazon!I really appreciate Amazon for this exact reason...I get quality items for MUCH LESS...and thats all I can ask for! My boots are so comfy...I LOVE MY NEW UGGS!! Oh and I did get caught in the rain with them the other day...THEY LOOK AS GOOD AS NEW after they dried!! These boots are the most COMFORTABLE footwear I have EVER worn! I love them!
308772,1,"I love this shoe! When I saw the black and charcoal pair on sale for just $20.69, I couldn't believe my good fortune. I ordered them right away and look forward to wearing them on my raining walks this winter. My white pair, right out of the box, took a relaxing trip to Hawaii."
298580,1,"These shoes are really cute and mostly comfortable. A little rough place near one toe rubbed for a while, but isn't a problem now. The sole seems narrower than the shoe itself, so it presesnts a lean profile. I walk in these for fitness, and the vents provide good circulation, but there's lots of plastic in the top, so some folks might find them hot to wear. The fit is true to size. I have liked other Skechers better than these, but still will buy Skechers."
333178,1,"these boots are great! Buttery soft leather that has loosened up to fit me perfectly, and they make my big feet look small. Very comfy and well worth the price."
12567,1,"the shoes are great, they were in mint condition when i received them. i couldn't be happier"
14969,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
57111,1,a lot longer than i thought they would be. but a nine would be to small. but they are nice. just wish they weren't so long.
164613,1,Perfect! Just as described! I love my uggs. They are so warm and comfy I can't wait to order myself another pair in a different color. Uggs are totally worth the money.
234739,1,"This was the first time I ever purchased a pair of shoes on-line. I was initially looking at Hush Puppies, but they no longer have the styles that I remember when Hush Puppies were popular. Maybe that's why Hush Puppies are not as popular as they once were. At any rate I don't recall how I found Clark's but I'm glad I did. This shoe was just the style I was looking for. Great fit, very attractive shoe. I'm a happy camper. Or should I say happy walker?"
203921,1,Love these flip flops. They are so comfortable. This is my second pair. I wear them about everyday during the spring and summer. These and the Reef Lounger are awesome. You don't want to ever take them off.. They are a must for the summer!!!
3386,1,"I hike fairly frequently in the Sierra mountains, often in rocky, steep or muddy terrains. So I spent a good amount of time researching for the best pair of boots that will provide and comfort and durability for an all-day hike. I finally decided on these Altitude IV boots.I was very pleased with my decision, as they were very comfy, no blisters, and durable, not to mention better looking than other hiking boots. Good grip over rocks, mud and dirt trails. I will buy another pair of Altitude IV after these wear out."
288378,1,"A very elegant pair of shoes at a reasonable price. What really amazed me was the intact condition upon receipt. I must say that this is the first time I buy shoes online. No minor scars or damage...better than buying at the shoe store! The shoes come wrapped in protective material inside a very nice box, conserving the fresh leather smell and shine."
82002,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
23806,1,"This is my first purchase from this brand and honestly the most I have ever spent on a pair of flip flops. And I would do it again! They look fantastic, they have great support and the quality seems like they will last. The bottle opener on the bottom is a very nice touch and makes for great conversation at a bbq. One tiny downside is they originally felt a little to tight. As I have wore them quite a few times they have stretched a little and now feel better. I would say if you are back on forth between sizes go with the higher one, if your not, I don't know for sure that I would recommend going bigger. All around great purchase,"
126108,1,THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL SHOE. EVERYBODY NOTICED THEM WHEN I WORE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO MANY COMPLIMENTS. COMFORTABLE TOO. I STAYED IN THEM ALL DAY AND MY FEET NEVER GOT TIRED. A GREAT VALUE.
274819,1,I ordered these boots for a trip to Tasmania. They arrived before the due date and fitted beautifully. For the money these are very good value.
204637,1,"I love Reef flip flops. I have somewhat wide feet, and these fit great, and the cushy sole makes them really comfortable and act like they have some arch support. I can wear them for hours and walk long distances in them, with no trouble at all! Highly recommended. :)"
101186,1,I had worn out a pair of the original Croc thongs and loved them. This new version is comfortable with better grip than the old ones. Plus they are much more stylish!
331266,0,I am having to return this item. It does not fit the person I purchased it for.I'm sorry and I will never buy clothing items for anyone's Christmas again.
124845,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
92098,1,"I spend most of my days in the elements and at my age it gets harder every year to keep the extremities warm. I have looked at these boots for the last two years wondering if they would be what they have been presented to be. I can say that they are the best pair of boots I think I have ever had, my feet are warm, dry and comfortable. If anybody appreciates that I think you will be very pleased with them. The quality in m,y opinion would be very hard to beat."
35986,1,"This is my first pair of rubber overshoes. They protect my shoes, are easy to take on/off, and look okay. I wear a size 11 shoe and bought the XL which is a good fit. XL would fit a 12 or 13, but would definitely be too big for a 10."
146401,1,Always a great product. My other Uggs are 13 years old and still keep my feet warm. I do prefer the old style of Uggs over the new style.
270157,1,"These are Great shoes, I have been walking 3 1/2 mil. per day in them starting the first day out of the box!!"
364160,1,These shoes are great for the price. They are light and they let your feet breathe easily. Only con is there is no arch support so after wearing the for a while my feet hurt badly.
38078,1,This is my fourth pair. I love them from the time I get them and miss them when they must go. Confort all year-round. Good quality.
135483,1,"Shipping was way fast, this is my 5th pair of Chucks the black on black is slick, they breath better than any other shoe ive ever owned and it definitely wont be my last pair."
220871,0,"Recently bought a pair of the Marco Oxford Bostonians at a great price from Amazon and received the package early. The shoes fit well, but I'm disappointed with the quality. My first 3 Bostonians were made in Italy, but this one was made in India. I could tell the difference in the quality - the leather is dull, the stitching unrefined, the make and look are not quite the same as my old pairs. I read from other reviews that some of the recent purchases were made in India, but I gambled. Hope that they last as long as my old ones."
131425,1,Received my Reefs today and they needed no breaking in. I was a little worried that I would have to wear them for a while before they became as comfortable as my other pair which I have owned for four years and refused to get of. Shipping was extremely fast. Very satisfied with my purchase.
281752,1,"My knees were killing me and my toes were ate up with blisters and black toenails (gross I know, but you long distance runners know what I mean). My shoe guy put me in this shoe and voila, no more blisters and no more sore knees (well, it wasn't quite voila as my knees took a little while to adjust to the change in mechanics and heal up and the toes are still healing, but it was plenty quick for all that). Anyway, I'm in heaven. I didn't realize I was an overpronater, well I thought I was, but didn't realize how much a shoe could help. Also, these shoes are a little small (as are all running shoes) so size up a little to avoid the toes thing. I've run 3 half marathons and 2 marathons in these in less than two months. Hurray for no more sore knees. The 15 miler and half marathon right before that in the old shoes were terrible. I've saved those old ones for short trail runs in the mud. Btw, my shoe guy recommended inserts for these as he says the ones that come with the shoe wear out really quick."
156670,0,"The shoes are good to look at. But it is a little bit uncomfortable to walk. you feel as if you are wearing a large shoe even though it is light in weight. it has nice cushions, however your toe nails start hurting after walking for a long time. If you are buying it for everday use, its a bad idea but good for occasional uses. Personally, I would prefer something more comfortable."
355238,0,I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.
306487,1,My daughter's love these boots so much we bought this pair for their cousin. They aren't the sturdiest boots but really cute and fun to wear.
343869,1,"After seeing the popularity of this shoe, I decided to test it out myself and I am impressed. Although its not too comfortable, they hug your feet and don't slip off even when loose, which is exactly what I was aiming for."
191997,1,This is my 2nd pair of theses Vagabond Sanuk's ...My first pair lasted a full 12-month of wearing them almost everyday. I think that is proof of a well made shoe. I wear them in almost ever situation. They are even classy enough to wear to a wedding or funeral. You can wear them with socks or without. Only down-side is in really wet situations they may loose grip somewhat.
260901,1,"These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy."
377594,1,These boots are so cute on my daughter. The suede is so soft and they look like a million bucks on her. Great boots!
381149,1,"We've have been wearing this line of Sambas since they come out (over ten years ago). A good shoe for indoor soccer, and for just wearing around."
318784,1,"I am always looking for comfortable shoes. As I get older, regular dress shoes can be hard on my legs if I have to be on my feet for awhile. I have bought a lot of Rockport shoes and I like them for their style and comfort. Years ago I bought Hush Puppies and I stilll own a brown pair. I bought these shoes because of their color (I wanted a white shoe for the summer) and because I like/enjoy my other pair of Hush Puppies. For their comfort, color and style, these are excellent."
133156,1,"My favorite dress shoes have always been made by Cole Haan. However, I was looking for a more reasonable alternative that looked great. I purchased a pair of these shoes in brown and loved them so I turned around and bought a second pair in black. These shoes can be worn with a suit or casually. Amazon has a great price on these and I have seen these for as much as 3 times this price on other websites. It is hard to get italian made shoes for under $100. To be fair, I have only had these a month so I do not know about the long term durability but so far so good. I have received many compliments on these.They tend to run a little large. So I would order about a half size smaller than your normal size. Also, the shoe inserts come out so you can add a custom insert if you like."
86611,1,"Bought these for weight lifting, but find myself wearing them everywhere. What's not to love about a pair of Chucks? An American classic."
57875,1,These Keds are hard to find anymore. They are the only shoe my diabetic mom can wear with comfort. She can go all day with these on and her feet are so sensitive.
46995,1,"Simply a handsom well made pair of boots. They are are rugged yet elegant at the same time. I wear them with jeans or slacks and get compliments all the time. They are a bit difficult to slip on the first few times because of the harness, but once they're boken in, they are very comfortable."
350072,1,"I really do like this shoe! I own several pair of Nine West shoes and they always fit true to size and this shoe was no exception. I love the platform paired with the stiletto heel. I also thought the shape of the toe was really cute. I did feel like the toe area was a little narrow, but I have a wider foot. It was not extremely uncomfortable and is something that I hope with clear up once the shoe is broken in. Overall I think this is a very sexy, fairly comfortable shoe and I am pleased with my purchase."
265329,1,These boots are extremely comfortable and very waterproof. I use them for powerwasher and stay dry and comfortable even though I am on my feet for many hours.
115728,1,"I buy it for a gift and the person who reseved it is very happy, they was in time and very good packing."
379573,1,"My daughter was required to get these shoes for her high school drama program. We never imagined that they would be so comfortable. She now wears them to ballroom dancing lessons and will use them in any stage presentation she takes part in. I would highly remcommend these shoes to anyone who is involved in theater. They are comfortable, and provide a stable base for movements that increases safety and confidence."
283873,1,"I have 4 pairs of these Clarks sandals in different colors and the soles of my blue ones finally wore out. I found these on Amazon.com and immediately bought them. They are a couple of shades darker than my blue ones but just as comfortable and will go with the blue items in my wardrobe. This shoe style has been around for many years. I would have to travel a distance to a Clark's store and then there is no guarantee they would have the shoe and in the color I was looking for. When I saw them on Amazon.com, I quickly purchased them and they arrived a few days later. They are extremely comfortable and completely adjustable because of the 3 straps with buckles."
358996,1,The crocs are fine the only thing is I ordered them in black and when they got here they were brown.
323095,1,"I knew I'd made the right choice the minute I put them on. They feel like shoes made by craftsmen. Within seconds I was climbing higher on the boulder than I wanted to go-- that's how much difference they made (o.k-- I'm comparing them to climbing in running shoes!) The other point worth making is that my feet stayed comfortable while climbing.Maybe the most telling comment I can make is this one. I ran into another climber with the same shoes. When I asked him if he liked them, his face lit up. And then all the other climbers (all wearing other brands) joined in the conversation-- everyone agreed that La Sportiva Mythos was the best."
240325,1,"So far, good for my daughter. Comfort on the feet, no issues, just love the Endless Style, like other brand name shoes for women. She's enjoying them. Happy Holidays."
215829,1,"I've always loved Dr. Scholl's Exercise Sandals. I haven't worn them in quite a while, so after receiving this pair, I put them on and wore them all day long. They REALLY do exercise your legs and buns! My lower body was SORE the next day, just as if I'd gone to the gym the day before!"
298005,1,"I where these to work and casual events whenever I can because I like them so much. The bottoms get dirty pretty quickly but the leather still looks good. Also, if you have flat feet you might want to use insoles."
263545,1,"These are great shoes. Very good for soccer, but also good for an all-around tennis shoe. I wear them everywhere."
290932,1,"I needed a pair of stylish, comfortable, and affordable brown dress shoes to wear for my 20 year high school reunion. These shoes definitely fit the bill. I danced the WHOLE NIGHT in them. I definitely recommend these Rockport shoes. I felt dressed to impress and very comfortable. Coming from someone who suffers from foot ailments, this is a strong endorsement."
324438,1,"I'm back here ordering a pair of these Acorn slippers to replace a pair I've had for close to 10 years. Yes, they last that long! These are the warmest and most comfortable slippers I've ever owned in my life. They were given to me as a Christmas present one year as a joke since my husband always bought me slippers or slipper socks for the holiday. Turns out the joke was on him because I had never known such warmth during the winter months with these slippers and I absolutely love them. I thought for sure I'd never be able to replace them & happened to find them here at Amazon! YAY. Can't wait to get my new pair."
341525,1,I have a long history with Easy Spirit shoes but I had never seen the patterned shoes before. I was looking for a light colored shoe that wouldn't attract all the dirty smudges. This is the shoe! I've had so many compliments - so glad I made this purchase!
165892,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
13872,1,"I love this shoe. It's dressy, but casual enough for every day summer wear, and it's comfortable for walking around every day. I bought one years ago at a retail store, then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and couldn't find anything else that came close. I found these here, and ordered the same ones I had before, and am very happy about it. Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6!"
277013,1,"Not a bad boot, but needs a substantial break in period. Bought it in the wide width, but it would be nic if wide were a bit wider."
307749,1,"I was debating whether I wanted to buy a pair online or just go into a store and buy them there. Boy am I glad I went to go buy them in person... as other people have mentioned, Converse run a little big so a size 11 (which I am) is really a 9 or so. I ended up getting an 8/5 and I haven't worn 8/5 size shoes since I was 13. You really want to go and buy them in person and completely avoid this problem."
176636,1,"Compared to my last pair of boots, Chippewa's, which I loved too, these Carolinas are great, every bit as comfortable as the Chippewa's and the Copper CrazyHorse leather, while probably not quite as tough as black, is gorgeous, the nicest looking boots I've ever had the pleasure of wearing."
24949,1,"great shoes for exercise, really let the feet breath, just a little peaved I had to pay duty/tax since I am in canada. 5 stars on the shoes, and 0 stars for east bay..."
109888,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
195167,1,I've ordered the black color last year and there were perfect.I also recently order the another pair brown color and noticed a little difference in quality. I was surprised when discovered that black one is made in BRAZIL but brown one is made in CHINA. Strange.......
175701,1,"I have another pair of these shoes and loved them; therefore, I purchased the pair through Amazon at a good price."
269769,1,My Dad has very flat and painful feet. He has had quite a few surgeries on his feet. He says these shoes are so comfortable they are like slippers. That is high praise from him. At 87 comfort is very important to him. I highly recommend these shoes.
245040,1,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E9DPE0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI just placed my 4th order of these sandals. I wear them all summer in Mi and then I go to Texas and AZ for the winter months and wear them every day down there. I wear them daily and when the soles start showing wear, I order new ones. They are comfortable and fit and wear excellent.I wear the old ones in the yard and garden."
165180,1,I purchased these boots for my niece and she really love them. They seem so nice and cozy. I plan on buying myself some now.
239994,1,These sneakers are very comfortable and I am very pleased with the look and price. I would highly recommend for a casual flat everyday shoe.
242757,1,Great product!I'll highly recommend.My only comment: it has not the inside flower design as shown in the photo
342666,0,"For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration."
344697,1,These were comfortable right out of the box. I had dress shoes and casual shoes and I needed a nice in between. These fit that perfectly. Still not convinced? The most interesting man in the world wears these.
145790,1,"Great value and comfort. In fact, this is the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned. I will definitely purchase more prophet shoes. I have wide feet so I ordered EE width. I've never been more comfortable. Thank you Prophet!"
134988,1,"I purchased a pair of these shoes a few years ago and due to having another pair, I waited to wear them. At first I though they were too narrow but once I put them on, I fell in love with these shoes. I have had many pair of pinch tassled shoes over the past 30 years and next to the old Hanover brand, these are the best ever. I certainly hope I can get many years out of these as they are not the cheapest on the block but by far the best this shoes wearer has ever had."
353458,1,I purchased these for my fiance for Christmas. I received them much earlier than I expected. He absolutely loved them. He said they are the most comfortable boots he owns and they fit like a glove.
102838,1,"excellent product excellent, very good shoes I love and attention was immediate, as received in good condition 100% recommended you purchase another opportunity lo maximo shoes ufff"
10409,1,"these slippers pretty much fit, i'm an 8 in street shoes so i ordered this half size bigger ( 8 1/2 ) and they fit perfectly! they look pretty awesome too!"
214774,1,"Better than they were when I got my first pair! Better look, feel and more comfortable than my old boots. Keep it up Wolverine!"
269310,0,Not as comfortable as the world walking classic shoe . i would recommend the latter although the pro walker is less money
189048,1,"I am a special ed teacher, have arthritis as a symptom of lupus and am in need of a total knee replacement. These shoes make me feel like I can run. They are so light and they conform to your feet and are a bit more acceptable for work than the regular croc clogs. I wear them with and without socks.They are true to size with a bit more room in the width. I am a 12 W and they fit great."
250643,1,"This is my forth pair of new balance 574s and I love them. They are very comfortable and well made. so far each time I've had to get a new pair it was from my wearing the soles down, not from falling apart. One of the things I really like about the shoes too is that aside from looking nice and being well made, they are relatively cheap. I wear a size 15 so it normally cost me a decent amount of money to get shoes. These are generally between $30-$45 when I buy them on Amazon. If you are looking for a comfortable everyday-shoe then these are a great option especially if you wear larger sizes."
318315,1,"Purchased these shoes for my husband as his work shoes. He wears them all the time..... absoutely LOVES them. Very comfortable, Real Leather."
299773,1,"I found these Birkenstocks through an amazon search, and was thrilled by the price. (About $40) I wear these shoes indoors nearly every day, so I have become attached to arizona birks because of their comfort and versility throughout the seasons. (Yes I wear socks with them) This particular variety appears to fit just a little differently at the toes than my last pair, but I am not sure if that is because the last ones had worn down by the end, or if this sizing is a little different.Either way, they are Birkenstocks, that outstanding brand of shoe, that lasts for years, and are so good to your feet."
177361,1,"I got a pair of yellow low-tops for Christmas last year and I LOVE THEM!!! They're about to get holes in them because I wear them so much, and I'm trying to pick out what color I should get. There's so much to love about these shoes. There's like 25 colors to pick from, so there is the oppourtunity to have a piar for EVERY SINGLE OUTFIT. Or, you can wear just one pair, like I do, and mine go with everything. These shoes are breathable, unlike tennis shoes, so your feet don't get all sweaty, which is nice too. These shoes are quite flat inside, but there's nothing that an insert can't fix. THESE SHOES ARE THE BEST!!!"
109010,1,"I love these! Softspots knows how to make them comfortable right away. Yes, they come a little snug, but it gives them the ability to shape to your feet. Very attractive! Highly recommend!"
387066,0,I like this shoe its comfortable and looks nice. The only thing that I've been disappointed about so far is that after I washed shoes on gentle cycle some of the pieces started to separate from the shoe.
223506,0,wasn't great for me. Those thongs are too roomy for me. I have a thin feet so they weren't good on me. If you buy them get size 1/2 smaller than your real size.
59359,1,This boot is comfortable and gives me the ankle support I've needed for any type of hiking. I look forward to many years of use from these boots.
124203,1,"I really like this shoe. I wear a narrow shoe and it is sometimes difficult to find narrow ones. However, this shoe runs quite narrow. I'm quite confident that it will ""streatch"" out with some wear as the shoe is genuine leather. All in all, I am pleased with the shoes."
250006,1,"This is the 2nd pair of these same shoes I've purchased (from Amazon), and I love them! They fit just as expected, are lightweight, and have a really versatile color. Since they're a neutral color, I can wear them with both casual clothing and slightly nicer clothes like khakis with an untucked polo. I may even buy another pair in 3 or so years when this pair wears out!"
3771,1,Its a nice shoe... it beats the shoes I had been wearing before. I got the wide version since my feet are a bit wide. I don't like how shoes get narrow at the tip. They need to make some wide toed hiking shoes.
142441,1,"I wear these shoes absolutely everywhere because they are so good to my feet. I will be getting another pair without holes for cooler weather. My daughter works in a hospital, so I gave her a pair. She says she wants a pair in every color."
203691,0,"These shoes are super cute, but not meant for long walks. I have found them to be as comfortable as you would expect a shoe with this heel height and they always get noticed and complimented."
362592,1,I GOT MY SHOES IN THE MAIL VERY FAST I LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING I WEAR I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM.
69223,1,"These boots are warm and comfortable. I had frostbitten my feet in the past and my feet get cold quickly. These boots allow me to stand out on the cold, snowy ground for a long period of time without getting cold. Thanks Columbia!"
223300,1,"These are the best shoes I have ever worn in any sport. I play senior ""over 50"" slow pitch softball and the cushion in these are gentle on old knees. Several ladies on the team bought them and all rave about them."
64978,1,"Total satisfaction, works perfectly, everything ok, this product its ok, and it can be recommended for others users without doubt"
119904,1,These Bearpaws are a great boot. Every bit as good as UGG yet 1/3 the price.
175878,1,I purchase this sandals for my mother. She likes this sandals because they are very soft and easy to put on. Also the leather is very soft and comfortable.
118256,1,"Nice ballet shoe for the price. My preschooler wears a 9 in street shoes and the 9.5 was best in this as it gave her a tiny bit of room. Technically they should fit the foot, but she liked it that way."
247425,1,Angel II is a slightly improved (more graceful-looking) version of a versatile old favorite. It is almost a flat but looks enough like a classic heel to endear itself to those of us who can't endure anything higher. And it comes in a welcome range of widths and colors.
184583,0,"I had a pair of these already and ordered another pair the very same size. The shoes I received were marked the same size, but turned out to actually be a full size smaller. I gave them away."
344489,1,"Twice I have ordered from Luskey's and twice I received the boots well packed, shipped with no dents.Only thing, wished I had an e-mail they had been shipped and when to expect delivery.I will certainly order from them again!"
143451,1,This style is difficult to find and I am pleased to find this source. Purchasing from Amazon is easy and expeditious.
279825,1,They are great with the costume and well made. Very Happy with the product.
370365,1,Vert comfy - but I would suggest a half size to full size larger if you are not fimilliar with such bodacious heels - they make your legs look KILLER!
26142,1,"The 990 Serries New Balance are some of the best shoes availible. After standing on concrete floor for 8 to 10 hours per day, I found other brands looked great, but were uncomfortable after 3 or 4 months. The New Balance shoes lasted twice as long and cost about the same price as the Nike and other brands I had previously purchased. I've bought nothing but New Balance ever since - for over 10 years now. Beside the durablity and the correct size avalibility, I find wearing shoes made in the USA rather than Korea or China a major plus!"
231698,1,"I have weird shaped feet. These shoes are comfortable, fit easily on my strange feet, and my feet look better in these Tevas!"
6487,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
237717,1,"My daughter has what you would call a &quot;Princess&quot; foot. She is super fussy about her shoes. Has to fit just so and no fabric rub or discomfort when she walks. She also has a hard to fit foot. Narrow heel and wider toebox. Thus shoe shopping for her can be a chore!Recently she picked up a cute little strappy dress for summer and I mentally prepared myself for the hours she would spend finding a summery sandal to go with it.When we went to the shoe store they had a large display of Dr. Scholl's in an assortment of colors.I remembered Dr. Scholl's from my teens. They used to sell them in the drugstore.The look is timeless and she instantly fell in love with them. Because the strap across the toes is adjustable they fit her toebox comfortably. And because they are backless, they are light and breezy for summer and there is nothing in the back to cause foot discomfort.The hard part was selecting the color. The sandals come in a variety of fun colors including pink, black, tan and more. We settled on the blue. Great with jeans and a nice shade to compliment her summer dress.Because the sandals feature a wood finished bottom and contoured footbed for arch support they are sturdy and comfortable.Price is right too when you consider they will last for years and remain classic in styling.Picking Dr. Scholl's is easy. Picking the color is the challenge!"
95216,1,Hardrock Trail Runner - Men's by MontrailShoes top quality though tight in width; would prefer tab on back to use in putting on the shoes.
178,1,"Purchased these boots originally for my son (the outdoor / boy scout / hiker) ... then went camping but my old boots (Vasque Clarion Impact Gore-Tex Hiking Boot ) which were tight even at a size 11 W... (I wear a 10.5 EEE) ... I decided to try these boots HiTec Boots at size 13M... thinking, why not give them a chance... on a weekend camp out in mud, rain and lots of walking (a Mountain Man theme camp out). The boots fit great... granted a bit long, but the width was just right, I replaced the insole with a pair of Spenco(r) Heavy Duty Insoles... they were comfortable and they kept my feet dry. So, I did the next logical thing, bought a pair for me, same size, and all... word of advise, I bought these in 11 W, they were to thin, I then bought size 13M... maybe it was just my feet, but they work for me... with a good insole, and a great lace technique, you have a good boot... enjoy."
162599,1,best pair of boots I have in my closet; very comfortable; easy to walk in and elegently designed. I bought the black leather ones
136016,1,"muy buen producto y muy buen vendedor, todo me salio como yo esperava y hasta ahora todo esta muy bien."
91672,0,"I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
155487,1,"This is the second pair of these boots that I order. My husband is an officer on his feet for over 12 hours and these give him support, comfort, and style. He likes the way they look and feel, and they keep a nice shine with minimal polishing. His last pair lasted him 8 years and I hope these will as well. And you can't beat the price!"
15935,1,"I bought these for my 18 month old daughter. They are adorable with tights! She loves having these on. I'd say they run a little big, but I'm fine with that. It's sometimes nice to have sneakers to put on her that she can't take off!"
375464,2,These boots fell apart within one month of purchasing them!! Do not purchase these boots!!
154947,1,"I don't care what Capezio's sizing chart says...these are not true to size. I took my daughter to the shoe store to get her exact size before ordering. She is a 13.5. I ordered a 1.5 and her toes were at the end. So we ended up with a 2,which is just right. They are very cute and seem to be well-made. This is my daughter's first pair of ballet shoes and she loves them. The price on Amazon is reasonable."
294851,0,"I own several other pairs of Allen Edmonds - Park Avenues in 11D, Kenwoods in 11D, Meranos in 11D. All fit very well (though the Park Avenues are a tiny bit tight). After reading the reviews here, I ordered the Walden in 11E.Even an 11E is too tight for me. I'm not sure how the sizing works on these, but it's not right. Would highly recommend trying them on somewhere before purchasing them."
68087,1,"The county fair was coming into town so I wanted a pair of boots to wear during the week. My cowgirl friend had told me Ariat boots were her favorite, so that is what i searched and these were the cheapest ones I could find. I ordered them in an 8 1/2 which is what I wear in a tennis shoe. I ordered 2 day shipping and they came in 2 days! It was great shipping. When I tried them on, they were a little big, but I went and bought a pair of thick knee-high socks and wore them for a couple days and they fit great. I had to break them in like every pair of shoe, but once I got those socks they fit perfect and I feel that if I would have gotten an 8 size, they would have been too small. Great buy!! Don't hesitate:-)"
344195,1,"I love my new shoes! they fit great and look great. My daughter keeps taking them so I may have to get her a pair. nah, let her get her own!!"
340192,1,Quick delivery and item was just as described. These are pretty hard to find so I was very happy to get these for my husband
153330,0,"Beware...Darkest blue ever, almost black. Don't know if wrong color was sent or that the picture does not represent the true color."
222303,0,"The loafers didn't fit but I don't think I would have kept them even if they did. I was not happy with the quality of the leather. It cost almost $10 out of pocket to send them back, and this was the cheapest way to ship."
112806,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
11241,1,"I bought it for my girlfriend because it's her favorite ballet shoe, it's the second she have, all the same, she doesn't change it for others."
43606,0,"The leather on the Student Footlight is pretty stiff and will definitely need some breaking in. I'm hoping that it will soften quickly once it warms up after being worn.My actual shoe size is 9AAA but I frequently wear 8 1/2 N because I can rarely find the 9AAA. In the Jr. Footlight, I wear a 9 1/2 N. When I was trying to decide what size to get in the Student Footlight, I wondered if the fit was similar to the Jr. Footlight and I have to say the Student runs closer to street size. Based on my experience with the Jr. Footlight, I ordered the Student in a 9N and a 9 1/2 N and both were too long. The shoe does seem to run pretty narrow, for those who are wondering. I think the width will be fine once I get the length right.I didn't find a significant difference in the padding/insole of either shoe. High density foam, not much arch support. Not a cushy shoe underneath the foot, but then that may be because it is meant for dance and their assumption is that the wearer would want to be able to ""feel"" the floor through the shoe.As compared to the jr. footlight, the extra 1/2 inch in the heel height of the Student Footlight does make a difference in the leg line and will make the legs look even better on stage or anywhere else."
285203,1,"I have found athletic/walking shoes to be cheap and without support. Today, shoes are marketed as being lightweight which in my book does not make a good shoe. Eastland shoes provide the support that my feet need."
244283,1,"These shoes are great! My kiddie has a wide foot and I was unable to find shoes that fit him well. He is 10 months and walking, these shoes provide the support I was looking for."
171407,1,"This shoe was received correctly, BUT THE SECOND PAIR I ORDERED AT THE SAME TIME WERE SENT TO ME INCORRECTLY. THE WRONG COLOR WAS SENT. I HAD TO PAY ABOUT $10.00 TO RETURN THEM AND REQUESTED YOU SEND ME THE RIGHT COLOR (GREEN), BUT THE SAME INCORRECT COLOR WAS SENT TO ME THE SECOND TIME, WHICH MEANS I WILL HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER $10.00 TO RETURN THESE. I DARE NOT REQUEST THE CORRECT ONES AGAIN. I WOULD BE MOST GRATEFUL IF SOMEONE WOULD GET IN TOUCH WITH ME TO GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED...THANK YOUMARY GARTER"
293366,1,Great rock shoe. Well worth the money and good on almost all types of climbing. Don't get em too tight. I like to buy them so they fit comfortabley as there is very little stretch to the shoe.
332206,1,"Normally I wear a 7, some brands I wear a 7 1/2 just in case and this would be one of them. They are very narrow so buy a size higher. They are very cute because they are so unique. Even though it says ""green"" color I would classify them more as brown."
207555,0,"I purchased my rampante last week and tested it for twice so far. I have to say I am kind of dissapointed because I thought these were the perfect soccer shoes for me. The truth is the shoes are a little bit too narrow, and there is no improvment in shooting compared to cheaper shoes. I used to have lotto primato before and the shooting accurecy is same in reebok rampante. However reebok rampante's heel comfort is way advance than lotto primato, or other cheaper shoes. Nonetheless if you don't wanna pay $200 for a puma or adidas predator mania, reebok might be the second choice for you."
55891,1,Comfortable!Love it! Looks great with skinny jeans. DIdn't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand.. oh wells. Love it! looks so clean and cute.
259251,1,Chucks are the perfect shoe. They came quickly and it was easy. The shoes fit perfect and they've been great!
23994,1,Great flip flop for the money...premium construction and the guys LOVE the bottle opener in the sole!
351159,1,"I have worn several issue boots that ranged from really good (Matterhorn ICB's) to terrible (Vietnam Era Jungle Boots were still issued in 1999 when I enlisted). USMC issues Danners now, and I have always heard great things about Danner boots. I'm in a rare spot in the military that still wears black boots and these fit the required specs nicely. The comfort is unmatched by anything I have owned to date.For comfort, they required zero break-in period. My only complaint is that the leather is squeaky. Flexing & extending my toe makes a lot of noise (it's not the sole) but this will probably (hopefully) break in. I have never had all-leather boots before, so maybe that is leather's M.O.Unfortunately I am resigned to a desk for the time being so I can't speak to how they do in the elements. They are damm sexy though.The price is good compared to Danner's website and a big thanks to all stores (including this one) on amazon that ship to FPO/APO. It's just like shipping to New York, so spread the word to all the vendors."
334413,1,"While I wouldn't wear this shoe to work out, it makes a great comfortable casual shoe. It is very well made model."
204560,1,These flip flops are awesome! So comfortable to bought 2 more pairs in different colors. My feet do not get sweaty in these flip flops like many of the plastic type ones.
66788,1,Love my chucks. This is my second pair. The blue goes with everything. I teach preschool and they are comfortable and fun to wear to work.
187481,1,My granddaughter loves her Uggs and they were delivered before Christmas - which was an added bonus since the promised delivery date was after Christmas. 3 out of the six females in the family now have Uggs.
361112,2,"Soon after I bought a pair, . i uses them A little . A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins."
234219,1,"This is my 3rd pair of these exact shoes. I know, I know. It is not normally my style to buy the same pair of shoes 3 times in a row, but these are great and feel very comfortable. I seem to be able to keep these clean and nice for a whole year. i am hard on shoes, these take a beating and stay looking nice with just a little TLC. Great product, thanks!"
236969,1,My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them. He says they are comfortable and also look good. I would recommend them to anyone.
63634,1,Great buy. Size fit perfectly. Normal wear and tear is almost unnoticeable. I gave them a four because in the beginning they cut at the back of my ankle but after a month or so of wearing them out they now fit like a glove. Came before delivery date. I highly recommend them. :) :) :) :) :)
326856,1,I've been running in Asics shoes for more than 10 years. The GT series continues to provide good fit and comfort.
4714,1,Bungalow360 makes great stuff! This whale bag was a great gift idea!!! They offer bags with different animals that are cutely designed!
13503,1,"Chuck Taylors are my favorite shoes. I have used them for years because they're comfortable, casual and have character. I replace them when they get too worn. I've been buying them online for a while. I found them here for under 40 bucks which was a steal. I received them in just a few days. I couldn't be happier with my new chucks."
343893,1,Thank you so much for your prompt arrival!! These were purchased as a gift to my best mate and the godfather to my daughter as he is a bit addicted to shoes! He absolutley loved them and put them on straight away! He found that the added spare pair of red laces was an added bonus! The size was perfect and the description exactly as advertised!Thank you again for your quick service and quality product!
275394,1,Very comfortable. I'm waiting for winter too fully enjoy the comfort.Hopefully it will survive the approaching cold weather. Yes do buy.
262834,1,"I've been looking for red chucks for a while now. I love these!! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though, they run quite large."
323260,1,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt. A lot! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. but other than that they really have nice ankle protection, by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them. i would and did recommend them to everyone. so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent!"
218501,1,"I had the experience of having to exchange these shoes. It was fairly simple and I had no issues. I ordered them as a Christmas present for my daughter. They arrived fairly quickly in the mail. Though we ordered her normal size, they were about 1/2 size too large. So I followed the online instructions and sent them back for an exchange. I received a replacement in just a little over a week. I was impressed with the quick turnaround. The only drawback is that I had to pay to ship them back and also include a check for $7.99 to cover shipping of the new shoes."
340745,0,"It is true that they come larger than the regular size. They are comfortable casual shoes but would recommend them for long walks, they give me blisters."
34492,1,"I am not a flashy person, but I do like a great ""pop"" in a shoe. Nine West always makes a comfy shoe with style and this is no exception. The fushia works well with the gold accents. Every time I wear these shoes, they stir up comments - the good kind! Great with jeans or a skirt, these are a great accent piece to any wardrobe."
29316,1,"I am very satisfied with the shoes, I have 2 pairs."
96610,1,"Great warmth, comfort and quality ... IF you order 2 sizes larger than what you wear. These slippers are wayyyy small. Also order the ""W"" for wide. You will NEED it. I wear mens size 12. Based on other reviews, I ordered size 13W. Wish I had ordered one size larger."
72788,1,i am very pleased with my product- it was a gift for my son who is an avid skate boarder and vans has b come 1 of his favorite shoes
340908,0,"These look better in the picture, and I was expecting the heels to be a higher, but they're very comfortable shoes. You can walk all day in them."
373276,1,"These Boots are it! I bought a pair (Non-steel toe) about 10 years ago for working around my hobby farm. I loved them, but when I tried to get another pair a couple years ago, I found out they were out of production. Tried several other brands/styles since then with poor results - I work on concrete floors all day now and need something that feels like a walking shoe, but can handle oil spills and such. So, a few months ago while about to buy yet another brand, I looked for these Carolina's again, and much to my surprise, I found there are back!! I immediately bought a pair to see if they were the same. Not quite, but still better than any others I've tried.PRO:Glove leather-ish soft.Very comfortable sole that is flexible, not stiff as steel, VERY MINIMAL break in period.Very sturdy lace hooks (better than my first pair).CON:None yet."
40323,1,"A great basic flip flop, goes with anything but can be more than just super casusal!"
157976,1,"These converse came just as I expected, since I wear converse I knew what to expect. I usually wear a 9.5 in women but go down half a size in these guys and they fit perfect (7 in converse). Good price too, cheaper than usual."
249238,0,I am unable to work in these for more then 2 or 3 hours. These shoe start to hurt my toes within that time.
376424,1,"I wear a half-size smaller because these shoes come in wide sizes (i.e they fit)! I'm curious to see how long they will last as they are guaranteed for 1000 miles. Very attractive and comfortable, and reasonably priced. I recommend the quick-adjust velcro for anyone who walks before or after work, or at lunch, or who takes shoes on & off throughout the day."
109390,1,This a a great classic shoe--just too bad they're not made in the USA anymore.
311942,1,"Used to wear these years ago and just got out of the habit, am so glad to find them again and I know I will be ordering them again."
104925,1,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
258150,0,These are great shoes once your toddler is truly toddling. They are hard rubber soles and great for outside time. They are not slipper-like. A bit clunky looking.
302493,1,The crocs are just as I'd heard...comfortable and cushy. I used to wear tennis shoes to walk but now wear the crocs.
342537,1,"Time-tested. This shoe goes really well with a great number of things, and I find myself wearing them even when the snow is piled high solely because I like the look.Protip: if it's rainy/snowy, be sure that your laces are tied in a manner that doesn't allow you to step on them, because if you do, you'll get the laces dirty, which, in turn, will cause them to fling up while you're walking and cover your shoes in wet, dirty water, making short work of the pristine, white look."
43591,1,i love it... was a little bigger that i expected but i guess my son will get more use from it lol lol... hope it last...
129071,1,"I go through a pair of these each year, and I keep coming back to them. They are comfortable, durable, fairly light and priced right. I usually buy these at a police supply site, but Amazon is much more convenient and had them at a better price. I highly recomend these, and their shorter cousin, the 6 inch ATAC side zip."
57523,1,"I love Keds and they're always true to size, so nice to know I can order them here. I'll likely order more."
182081,1,Great boots. These boots are comfortable and give good support. Have used Danner work boots and Danner hiking boots. They are the best boots I have worn.
135574,1,These are the most comfortable sandles ever! I own about 12 pair and would wear them to work if they were a little more dressier. Please buy them from the White Mountain wholesaler as I have bought these from other dealers and the bottom sole has come apart from the sandle......
183996,1,"I've been a Dansko wearer for about 5 years now. I still wear my first pair, but have several others. I am a hairstylist so a good, supportive shoe is a must. I have to warn anyone who wants a pair of these to keep something in mind; if they fit you in the heel they are too small! There should be a bit of ""slip"" when you walk in this shoe, as it should feel like a clog. People who don't like them usually buy the wrong size. A great investment!"
21947,1,i was looking everywhere for a deal and found the m VERY CHEAP priced here. overall the shoes look very cool and are extremely light. im used to vans shoes that feel heavy on the feet but these shoes are very light and thin as if walking on air. i like them so far. not bad at all.
223312,1,"Original brand new Timberland.Boots are very confortable, as usual with TimberlandConfortable and cheapest priceI'm Very satisfied and I can suggest this purchaseVery fast shipping also"
274923,1,"This is a ""narrow"" in Birkenstock speak, but I've got a wide foot and it still works for me. What a bargain! This is a full coverage clog in great quality suede, and usually around $130 in stores.Generally, Birks are the most comfortable shoe I can wear - with wide flat feet, most North American sizes are too narrow. With the contoured footbed, I get an arch support and heel cup which actually supports my foot without trying to contort it to someone else's foot shape.I am very, very psyched to have found this on Amazon. Please bring more!"
1395,1,there is not one single other item I would consider more vital to surviving an outbreak of the walking dead. these are a must have.
125640,1,"Bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions. It is stable, comfortable, provides good traction, and is warm without being sweaty. I would strongly recommend this boot."
208971,1,"This is my 2nd time ordering these shoes. The shoes are well made, and long lasting. I feel like I am wearing house slippers when I wear these shoes yet they are supportive to my high arch. The shoes seem to run true to size. They are of good quality and long lasting. i highly recommend these shoes for those of us who do a lot of standing and/or walking."
78426,1,"can't ever go wrong with a pair of chucks! they always say go a half a size down, but in my boyfriends case he had to go a full size down, and me i'm safe with going half a size down..so it definitly varys"
82941,1,These are some of my most comfortable and dependable flip flops I've ever owned. I had my first pair for eight years until darling puppy decided to chew them into peices. I was so elated to discover that they're still available and I ordered a replacement pair. Super comfortable that gets better with time - great arch support.
113958,2,Beautiful ..... but no use. Faulty design. Can not keep them on my feet.The back of the shoe is short and wide. Nothing seems to work gel pads exc...
306154,1,"I've been wearing these shoes to office for years. This purchase was my third pair. I wore out the other two after replacing soles at least once. The shoes are great. Simple design, hold up well, break in period is about a day and wear very comfortably after that. Bought the first two pairs at department store. This was the first time I purchased shoes through Amazon. No problems with mail purchase. Same shoes, better price. When this pair is worn out, I'll buy a another - through Amazon."
373354,1,"I bought the Propet Women's Stability Walker for my wife. This is in Black 6 2E for $20.78 (got a great deal on the price) with free shipping via Amazon Prime. Happy with the purchase overall, however I feel that the width runs small. My wife prefers wide shoes and I went up to 2E from C/D just to be safe but now I wish I had got the 4E. The shoe looks great though and my wife finds the cushioning very comfortable. Perhaps the overall fit will improve after breaking the shoe in a bit."
133884,1,"I've been wearing these shoes for years and love them. I ordered them because I have not seen them in black in the stores. Unfortunately, they were too small and had to be returned. I am probably going to reorder. My advice is to order a half size larger than you normally wear. Otherwise, they are a well constructed, long lasting shoe perfect for every day wear."
216675,1,"The shoes looks good and are well made, I know how young people like to stay in style and they arrived well in the time frame given."
141977,0,"This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
251484,1,I found these to be a perfect fit. They are very comfortable and great for those long shopping trips. Look very nice with both casual dress and jeans.
24318,1,"Who notices a man's shoe?Well, oddly enough people have had nice compliments. They are comfy and easy to slip on if you need to jump out a window at a moment's notice. The tread on them is interesting. I can't say what long time wearing will do to it but it borders on wearing rubber cleats without scuffing the floor.I say buy them ... but then what would make me special for wearing them if you have the same pair?"
320309,1,"lots of comments about size ...so much so that i anticipated having to send them back.here's my advice - don't use the size charts listed because its way off. Do this:get a tape measure - stand on it, measure from the bottom rear of your foot up to the tip of your big toe...then match that with the size next to it... (skip all the US/ EU / GB size... they are clearly wrong on the size listing)So, my daughters measurement was 10"" from back to tip - we ordered size 9. Perfect fit.okay, material quality is nice for wearing around the house or art school... but from what i could tell, it won't stand up to constant use. But hey, they're inexpensive (relatively speaking) so buy a few pair.m"
140648,1,"These are so very easy to wear - comfortable from day 1, cushy, durable, and casual looking as opposed to sloppy. This is the 3rd pair I've purchased (my sister absconded with my 2nd pair)."
307746,1,"When basketballer Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Taylor walked into the Converse company back in 1921 complaining of sore feet, he started a revolution. He designed a shoe that was to bear his name only two years later. It would go on to be THE most popular sneaker of all time. Over 500 million pairs have been sold worldwide. The popularity of these legendary shoes has gone in waves but people have always come back to Chucks throughout the past 80 years! And some people, like myself, just can't get enough of them, and go on to build a collection of these wonderful sneakers. Nowadays I only wear Chucks, no other sneaker graces my feet. They are so comfortable and good looking, and take it from me, they boost your self-esteem! Walk down the street in them and you feel ten feet tall. Sounds corny, but it's true. They're like a security blanket around your ankles. I absolutely love Chucks and won't ever stop wearing them. Do yourself a favour, buy a pair. Then see how long till you get another and another."
338475,1,"As the title says, I believe this is an essential purchase for any man. They're comfortable, light, and good looking. The flat sole is great for extended walking and sports (specially weight lifting in my case). I like how they look and make my feet look slim as well. Heheh. Combined with my other clothing, I like how they help make everything seem that much ""tighter"". These are just a must have :)"
22332,1,I got this as a gift for my husband. Everyday he comes home talking about how comfortable these shoes are.
215044,1,"Great quality boot -- I'm always willing to pay a little more for the MADE IN USA tag, but didn't have to this time! My husband goes through boots very quickly, so these will be getting re-ordered!"
96601,1,"I can't say enough about this shoe.I had surgery on both feet and so before and after this, was well-acquainted with musculo-skeletal pain, and with many types of ""comfort"" shoes (no high heels for me!). I also lived in NYC (the walking-on-concrete capital of the universe!!!); which exacerbated many of my foot-knee-hip-back pains. and I work in medical care, where I cover 12-hr (plus) shifts on my feet....quite a recipe for VERY sore feet.these shoes saved my feet!! they are the most comfortable, most long-lasting, most sole-saving shoes I have ever found. I can work a 12 hour shift and I have close to no discomfort. I can stand for long periods of time with no foot pain.I would recommend these shoes to anyone who 1) has to do a lot of city walking, 2) spends long hours on their feet, and 3) has sore feet (or other joints) in general.excellent, excellent shoe."
82171,1,"I ordered two of these for grocery shopping. I also ordered 3 of another canvas type. Should have ordered all 5 as this bag. Great bag. Stupendous even! Just like the pricer Lands' End bags. Study, well stitched. I hauled 4 2-liter bottles today in one and it didn't strain at all. This tote is worth every penny paid and definately would purchase again should I need more totes in the future. PS - love that outside pocket - I now have somewhere to keep a pen for shopping!"
256000,1,"These shoes are so comfortable. I ordered mine in black/silver. They look a tad bit dressier than a regular black flat shoe, but they are as comfortable as a tennis shoe."
223814,0,i have owned 86 pair of the 4600 over the last 15 years. i know the shoe. this purchase was for the 85th and 86th pair.the tongue is 1/3rd as thick on these compaired to the other 84 pairthe name on the heel is half as dark as the other 84 pairthe &#34;v&#34; shape on the sole side is 1/2 as dark as the other 84 pairnot sure they are the real thing. bought my last pair in december 12 and that pair matched the previous 83 pair. if reebok has changed the shoe in 2 months then they must be real if not then something is wrong with these two pair
47013,0,"First, buy half size lower than your normal size. These boots are really made for riding, and that's why I bought them. With the relatively higher heel and heaviness,, not a good walking boot (foot moves up and down). But they are well made, durable, and nice and sturdy for Harley riding...and they look good."
48348,1,I've been wearing zories for 50 years and these are the absolute best! The best thing is this rubber doesn't rub the top of your foot - no blisters like plastic or cheap rubber - and they are super cushy and amazingly durable. I've got 3 pairs so far and am sure I'll need more.
59079,0,These shoes are very light and appear durable. I had hoped for more spring in the step. I find that it is difficult to tie the shoes with the tightness I prefer.
348979,1,"All great, this is my 3rd justin in 7 years, very comfortable, soft & good color,I recommend it for daily use."
364215,1,"[[ASIN:B000FAI9X0 Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top red high top tennis shoes.They were just what the kid wanted, and they fit. He has been wearing them daily. Great!Vazel"
71343,1,"I purchased my Men's Irish Setter Countrysiders because I suffer from plantar fasciitis, and I also have weak ankles. I teach middle school, and I am on my feet all day. I wore Rockports for a while, but they did not give me the ankle support that I needed. I stumbled upon these Men's Irish Setter Countrysiders while doing a google search. They are great! The insoles are removeable (perfect for me because I wear custom orthotics). They do need a couple of days to break in just above the inside ankles because they are boots, but then they fit like a glove!I am about to purchase my 2nd pair."
129534,1,"I love this shoe so much! I bought this in about five different colors. I'm eager to see how many more they come out with. I am trying to keep up with what they offer because they sell out fast. If you're looking for the perfect career shoe, I highly recommend this one. I am especially partial to the brown leather."
278848,1,The shoe I bought was extremely cool! The last time I had a shoe like this was about three years ago. Its a Vans Omar Hassan all black super suede pretty much like this design. The difference was eS was more rugged and tough looking than the Omar Hassan series. I would love to see eS create more designs in the same super suede all black series. You can wear it likewise in semi-formal attire. My only regret is that I didnt bought a spare one for the future.
46776,1,Love this shoe for my baby.Another one to add to his collection of Chucks.
159528,2,if you want to be liked dont pick these there are so 5 years ago i wouldnt reccomend these to humans
346998,0,"These shoes are okay, they are poorly cut and cramp my toes, though. I use them just as ""costume"" shoes as they are wearable for short periods only."
261032,1,"The shoes arrived in perfect condition, true to size (10.5) fabulous bright red color, not a problem at all. Would definitley do business with the seller again. Thank you!"
295923,1,"Life in the midwest winters means lots of ice. I couldn't survive the winter without Yaktrax. They're great for walking on ice, snow, and trampled down snow from plows and blowers. I haven't had a tumble on the ice since I found these and they make pushing the snowblower much easier, too."
315155,0,"Short and simpleThese boots are very attractive. And very comfortable. Also , roomy in the toes.I worn them today for the first time in 23 degrees weather with one pair of socks.My feet FROZE!!!! these boots are not for warmth."
117215,1,"These are awesome, if you have wide feet, my suggestion is that you go up one size, don't go with the wide version. The wide version makes your foot look huge, and the instep, where you most likely need the width, is wider, but padded, so not really wider :) These ones are sharp!"
41897,1,These are excellent shoes with a lot of support. I wear them at work and to hike in. They're very tough.
24760,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
98292,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. They are literally like you are walking on air. Usually when I buy Mary Jane's they slide up and down on my heel but these do not.
26373,1,"If you are an avid runner that appreciates comfortable shoes, then buy these shoes. The 991 is the only shoe that I have purchased more than once. I have tried many others and these are my favorite."
112888,1,I have purchased this same shoe in 3 colors over the years.I love Mocs and especially those made of deerskin or moose hide as they are supple and conform to the contour of you feet and then fit like a glove.I say - buy them.
26068,1,"If you are an avid runner that appreciates comfortable shoes, then buy these shoes. The 991 is the only shoe that I have purchased more than once. I have tried many others and these are my favorite."
273093,1,"HELP!, I need somebody, HELP! Not just anybody....and soforth. I cant buy these shoes ANYWHERE!!! Ive searched all over and they either dont have them in my size or I just cant buy them. this site wont let me buy them cuz it isnt listened as a product i can buy... i have no idea why. If any1 has any information on where i can get my hands on these shoes please email me at: stevemosca@hotmail.com"
142132,1,Comfortable!Love it! Looks great with skinny jeans. DIdn't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand.. oh wells. Love it! looks so clean and cute.
20482,1,"I have 3 pairs of these, one in each color. I LOVE THEM. Nice fit, very well made, durable and classic. With my unusual size (13 3E) I am very happy they make such a good looking shoe that fits me. I highly recommend them!"
194298,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
242174,1,These shoes were 20$ cheaper than the sale price on the converse website. The shoes seem to be authentic. Shipping was fast.
202597,0,"The shoe is a dark brown color; not a dark tan as depicted in the photo. I have been wearing these shoes for several years and this is the first time I bought them on line. It is not the color I was expecting. However, I will keep them anyway."
337385,1,My fiance loves the boots. They were supposed to be a surprise gift for Christmas but the shipper sent them wrapped only in clear plastic and ruined the surprise. Prob won't buy from them again.
284760,1,These shoes are the best. They are so comfortable and really cute. I got the lilac patchwork ones and I wish I had gotten a couple of more colors before they sold out.
136104,1,"I got a pair of converse shoes for Christmas almost 3 years ago, and I have been wearing these shoes almost ever since. They feel comfortable, they look good, and they have hardly any wear on them after 3 years. As a matter of fact, I have them on right now as i am writing this review..I'm thinking about buying another pair in a different color just because i love them so much."
58195,1,"I love these shoes. Very cute, simple, classic style. The graphite color is very versatile (comes with white laces if you don't dig the yellow). Some arch support for comfort and good structure to the shoe. I wouldn't run a marathon in these shoes, but they are perfect on the weekends or vacation, when you be doing a good amount of walking but still want to look cute."
350622,0,"outlook is pretty good than the quetion about comfort,not so comfortable as aspecting"
368841,1,These shoes are very comfortable and I love the stitching on the sides and along the heel. These would be great for casual as well as work wear.
43802,1,"I work at an airport and am standing up to 8 hours or more per day. Bought the Professional 3 years ago and they are still in great shape. Looking for new pair as with all shoes the heal does wear down, but it took 3 years to wear. Would have many pairs in all the colors for my personal wardrobe if not for the price. Only other downfall is that I am not comfortable in any other shoes, even my athletic shoes.Dansko Professional"
217008,1,This pair is as good as described but i have to return it because i dont use shoes with laces and picture was not very clear. Return policy and customer service is top rated.
254957,1,"So, what the deal with the sizing info amazon gives, they list different countries, are these sizes UK or US sizes? The chart is usless without knowing.It would seem UK."
388366,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
144323,1,NB is the only sneaker I will buy. Love the look of this one and it is very confortable. Great colors too.
76269,1,I love these shoes! I am going on 15 years wearing them. I have replaced them 3 times. I can not imagine wearing anything else in the summer. I have extra wide feet and the front adjustment allows you to keep your toes from getting crushed! There is a nice space for your orthotic inserts too.Additionally these shoes are very well made. They will last you! I wore my last pair for 5 years!! And considering I wear them every day from April through October that really says something.I give these a triple A. I already brought a spare pair I will hide in the back of my closet for 2017 when these wear out.... YES they are THAT GOOD!!
262716,1,I find these shoes to be the most comfortable things in the world. They complement my clothes very well. But the down side is that with all of the snow we have recieved here on the east coast....wearing them outside is not a good idea. Especially if you want to keep you feet warm. But all in all.....I love my shoes.
98584,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
32645,1,"Arrived in good condition. My daughter is a size 6 1/2-7, so I ordered these in size 8.5. This was the smallest size available at the time, and after reading other reviews thought it would be smart to order larger in case they fit small and hard to put on. I would say the size is pretty true to fit. The 8.5 were pretty big for my 2/12 year old. She isn't wearing them much since they are a little too big in size, and they go high up in the leg so it's hard for her to walk. I had a hard time finding a pair online that were pink, not too high, and would ship to Canada. Overall, the product meets the description expectations, I just wish I found ones that went mid calf and would ship to Canada."
148066,1,"My boots just came in the mail today and they're great! They're really well made, however, they're narrow. I wear a size 10 1/2, so if you wear a half size, go up to the next size. If your feet aren't narrow, ""normal"" width, or wide, i suggest going up ANOTHER size. I bought a size 12, so they fit perfectly, and they've got room for my toes to wiggle, they don't hurt at all. I'm 5'11"" and it's hard to find heels that don't hurt, but these are nice. They don't stand straight up on their own either, so they're real easy to get on and they crunch around your ankles and thighs which makes them look really nice. If you're not used to wearing heels, the heel on them is real thin and it may take some getting used to to walk in them. But otherwise, no complaints, they're comfortable and beautiful!!"
362325,1,"I love these sneakers, I've worn through pair after pair over the years and I keep buying more. They are super light and cushiony, great for walking or running. I just can't get into new styles of running shoes that feel clunky, heavy or throw me off balance. These classic joggers haven't changed in decades and are perfect just the way they are!"
126805,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
216593,1,Girlfriend loved them. Price was better then local area stores. She has other colors of the same shoe so they last a lifetime.
195519,1,"Love this sandal! I have plantar fasciitis and have difficulty finding shoes with good arch support. This one is perfect for me. I initially had trouble with the strap between the toes but it resolved itself with a few short wearings around the house. The fit is true to size, the sole is not slippery, is comfortable and the style is wonderful! I know I'll get tons of compliments this summer because the one strap is plain leather and the other strap is a pattern. You don't see that in flip flops! Love the colors too. I'll be ordering another pair because you just can't have enough cool sandals."
45370,1,You must be careful with sizes. Seems the last several years there has been size creep by about a half size. i.e. 8.5 may be 9.
319876,1,Enjoy my shoes. Just came back from a long walk in them. Very happy with shoes and service
92241,1,"I love these sandals and have ordered them over the internet for many years. They are basically my favorite shoe and I order them in many colors. I fear that they are being phased out, as they are getting hard for me to find now."
198447,0,"This product fits way too big! I was disappointed by the lack of information about fitting. However, the product shipped fast. Just keep in mind that you should buy this product a size smaller"
105207,1,"These shoes are adorable. I have only had a chance to wear them once, but when I did I recieved plenty of compliments and no blisters. For the price they are amazing!!!"
164120,1,"I'm a firm believer in ""you get what you pay for."" And these shoes are a perfect example of that. This is my second pair of Merrells, my first set survived around 2 1/2 years of abuse before finally giving up. I wear them primarily as daily walkers (averaging 4-5 miles a day), but I've had no issue going off road with them. They've been with me in Iraq, Afghanistan, all over the US, and now Korea. They breathe well, are very comfortable, and this has been by far the best deal, price-wise. Do yourself a favor and get a set, you won't be disappointed."
374180,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
380869,1,"super fast delivery, fits great, great price. i am pleased. i wish i would have found these earlier! i m filled with joy"
16703,1,"I have been playing soccer for 13 years at many different levels (rec, select, high school, and college). I bought my first pair of copa's 9 years ago. They are by far the best cleats around for under $... They have lasted me about 2 years for each pair. They offer superb ball control, grip, ball feel, and kick velocity. They are simply the only thing I will wear to play competitive soccer."
133052,0,"This was my second pair of Rainbow sandals/flip flops, and the fit and feel are different from my first. The look, too, is different. I retuned the pair, thinking I might have the wrong size, and the second pair is just as disappointing.On the good side, the sellers had excellent service and response time to the issuesI'm not sure what happened, but the new Rainbows are not what they used to be, and just don't feel as comfortable; narrow and too snug."
205525,1,"If your feet don't go, you don't go. I bought my first pair of these over 20 years ago and I keep buying more as I tear them up, which takes some work. I've run, climbed buildings and hills, and walked miles in the Ft. Lewis boots and they keep you going."
153791,1,"Great seller, responded immediately to inquiries. Product arrived on time for Christmas and was exactly as described! I would buy from again. Thank you!"
338739,1,"My daughter loved the shoes. They are good quality and reasonable price. The vendor sent the shoes on time. My daughter says they are ""very cool"""
90192,1,"I read reviews of these before buying this pair - I have bought two pairs of Timberland boots before, one pair thats literally lasted app. 20 years with a lot of use, and another pair that only lasted two years. I received these in yesterday, and will update the review if they don't break in well or last. So far my impressions are - 1. Accurate to size, 13w, I wear New Balance / Nike wide tennis shoes as additional reference 2. Comfortable, but not cushiony if you know what I mean, I wore them all day yesterday without blisters or sore spots 3. I was expecting non insulated boots, which I got, but these are still warm to hot - gussetted tongue and no ventilation means these are not a boot I am looking forward to wearing on a construction site in the middle of a Texas summer. I have received in what I expected, and given Timberlands reputation and my exp I'm giving it 5 stars pending further experience with this pair of boots."
231510,1,"i normally wear a 7.5, i ordered a 7 and they are perfect. i love them. more support, and more comfortable than regular flip flops."
132896,0,"I'll give Ariat this - these are very cute boots! But unfortunately, the calf area is HUGE!!! I'm ""average"" (5'5) and the boots fit perfectly on my feet, but I can easy fit two of my calves in the boot. It was absurd - I've purchased several pairs of boots before, but these are definitely the biggest boot opening I've seen!The pair I got were already scratched (they were quite visible) on different parts of both boots, like someone had almost tried them on and in the process, scratched the leather to ensure deep marks. Also, there were black stains on one of my boots. I didn't spend a $140 on these boots so I could received used goods and defective goods. Don't plan to order from Bare Bones again."
354782,1,I bought it for my wife and she love them.... they even come with extra red laces... Everythin arrived on time and in perfect condition...Thanks
74715,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
322587,1,"I ordered these for my 8 year old daughter who wears between a 2.5 and 3 street shoe, depending upon the shoe. I ordered a size 4, hoping to get a couple of years out of them. They fit her nicely with room to grow, but not so much extra room that they will be cumbersome on her foot while dancing. The elastic laces allow you to tie the shoe a little snugger which helps when buying a slightly larger size -- it allows you to make it somewhat adjustable. They quality is excellent. My daughter liked 2 things about the shoes -- ""they feel good on my feet"", and ""they are such a pretty shade of pink....they are like a baby pink, not that orangey-pink like my last pair""."
370188,1,I have a big foot with bunion and they fit perfect. Men and women thought they are sexy and wanted to try on...!!
387111,1,"I got these a number larger than I normally get, because I have a very high wrist, and wasn't sure it would fit. They feel small in size, so the fit was perfect. They are very soft, and very warm, but I feel like I ""fall down"" to the floor in them, which is why I am only giving 4*. I also feel that they at times don't manage to warm my feet if they are already cold, which is a problem. But if I wear them all day, my feet are warm and snugly. I don't regret this purchase, and would recommend them to others."
34308,1,lasted through 4 years of high school wrestling and I've got no complaints. They're still in one piece which is more than I can say for the 2 backpacks I went through. Can't ask for anything more than that.
64428,1,"I love to wear my keds. The price, the quality and having them available was why I chose them,Its had to find keds this time of year. I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size, just leather not canvas material. Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found."
97826,1,i received the crocs 2 days after i ordered them. what a pleasant surprise. they fit beautifully and are sooo comfortable. this is my 3rd pair of crocs this year. i wear them everywhere. i highly reccomend them.
73544,0,Just what I was looking for BUT I wear a 7.5 and have a high arch. They ran small on me and I had a really hard time getting them on. It's a shame because I liked the look....has to send them back
154503,1,My husband loved his new boots for Christmas and loved that I found them for a better price through Amazon!
131659,1,"Use this attachment for my PEET dryer both for ski gloves, lighter gloves used for snow shoveling, and for my neoprene scuba gloves during the summer. Dries them all MUCH better than any other dryers I've tried in the past - gets the air into the fingers to dry them. Would probably be a bit difficult to get small gloves on the ""hands"" but works great for size large gloves."
33354,1,"The sandals fit great. My first try with Teva's after wearing Columbia's for years. Appreciate the strapping system that can be adjusted for my feet. Land to water is a good feature, too. Arrived quickly."
320829,1,"Bought these shoes in Taupe Satin and i love them, very comfy and delivery was so prompt, will be going for other colours."
80556,1,"I LOVE THESE CONVERSE! THEY ARE CLASSIC, COULDN'T FIND THEM ANYWHERE ELSE. THEY'VE RECEIVED MANY COMPLIMENTS!"
77869,1,I live up in New Hampshire where the weather can change every five minutes. These shoes are great for when the snow is melting and everything is wet r when the snow is only a few inches deep. I have worn these shoes from going out to get the mail to going christmas shopping and everywhere in between. They are comfortable warm and very practicle. My husband is looking into getting the mens verson of the same soon. Would highly!!!!!! reccomend.
334991,1,"These shoes are incredibly comfortable. One of the few shoes I've ever purchased that I can stand in them all day, and not complain about my feet hurting. It was a great buy, and the quality is excellent. Highly recommended."
267623,1,"Great boot wear like sneakers but are tough and waterproof never had such a great pair of boots. I wear them daily and they never let me down,just a great product"
388935,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
101630,1,"i purchased the pink glitter heels. i was SO happy when i got them, they look really good and are VERY glittery!!! i got them for a halloween costume. i would recommend them for anyone that has pink in their costume. they are suprisingly comfortable and easy to walk in. WAY HOT!!!!!!!!!!!"
266983,1,"These boots are even better than I had hoped. I bought them for a gift, and he absolutely LOVED them!! They shipped super fast and were true to size. He put them on out of the box and said they fit like they were made for him. I couldn't be happier."
131147,1,"I tried a number of those ""duck shoes"" you see everywhere, even the well built L.L. Bean shoes. They just didn't fit right. I purchased these but was a bit skeptical, however, to my surprise, these rubber overshoe protectors are very versatile. Thick & tough enough against the elements, yet pliable to get over a shoe. I certainly wouldn't hike on rocky trails with these, but I was impressed. Nice about these, I could take them off with relative ease if going into a house and not worry about tracking in dirt and grime. Easy to clean and store in my truck tool box. I am between a 10.5 and 11, so the extra large was perfect."
226601,1,It is exactly as described on the post. I'm very pleased and I highly recommend the product if you like converse products of course
323798,1,"Having found these shoes on-line and taking the ""risk"" of ordering (you know how sometimes shoes are not the right fit and mail-order can be tricky?). The result: the most comfortable pair of shoes I can remember owning in my 60+ years. I will soon buy a second pair and highly recommend these shoes. When they say XW they mean it...at least EEE."
312152,1,I was just looking on-line for a new pair of docs. I love love this shoe. I'm probably getting on average - every 4 years get a new pair of docs. I basically just wear one shoe - and this one is it. After the first week - this shoe is worn to fit 'you' which is great and comfy. Another perk of docs.So I've gotten this particular shoe - 3 times! I gotta still give it raves... but my hubby wants me to get a different style. I won't get anything now but docs. Why a different style? Well - I just had a baby recently - and most of the leggings and stuff I wear - well - is black - and my docs have ALWAYS been brown. You know - to go with a great pair of khaki's! I wonder if he'll notice if I get the same shoe - but in black! ;-)
356861,1,"I searched all over for red sneakers, and boy, was RED hard to find! Didn't find them in any store, so was very pleased to find them online. Amazon had the best price of any online location. Sneakers are very cute and comfy -- as Keds always are. Fit true to size. Very happy with my purchase."
190566,1,"I got these for my mom a couple weeks ago and she can't stop talking about them. She has been looking for shoes that don't hurt her feet (she walks CONSTANTLY) and that support her back (her doctor recommended New Balance 800 or higher).When I found these for such a good price at 1023, I immediately sent her a pair and she's finally found a pair that covers all her needs. Her feet don't hurt, they have plenty of room, and her back doesn't hurt like it usually does. She and I both rate these very high!"
336752,1,"I finally bought my pair this summer and fell in love with them. I've been wanting these boots since last year. I tried on the pink and they are cut smaller than the black and brown, about an half size smaller. The brown and black seems true to size to me and I wear a size 10. You be the judge!"
260675,1,very good product I recommend it to everyone I came perfectly and has no sign of damage apart is very good product!
327870,1,These wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price. And they were delivered faster than expected.
2820,1,"This will fix shoes with rubber/plastic soles that crack, but are still serviceable otherwise. Just fill it in with the Goo - it's like new."
209733,1,"I've had a few pairs of Ariat boots over the years. These are just as well made as my others. The soles are soft, flexible and much more comfortable than traditional leather-soled boots. The leather uppers are substantial and durable, yet supple and comforming to your foot. In my experience, Ariats tend to run about 1/2 size small, so I order 1/2 size larger than I normally wear. If you are looking for a nice boot for casual or work wear, you'd be hard-pressed to find one more comfortable than these."
308960,0,I purchased a couple pair of shoes for my daughter's wedding. This shoe was not true to size. It was a nice looking shoe but itt was too large so I'm going to return it.
105830,1,"I love these shoes and have owned many Chuck Taylor Converse shoes for 30 years. I did forget that when getting this shoe I must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size. This can be frustrating when ordering shoes online, so don't forget to order 1size down :)"
7422,1,The shoes might not look comfortable in the pictures but it is comfortable on your feet. Sleek look!!
323470,1,"these were exactly what i expected shipping was good ,price is less than what it worth,finishing is high quality.i wish there were more colors"
301208,1,"These boots were sold out everwhere I was happy that I found them online at a cheaper price, and they arrived on time"
139261,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
174586,2,"A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain. The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank, and the Tigertooth does not. I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe.By the way, I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia. The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake. The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking. I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it."
322394,0,I purchased these shoes for my 10 year old daughter. The leather is very good however the cut is very small and therefore does not fit.
205551,1,"I got this shoes in a store in yellow, gold and black animal prints. It looks classy, beautiful and expensive. A little painful on the small toes, but overall wearable. Slingback fits properly. It can be worn with anything and it always looks appropriate. I will surely recommend it. It does not get 5 stars becos of comfort. You may have to sit down after some hours, but I am o.k with that !!!"
188729,1,This is my second pair. The tops outlast the bottoms but they are good quality. I have a c width foot so they are good for me. Everyone likes different sneakers for fit and quality. These are made well and will last about a year of daily use. I am satified with them and will keep buying them. Rob
346189,1,"We have an adopted daughter that lives in Spain. We purchased these Converse shoes for her. When she visited us in Canada she was looking for a pair of black converse. At the moment that my husband and I saw them we purchased and sent to her immediately. She has been such a pleasure in our lives and a ""Big Sister"" to our daughter. We have heard from her since she has received them and she loves them.As for service from Amazon and Last Pairs, very prompt and professional. Thank you for making Olga's ""special gift"" a memory for all of us."
136474,1,"I got mine from a Converse store in a mall near St Louis for $20. I've had them for 2 and a half years and have worn them everywhere. I ran a 10 minute Mile and a half in them twice for my Air Force PT Test. I've worn them in Iraq, Kuwait, Arizona, Florida, Washington. they are a part of me. Truly an epic shoe. They're also a great driving shoe, with a nice rolled heel after some wear, and great pedal feel. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice all around, everyday shoe."
296042,1,Bought these for my weekly heights at Mt.Baldy In CA works well in icy slopes not too difficult to put on but you definitely need some thumb strength to put these on your boots. they Bend easily which makes it great to stuff in your backpack. It will even fit in your pocket if you bundle it up correctly. I have been using mine for a year and a half and they still work great
84180,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
9318,2,"Even though I ordered my normal size, these shoes pinched my toes painfully. I ended up throwing them in a donation box."
139553,1,"At first I ordered an 8.5 and they were too big but i was nervous about exchanging them cause i didn't want to get charged twice. but i went for it anyways to try to get an 8 and they fit perfectly and I got refunded on the shipping of the previous pair that didn't fit (and obviously didn't have to pay for the shoes again cause it was an exchange with the same vender). bottom line: definitely worth it and if you need a smaller or bigger size, definitely take the time to exchange. super easy!"
165681,1,I love these shoes! They added to my new years eve outfit. I'm soo glad that I used amazon.com to find them. Took me a long time of looking to finally find these shoes and at a great price.
72111,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
248352,1,"Great boots,waterproof,attractive,fit true to size,highly recommended. Looks identical to photo,genuine Timberland boots. Great on rainy days,clean up well. Identical to the man's version of this boot."
109692,1,"This shoe is a beautiful color and is a true fit shoe,very very comfortable. Would certainly recommend it for all day walking,"
144979,1,"These are wonderfully warm and comfortable boots that really last. I got these boots when they first came out and there was a mad rush to buy every time they were in the stores. Guess what? The early adopters like me are still buying these boots when the furor's not quite as hot as it once was.So--how are my Uggs Classics holding up? On the outside, they still look good as new. The sheepskin insole is felting at the toes, but for less than $[...], I can get a new insole.These are great boots and like me, you will probably keep them as favorites for years. Yes, I add a new pair of Uggs to my closet every year. I initially balked at the price, but these boots honestly have held up a lot better than many other shoes I've had and they're the most comfortable thing around for people with cold feet!Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"
236427,1,"These shoes are so cool, especially for the price, but, the color on the Rust is lighter than what it appears in the photos. They are pretty comfy but really really really high!"
323170,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
168848,1,I just ordered these today but did not hesitate with this purchase as I have ordered this brand of shoes through Amazon before. The fit is true to size. I love that they are available in wider widths and I can wear them all day long without my feet hurting. I will wear these after work and on weekends but the others I purchased were for work and I wear them frequently because they are so comfortable.
332050,1,"I recommend it 100%, I get no problems, the desired model and the perfect size, really the products are excellent and very good quality, I've bought several times"
218268,1,Love 'em and they arrived super fast! They are very comfortable even though they're chucks! Definitely going to order them in more colors!
108017,1,"I just re-purchase that shoes, around yr ago, i bought the white color speers, when I found out is discount item, I re-purchase another pair (Black/gold). That is a comfortable, cool shoes.Just for your information, I am working in HK. It's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here. I need to purchase online and ship to HK. (Takes 14 days). So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player. That is 100% good choice. (Try it... Very Good Deal)Excuse me! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes?"
54679,1,"This is the only way to shop!! The shoes were great, they fit, and we had them in a couple of days!! I could not find these red Keds in any stores near us so I went to Amazon and found them in seconds. We had them so quick-I was shocked!!! Thanks Amazon!!"
196713,1,This bag worked great. I made an iron on picture of my boys and put it on the front. I gave it to their grandparents. Turned out great- and the grandparents loved it. thanks so much!
100566,1,"This is the 3rd pair of birkenstok sandals I own and love this style, it's comfortable and I can wear it all day."
217623,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
73003,1,"I love them, they were here earlier then expected. Right size, Right color. Right everything....I highly recommend."
357783,0,"I got the shoes for a musical I'm in. The sizing is definitely weird. My street shoe size is usually a 9 or 9.5, so I ordered 9, 9.5, and 10. I also have pretty wide feet. Turns out the 9.5 fits fine and I had nothing to worry about. The ball of the foot area is REALLLL snug though, and I ordered the wide size. Hopefully they stretch out with wear."
220040,1,"I can always get my narrow in width size - and the clean lines are perfect for all my casual needs. Mainly, though the size and width is perfect for me."
101019,1,"El producto llego rapido, la calidad del producto llego en perfectas condicionse. Estoy muy contenta del servicio y definitivamente volveria a usar el servicio...Gracias!!!"
155605,0,"This is a nice looking shoe. The leather shine lasts well and looks good. Inside the shoe, the lining has already started curling up after only a few weeks of wear. The sole is made of cheap rubber/plastic materials. But it is too early to say how long the sole will last."
13825,0,dear sirplease send for me catalog and prices sport equipment.thank youb-aghazadeh
54064,1,"I love love love these shoes! I have wide feet, and sometimes it's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet, but these shoes are so perfect! I think I will buy a pair in every color now!"
331952,1,"I'm updating my reviews on this product, because I think I got a little carried away before. My previous review stated that people who were complaining about the width of these things were Bigfoot. I have a wide foot myself, and their complaints caused me to order a size vastly larger than I needed, and I still feel that that's true. These people must have freak-feet. But the fact of the matter is, after I returned the Crocs from Shoebuy for a refund, I went out to a physical store to try on some Crocs. As it turned out, not only were the Crocs that were my size wide enough, but I could actually wear a size down. I usually wear a 10, and I ended up buying a 9. This NEVER EVER EVER happens to me. I could have worn the Crocs which were my size easily enough, but I preferred the 9's, which were a nice, firm fit. I also intended them as house shoes, and will not be using the heel strap. The heel strap actually does make my toe hit the front a bit uncomfortably, but as I said- I won't use them. I only tested that out for the sake of sizing evaluation.So, the long and short of it is that I wouldSERIOUSLY RECOMMEND GETTING THE SIZE YOU WEARIf you have a wide foot, and it is generally the case that you can buy a shoe labeled ""wide width"", you DO NOT need to scale up for Crocs. Crocs in this design will EASILY fit wide width feet.As far as this seller goes, Shoebuy's customer service was good, and when I need a new pair, I am sure I will simply order from them."
371188,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
71798,1,"I found these boots in a discount store and was instantly drawn to them: while the upper is stretch/neoprene(?), it has the look of leather with fine stitching. As an attorney, I needed something that would look great in court, but could be worn in the winter--most ""fancy"" boots are slick on the bottom. These boots were perfect--dressy and look more expensive then they are, stretch to fit, and have incredible traction to keep me from falling on my butt in the court parking lot. Fantastic!"
272240,1,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
58481,1,"This is the only way to shop!! The shoes were great, they fit, and we had them in a couple of days!! I could not find these red Keds in any stores near us so I went to Amazon and found them in seconds. We had them so quick-I was shocked!!! Thanks Amazon!!"
228707,1,"Got these for our 15 year old son. He wears them with a pair of dark rinse skinny levi jeans, leather studded punk belt and a tee. Gotta have these shoes to get that ""rocker"" look. Only con about the shoe is that within a couple of weeks, one of the metal eyelets(for ventilation) on the side of the shoe fell off. However, the insole is thicker and cushiony compared to other cheaper knockoffs, like at Walmart. Anyhow, our son loves them and would give a 5 star rating, but I gave a 4 star rating for quality."
382441,1,Excellent quality and super comfort. Also the water goes through the shoe and does not make the shoe heavy. I am pleased I found this offer to use for my aquatic aerobic class.
113310,0,Just arrived and best described as a slipper.No separate insole or structure. The soles are very narrow so the upper in the D width must hang over the edge. I have been wearing deerskin moccasins for 50 years or so. The quality seems to be going downhill.
109375,1,"I love these shoes and have owned many Chuck Taylor Converse shoes for 30 years. I did forget that when getting this shoe I must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size. This can be frustrating when ordering shoes online, so don't forget to order 1size down :)"
246503,1,Shoes arrived quicker than expected.They fit true to size and were comfortablefrom the beginning. Great shoe!
183167,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
209927,1,Fit is very snug and comfortable. Shoe is light weight a lot like HiTecbrand shoes. Great for walking.
70237,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
317727,1,"PROS: I love the price of crocs, plus they are just all around easy! Easy to wear, easy for toddlers to take on/off, easy to clean, easy to coordinate with everything. We live in Florida and I needed a 'water' shoe, summer shoe, and go-everywhere shoe.CONS: No 'in-between' stage shoe...My 11 month-old has wide chubby feet, the 4/5 were too tight and the 6/7 were just too big. So I ended up buying a $45 Keene shoe in size 5. He grew out of them in 30-days-time...so I bought the $20 Crocs in 6/7 and he's now 13 months old and loves love loves them."
307981,1,I like these shoes very much. The order came and it was quite quick. The tan color is very attractive. These are great for walking for exercise or just walking through the day. I am looking to buy another pair!
354686,1,"These shoes fit me just fine. Of course I had to buy it one size down which is typical for converse shoes, but otherwise I have nothing to complain about."
95199,1,"I got them for $47 + shipping, I thought it was a fair deal since they normally cost $70+. They look and feel nice, hope the durability of the product is the same."
360026,1,"I bought these as choral performance shoes. The wide width is generous and very comfortable and I would definitely recommend to buy a size up. These shoes are extremely supple, comfortable and well made. I especially love the notch above the heel; it prevents the shoe from irritating the back of the achilles tendon."
163994,1,"Got mine today and I love it! I got it in saddle which is really nice color. The size is just right, not oversized but has plenty of room for my stuff. The quality is great, like the details and the soft touch. Great buy!"
305329,1,I've always liked Rockport shoes and was happy to find this pair which fit nicely and are quite comfortable. Shipping was fast and shoes were well packaged. I'd be happy to buy more!
75296,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
86898,2,"Good looking shoes, but...after just 1 month,the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends. The shoe still looks perfect, but I had to use shoe goo to fix it. Seems like for the price, and for as long as this style has been around it shouldn't so this?!"
229862,1,"These are my favorite sneakers. I usually own two pair at any given time. They're great shoes for casual wear, work outs, I've even been complemented on them at some swanky benefits and social events. Sambas are classics, and I'll probably be wearing them for a long time."
295418,0,"Have used several pair of Yaktraxs on Sorels in ski areas. They work well on ice and frozen ground as intended. However the wound coils quickly wear out, break and start catching on carpet, floor mats and any other soft materials. They certainly provide walking safety and are great for occasional use before they wear out"
23881,1,"I bought a size 12 in these, since I usually wear 11.5 or 12 in most everything. These fit very well, not too snug and not loose at all. They are very soft and comfortable and well worth the price. The quality seems to be very durable. I would definitely recommend these to anyone and I will probably buy another pair in a different color soon."
289829,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. The leather is soft and pliable. Buy these shoes!
53751,0,Not as red as pictured. Overall I'm ok with the item but keep in mind that the colors are not as vibrant as pictured.
29530,1,"Simple - descent looking though and light weight, these were the only things I expected from this shoe and that is exactly what I got. In fact it looks much nicer than in the picture.Some things I noticed and thought should be mentioned:- It has a nice sole that gives you a bit more of height too.- I got the grey one, the blue sole seems more prominent in the picture but it is not that much in real."
14103,1,Comfortable and Warm!! Slippers are enjoyable to wear even during &#34;break-in&#34; time. Great job producing something that not only feels good but looks great too!
214341,0,Has anyone had them smell like a skunk? I got them wore them onelce withvsock for an hour and kept smelling something awful I get home and hubby says something smells and I figure out its the dang boots. I'm so sad because they look and feel great. But will the smell go away or is mine the.onyl ones that had the issue?
242947,2,"As an avid gardener and also a fan of Propet shoes which offer sizes in Wide width, I was looking forward to the wash and wear feature. However, just one look right out of the box and the constricting feel in putting them on, I immediately repacked and returned them."
324808,1,I know these aren't football shoes - but they work perfect for flag football with friends.
320992,1,"I loved it, i dance for my church and these go with everythingTheyre confy and cute should def buy it"
96877,1,"Loved them, but sent them back , because they are too narrow. I would keep them, but after 10 minutes of wearing them home, I felt pain, very sorry because they are so classy and nice."
106377,1,"I bougth it for my 23 years old son, he told me they are great and they are so comftable."
1811,0,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
66235,0,"These shoes are really cute, I get compliments on them all the time . They are perfect for wearing to work because technically they are sneakers but they really are too ""formal looking"" for their secret to be revealed :)However, I have been wearing them for about a month and I have found two problems: 1) The back of the left shoe really cuts into my heel, making it somewhat raw and red if I walk around in these shoes all day (not heavy duty walking, just walking around in the office). 2) THEY SMELLLLLL!!!!!! I am really surprised no one has mentioned this yet. They do not breathe at ALL so they (and your feet) end up stinking so badly that it's embarrassing. I never have foot odor problems with any other shoes except for these. I can even smell how bad they are if I'm sitting at my desk with my foot (yes the shoes are on) crossed over my knee... Because of these two issues, I'm not sure I would have bought them in the first place... I still wear them occasionally simply because they are so cute, but honestly it is a sacrifice to do so!**Update - After reading some other reviews/comments on here, one reviewer suggested getting the Hue ""hidden"" liner cotton socks, so i went and bought some today to wear with these, and it makes the whole smell/sweat thing MUCH better... yay!"
266834,1,So far I'm very happy with my boots.They fit well and seem very well constructed.Time wiill tell how they perform but so far so good.
158550,1,This is a must buy item. I owned a pair of docs during my adolescence and I always wanted to purchase another pair but never got around to it. They are a great fit and they now have side zippers!
163520,1,"I've bought this style shoe over & over for years for all day comfort. Also having osteoporois, I feel safe from falls. And appearance is important, too, of course. #1 all the way!"
181186,0,"Hi, we purchase clothing and shoes from all over the world and only the US is significantly different.The US sizes are much smaller and this was not obvious on this web site.Other retailers around the world advise which sizing range is used, including some via Amazon.Or, they clearly marked which country sizing they were using.It should be clear on the website which sizing the retailer is using.On the plus side, the shoes were delivered as ordered, on time and in good condition.RussellAustralia"
238207,1,"Great boots and from my experience I can say get them in the size you normally wear. I wear size 12. However initially, I got them in size 11 but were too small."
183151,1,"My son was thrilled to find these Tims at this unbelievably low price. Amazon shipping was prompt as always, and the fit was perfect."
24254,1,"I am a very frugal, diligent, and meticulous shopper but I really love these boots. Some reviews complain about the amount of space in the calf area but they were fine for me. People, be more aware of your body types and stop blaming perfectly good products! If you have thicker calf muscles, you obviously require a different style boot lol.Yes, they squeak at little at first but a little baby oil stops that. The baby oil also helps hide scuff marks.I really enjoy these boots and have received many compliments. I wear them with skirts, leggings, skinny jeans- you name it. Do order one size up if you're using them for cold weather footwear :)"
190043,1,I've bought my daughter probably 5 pairs of these shoes over the years and she loves them. This is the cheapest I've ever paid so that made it that much better.
12847,1,The butterfly is so cute! It's nice to have something distinguishing without having to get a crazy color. I use these shoes for powerlifting as well as everyday wear. I visited the seller's website and they have a pretty large variety of designs. Would like to see some in kids' sizes but I couldn't be happier with my new Chucks!
184642,0,"I ordered these for my 8 year old son. He was so excited he took them out of the box and tried to put them on only to discover that we were sent two left shoes. Now I am stuck with two left feet. Need to order a second pair, they say only one pair left in his size 4.5, must be two right shoes."
87249,1,I bought the Eurelle Slippers for my husband's birthday. They arrived quicker than I expected. He loves them and wears them every day.
27133,1,"These shoes arrived quicker than I imagined (next day, when I only have prime 2-day shipping), and fit great. They are comfortable, and they are still great today, 2 months later. The only problem is that the shoes aren't the same color as the ones in the picture. The picture depicts it as a whiter shade, while in reality they are much browner. But don't let the color difference mislead you - these shoes are well worth the money."
65653,1,My kid is in heaven with these new kicks! He wears them with every outfit. They look great on him too. Thanks.
103490,1,"love these boots, and love amazon's better pricing! the boots got here just in time for family christmas pictures!!"
48792,1,This shoe holds up well under my 210 pound frame. The shoe also supports my orthotics well and fits perfectly (I am actually about a size 12 1/2). I still think this is the best heavy duty shoe for the money.
311698,1,I had a pair of these stolen while returning from a cruise. I am so happy to have a new pair. They are my favorite shoes.
245243,1,"My brother in law has been buying these shoes for quite a long time their one of his favorites. However, right now he is having trouble breaking them in and getting blisters. He says by next week they will probably be a 5 star item though. Overall I,m happy with the item I got for him for christmas"
335738,1,"There is no doubt about the quality from Sperry, you buy any design or any style but quality remains the best. I have not seen any brand having such excellent quality. I would say people who look for quality, long life as well as long term satisfaction, would love to buy Sperry."
242167,1,"Just what you would expect if you owned a pair of these 10, 20, 30 years ago, except with a custom peace sign logo on the outside only.They do sure highlight however just how far shoe technology has come by comparison to a pair of ASICS running shoes - in terms of support, comfort etc. They are 30 year old or more shoe technology.I hoped that logo would be on both sides but the inseam side of the shoe bears the traditional converse chuck taylor logo.Still, 5 stars from my view. They are what they are supposed to be."
16055,1,I have been wearing this Propet Walking Shoe for several years. It has held up very well and is extememly comfortable. I need to replace them and could not find them locally. I went on line to Amazon and found just what I was looking for. I have feet problems and these have been a Godsend. They look nice with slacks and a nice blouse or with jeans and casual shirts. I love them.
152069,1,I own five pairs of these shoes. All different colors. They are the most comfortable shoe I own. I am a plus size person and I can shop all day in these shoes without pain or fatigue. I wear them year round with or without socks. The best thing is I can wash them in my washing machine. I usually wash them with a load of towels. Take the insoles out first. I wouldn't wash the patent look shoe in the machine since it might damage the shiny parts. I am now looking for a good buy on the fur lined winter shoes. I highly recommend them.
128318,1,"they are a perfect fit for my foot, and they are very durable. they are a decent looking all around shoe. ariat my favorite"
273898,1,"These boots seem to be very well made, and I have yet to slip on ice due to the super grippy soles. Of course, they look awesome.However, I bought the smallest size that Demonia makes (6), and they are too big all around. I'm generally a size 6, sometimes 5 1/2, but these feel closer to a 7 or 8 (I can't make my toes touch the end even if I try). Also, the boots stay up because they are stiff, but they are also loose on my calves and ankles. These are not designed for small and slender people."
344472,0,"These shoes look really nice but they do seem too narrow and are just too snug all the way around. I wear a size 8 medium. I will need to return them but not sure if a larger size will work as then they will be too long and still too narrow probably. My foot is wide at the toes and narrow at the heel so that in itself is an issue on most of my shoes. The shoes also feel like they slant towards the inside, which would not be good for walking very far. Even when I am just looking at them when they are not on I see how they slant inwards a little, or at least to me that is what I see."
1339,1,"Certainly the best pair of hiking shoes I've ever had (I haven't had too many).The shoes are perfect for what they were made, they really are waterproof, they are quite comfortable, reliable and look nice.Points to improve: waterproofing, for showing your friends it's ok, but for real hiking... well, it can be improved."
293939,1,"I knew I'd made the right choice the minute I put them on. They feel like shoes made by craftsmen. Within seconds I was climbing higher on the boulder than I wanted to go-- that's how much difference they made (o.k-- I'm comparing them to climbing in running shoes!) The other point worth making is that my feet stayed comfortable while climbing.Maybe the most telling comment I can make is this one. I ran into another climber with the same shoes. When I asked him if he liked them, his face lit up. And then all the other climbers (all wearing other brands) joined in the conversation-- everyone agreed that La Sportiva Mythos was the best."
80718,1,"These shoes are worn very regularly by most of my family for nearly barefoot comfort. We like the colors and the look of them. I like the pink ones, because when I was a kid my mother told me I could be invisible in pink sneakers. I have 2 pairs of the high tops, one pair is 5 years old and while they are limp and a bit faded, the soles are still in decent condition. I also have a pair of the oxfords in raspberry rose which is just a fantastic pink color, and doesn't seem to be fading fast. My daughter loves her Skydiver Blue pair.They don't offer any support and they do run large. But as long as you aren't doing a lot of walking, they are very comfortable and light weight. I use my oxfords as slip ons with the laces tied a bit loose."
154039,1,I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my sister. She put them on as soon as she opened them and didn't want to take them off. She loved them.
302212,1,"great sneakers! look great and fit perfectly. can wear with anything!the best for skydiving :)will definitely buy again, maybe different colors.thank you."
174759,1,"Not as comfortable as the Grenada--my all-time favorite Eastland and, in fact, favorite shoe--but reasonably comfortable for a long day. If I'm on my feet for more than four hours, it starts to hurt."
189803,1,I've been buying for 5 yrs and now am buying for &#1084;&#776;&#804;&#775;&#803;&#818;&#803;y sister for school !! Very strong shoe good quality everything!!!
175429,0,"Cute shoes, but when I tried on my size (7.5), they didn't fit. I probably needed a 7. Didn't have arch support either. Had to return them."
228883,1,These are such nice looking shoes. Different than anything that I have seen. They are dressier than tennis shoes so they go great with everything. The only thing is that the size runs slightly big and we were having a difficult time getting them on. I don't know if that would have gotten easier as they were worn more or not. We ended up having to return them and I am still looking for something as cute.
246610,1,"I ordered this shoe with some hesitation. Bostonian's are normally not this cheap!The shoes came quicker than I expected, and the shoes are fantastic. Thanks!"
334812,1,"It usually takes me about 3 weeks before new shoes stop hurting my feet. These are breaking in nicely in about 1 week. Great quality, comfort. Highly Recommended!"
247265,1,"Warm and soft, very comfortable and yet solid soles, just the right size and arrived promptly. Will certainly trust this vendor. Highly recommended."
30071,1,I had my old pair for about 6 years. I was so happy to find them again. By far these are the best shoes to stand in for 8+ hours straight. My heels normally are killing me after 4 hours these last 8. So there's nothing i can complain about.
224709,1,"Was very thankful these arrived so soon after ordering,was a last minute item...and my daughter loves them....she now has 2 pairs..and is planning on collecting them for different colors....Thank youShelia Sale/VA"
341217,1,"I've been purchasing this brand of athletic shoe for years. I stay with them because they are quality shoes that last. I've purchased them online before from Reebok's website. This is my first time buying them through Amazon and I'm very satisfied. Not only were they delivered on time, they were actually less expensive than buying them directly from Reebok. You can bet that the next time I need to buy new Reebok's I'll start at Amazon.com"
367194,1,I have been using this to dry my kids gloves this winter. It works AWESOME!!! I tried to put them in the dryer and the fingers of the gloves never seemed to get dry. Within an hour they are dry with this product. Would definitely recommend!!
121071,1,Great looking western style leather slippers - beachy with a south-western flair. Comfortable. stylish and made to last a very very long time.
241168,1,"very good purchase for my daughter, she had a pair before and she wouldn't take them off unless she went to sleep so they worn out in almost 3 years, so i got this new pair for her for xmas, i'm sure she's gonna love them.perfect sizing and quality."
3176,1,"Excellent hiking or everyday boot.Extremely good value and fit.Hardly any ""breakin"" required.I would definitely recommend these for anyone interested in a hard wearing boot,for the money."
376456,1,"Bought for my son, who is into outdoors and camo things. Wallet received in great condition and is working great...he just loved it. Recommend you get this for your hunter or camo lover for sure."
385687,1,my feet grew during my pregnancy and these were the cutest shoes on my size 11 feet! not easy to find that! i bought the silver ones and just adore them and get compliments on them. they are roomy for my feet. i can wear them with or without socks. i love wearing them in my garden and they are super easy on and off!
310559,1,"These shoes are great for skating, the soles of the shoe have a nice flat bottom with thick rubber that gives a solid feel on the deck of the skateboard with padding on the inside. I skate ditches a few times a week and can usually get a few months out of a pair of these shoes before wearing holes in the soles of the shoes."
317117,1,While I've always been a 608 fan the last ten years or so I was tempted to try the 609 model out. Very comparable in design and quality but it does appear they have ramped back a bit. Still all leather (assuming) upper and comfortable sole but the logo and some stitching has been sacrificed. I wear my sneakers to work as well as play and the 608 would give me a solid year and a half of daily abuse before needing replacement. I'll give the 609 a year at best. New Balance makes a decent shoe for the $$. I've paid more for less for sure.
267179,1,"I bought these a couple months ago and immediately put them to use by going hiking through streams and climbing mountains and boulders. I was surprised how amazing well these shoes work. They have great grip on rock and the solid sturdy frame holds your foot in place even on uneven rocks and boulders. These boots are 100 times better than the Merrell Boab which are very flimsy and quite a bit more expensive. These boots also would make great winter boots as the waterproofing is fantastic. The insoles have fantastic arch supports so these boots are really great for someone like me who has high arches.Cons: Although the grip is great on rock it is not so great on water covered rocks. But I guess that is the case with all boots. These boots need some getting used to so I would wear them and walk around the city and change the way you tie the lases and how far up you tie them and just play around until you get a comfortable fit. The boots has a significant volume so if your foot volume is small like me then you will need to use padded insoles like superfeet.Also, these boots can get really warm in summer but that turns into a pro quality in winter.I would highly highly recommend these Bootz especially for a person with high arches."
200091,1,I have gone through several shoes over the years. I finally went to a specialty shop for advice and to get fitted. I tried on 5 pair and ended up with the Grid Omni. The shoe is very stable and has eliminated any of the lingering aches and pains that I had experienced with the other shoes I have tried. I highly recommend them.
187374,1,"These are my second pair of UGGs and just like the first pair, they did not disappoint! They are very warm and comfortable. They are a perfect fit! I had them in 2 days which is GREAT! I will definitely return when I'm interested in another pair!"
322360,2,"I have an older pair of rockport suede oxfords and they are one of my favorite pair of shoes. When I got these (took forever) I was very disappointed with the quality, they seemed very stiff and overall just a much cheaper looking and feeling product than what I am used to from rockport."
240321,1,"OUTSTANDING! it's a happy day when my mom can actually find a shoe to fit her comfortably and at such a low price. She loves the color and comfort. Fast, excellent shipping."
78487,1,"Shoes arrived in wonderful shape; packaged well; exactly what I ordered.However, we ordered the wrong size. Return went well; advised my account would be credited for purchase price only; but there was no stock available nor could they tell me when they would receive more in the size we needed. If you need a specific size, order it ASAP."
19442,1,Actually have them on right now!! nice and comfy but lightweight...have already washed them and they wash perfectly...definitely recommend!! I wear a size 8 shoe and purchased the large and the fit is perfect..
305961,1,"While I'm not a runner, I bought these on advice from others that have to walk on concrete as part of their job. The anti roll and cushion soles are the best support I've had for my feet in a long time. I ended up buying a second pair, one set for work, and the other for home and biking.You can't go wrong with this shoe, not to mention you can get them in 4E widths!maloy"
319448,1,The shoes seem to be a good quality. They have nice coloring & very supple. I would recommend these shoes for anyone needing ballet shoes.
323442,1,This is great pair of sneakers for walking or running. I prefer walking. They are stylish and go great with a pair of black or blue jeans. Plus the sole looks durable.
234675,1,"I received these shoes last week. Aside from the usual break in period (stiffness), these shoes didn't take long to soften up. My heels usually take a beating when I walk the golf course. After my first round of golf wearing these shoes, my heels felt fine and no pain in the usual areas."
82257,0,"I am a size 7.5 and ordered these in size 7, as most people that bought them claimed they ran big. They are indeed very comfortable...if you are not in the middle of sizes. The 7's were *just slightly* small...just so that you can't tell until you've walked a little and your feet keep slipping out of them. I know 8's will be too big, as these were nearly there, but not quite."
58943,1,"Perfect condition, but just a little thing.I Selected the Black ones (which have the black and silver picture) but came whole black. Please refresh the pictures of the black selection to avoid future mistakes.Thanks :)"
131151,1,"These overshoes protect your feet much better than Tingley Trims, and they are less likely to tear. However, they do look kind of silly.Tingley used to produce a high top overshoe that is not so wide by the toe. But, I haven't been able to find them the last few years."
143824,1,Lovely shoes! Sturdy and so sexxy... I would highly recommend. Of course a shoe of this height is not for the faint of heart
136870,1,"The black Chuck Taylor's are a must have classic for the shoe lover. I own two pairs of them myself, and would never buy anyother shoe. Why? They're so comfortable and match EVERYTHING!"
153527,1,"Although most people don't need them, the ties are great for me, because I have high arches and wide feet."
315530,1,"I bought this pair of shoes for my son. They fit well (he has a wide foot), are comfortable to wear, look very handsome on him. He has only worn them for about two weeks, so I don't know about overall wear longevity."
238081,1,"I bought these boots mostly for snowshoeing this winter. I did wear them on a motorcycle color ride up here in the northwoods when it was in the low 30's one morning. My feet were happy, never cold and comfortable all day long. Walking around they were very comfortable. Now the real test will be when snow comes. I am sure that I will like them for snowshoeing. How can you not, ""There Keen's"" I own 6 or 7 differnt pair of Keen. I really like them all and would continue to buy them. In my opinion, they are the most comfortable, funtional shoes you can buy and they look good too!"
216170,0,"As nice as the flip-flops are, the biggest problem is they were not made for wide feet. The color, style, and construction are good. They are pretty, but completely inadequate -- unless someone has a flip-flop stretcher so they will accommodate a slightly wider than narrow foot."
203052,1,My elderly mother has bunions and hammers toes. She likes a little heel and these are perfect for her. This is the third pair she gets. These are also VERY durable.
350199,1,"I need a dress shoes without heels due to a bad back. These shoes were sold out at the local shoe, but Amazon saved the day! A perfect fit with soft leather uppers and patent leather toe and heel, goes perfectly with pants or skirts. The very first time I purchased shoes online and it was a success!"
362625,1,"The shoes looks good and are well made, I know how young people like to stay in style and they arrived well in the time frame given."
375725,1,"These shoes are great. Stability when walking. Size/fit are true. I would recommend these shoes for all walkers, but especially for those like me, a senior citizen whose daily exercise is mainly walking. I had purchased a white pair last year and was very pleased with them so I bought these black ones to wear in the winter."
33403,1,"The colors brown and royal blue we ordered were a perfect match to the samples on the page. The only downside is how long these socks are. My 5 and 7 year olds are tall for their age, in 90% percentile, and they came up to mid-thigh on the 5 year old and just above the knee on the 7 year old. They love wearing them, but for hot summer baseball games, we have to roll them down or use different socks. Great price for 3 pairs and shipped quickly."
133759,1,Fit just like recommended on Capezio site. I traced my daughter's foot on a piece of paper and then measured between the two longest points. Dead on for ordering. Great quality!
330138,1,"Nice boots, very comfortable, I like the color, and heel and tip pieces. You can wear these any where any time. I like them for dressing up !"
306980,1,comfortable shoes--perfect because not full of padding and insulation so spring wear in the rains is great
327024,1,"These shoes are pretty much the most comfortable flip flops I've ever worn (I collect flip flops-my collection has over 20). They have amazing arch support, and tends to run a tad bit skinny on the straps, so if your feet are a little wider, you may want to size up."
345884,1,I got these for my son's 14th birthday. He was so excited he threw them on on the spot. He has worn them about a month now and they are still his favorites.
188029,1,"First off I have to say that the sizing is a bit small. I purchased these boots for hunting and walked for miles in them right out of the box with no break in issues. They are completly water proof to within a half inch of the top of the boot. They have great grip in snowy locations and will keep your feet warm with a pair of thermal socks , although under 10 degrees F my feet did start to get chilly while standing in one spot. Haven't had a chance to test them in warm weather yet, so I will update this summer.Great AMERICAN MADE boot."
209771,1,"I've owned a pair of these boots before, great boots! I would have given these boots a five star rating but they were a little smaller in size compared to my previous pair. After wearing these boots for a couple of weeks they have become very comfrontable. The boots I ordered are a beautiful black onyx well made pleasure to wear possibly a four and one half star."
81258,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
265353,1,Had an older pair that lasted for about 6 years. I loved them and sought to replace them with the same model. I got them and they broke in pretty quick. I am happy!
373363,1,"Right out of the box, these are the most comfortable walkers I've ever had. I have arthritis in my knees and these shoes help to stabilize my stride so I can walk farther without pain. I will definitely buy more of these so I can have a pair in each color."
302338,1,This item was a gift. It was received in time for Christmas 2011. received in great condition. The shoes are super comfortable and very stylish. Great buy! 2 thumbs up!
39336,1,"I am not sure why, but these particular shoes are getting rather difficult to find in retail stores in our area. I am on my feet a lot at work and do a lot of walking. For the price, these are probably the most comfortable and long lasting shoe I have ever worn. I have several pair of them because when I do find them, I buy two pair at a time.I must admit to being rather rough on shoes but these things hold up just as well as shoes that I have paid four and five times more for.These shoes give you plenty of toes room and the cushioning is wonderful. I tend to land rather hard on my heels when I walk and the cushion in these shoes is perfect.Of course as the shoes become a bit worn for the work place, they go into my outdoor walking and scrounging around shoe pile; they work wonderfully for that purpose also. The sole is quite even and stable which helps prevent ankle strain or sprain when moving over rough ground. I have one old pair; really, really old and beat-up, which I use for my creek wading. Of course it does take awhile to wear a pair of these out and they clean up quite well using only a damp cloth and a brushing now and then.For the price it is really rather difficult to beat these things.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"
349452,1,"These shoes look awesome. They are a little snug at first but after a ""breaking in"" they feel really light and comfortable. Did I mention they look awesome???"
122127,1,very reasonably priced. My 16 year old loves these shoes. Says they are very comfortable and wants me to get him another pair.
361618,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
348736,1,Excelent quality. Really comfortable and an awesome shipping time.A great G.N.AGoodNiceAffordableNow I ordered another pair for my son.
332368,1,"I am on my 3rd pair of Black and 2nd pair of Brown. I have worn them pretty much every day for the past 7-8 years. The shoe strings are the only thing that have not held up, but that is easily fixed. The sole is not leather, so you do not have to worry about having to constantly have that replaced, if you do alot of walking. I was pleasantly surprised with the value of the shoe offered compared to the price."
211086,1,These are super sexy without being too high. They run a half size big so account for that. They are a soft leather and they wear great!
215627,1,"The quality of this product is generally very good. However,the bottom of the heel came off after three times normal use. I suggest a better bonding to enhanse the quality. Thank you very much."
7575,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
208705,1,"This great outdoor shoes, has a very price-quality relation. Are you loocking for a outdoor shoes ???. Look at that. Confortable and good price."
243067,1,I'm a huge sneaker freak and have to say these shoes are some of my favorites. Comfortable and stylish they look great with my 511 skinny leg jeans. I will always keep a pair of these in my collection.
94388,1,This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
104063,2,A great manufacturer and the world's leader when it comes to clogs. The reason for my poor review is this particular clog features a heel that is lower than the toe. Granted it's probably designed to help your posture but I couldn't get passed the feeling of falling back out of my shoes. You will also realize how flimsy the leather is on these as well. Sent them back.
145505,1,Bought these for my daughter's birthday. She has Raynaud's Syndrome and these are the only boots that keep her feet very warm.
386572,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
265614,1,"The person I purchased them for feel they are very comfortable. I was worried at first with buying boots from on line, but it turned out ok."
197102,1,"I've owned two pair of these shoes over the years and they're wonderful! When you first buy them they will fit very tightly across the top of the foot; they're VERY comfortable to wear right out of the box, just difficult to get on at first but this soon loosens up. Each pair that I have owned has lasted several years with near daily wear with lots of getting wet/muddy & stepping in things at livestock shows that we don't like to think about. They clean right up and are ready to go anywhere. I wear them for everyday, shopping, casual day at the office, feeding livestock, and going to my kids stockshows(LOTS of walking, standing, grooming, etc.) The lighter color doesn't show scuffing as much as the darker color, but the darker color looks better with dark-wash jeans. They're both great, though, and I would highly recommend these to anyone needing long-wearing, comfortable, workhorse-but-still-look-good shoes."
143177,1,"I love these sandals. I think this is my 7th pair! They last for many, many miles and stay comfortable!"
155140,0,Comfortable shoes but they felt a size larger. The color was black yet the strap lining was a light tan color -- I had to take extra time when closing the velcro (folding over the strap) to cover the lighter color.
302721,1,I love these shoes. They are so comfortable and are cushioned so I can walk with a bounce in my step.
316991,1,If you want a great sneaker for walking and everyday use... this is it. Very comfortable and lasts a good long time.
142631,1,Love them! So comfy! I've had Minnetonkas in the past and always thought they were great. I just might be buying some more!
116676,1,"Love them! It's an unknown what you'll actually get when you order online,and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the ballet shoes. Thanks!"
336934,1,These shoes look amazing. They are definitely legit Chuck Taylors. They are worth every penny.
329588,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
74741,1,These sandals are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a long time. I have several pairs in different colors and practically live in them all summer. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a pair of sandals.
349577,0,"The pearl white shoe in the picture looks much more white than real-life. As for the fit, I am going to return them. They run small. I ordered 8 1/2 M, they say 8 1/2 but they are narrow and fit like an 8. There is no way I could walk comfortably in these shoes."
267583,1,First pair lasted a couple of years and served me well; paid a little more for a full leather upper a year ago and these babies still keep my feet warm and dry. Good value boot for the money.
16113,1,"I just re-purchase that shoes, around yr ago, i bought the white color speers, when I found out is discount item, I re-purchase another pair (Black/gold). That is a comfortable, cool shoes.Just for your information, I am working in HK. It's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here. I need to purchase online and ship to HK. (Takes 14 days). So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player. That is 100% good choice. (Try it... Very Good Deal)Excuse me! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes?"
325873,1,"I like the comfortable feel of leather. It has a lot of cushion inside and provides plenty of support. I wear a 14, but needed to go with the 15 for this shoe--runs a little small."
22725,0,"Although this is listed as ""little kids"", the size listed is the adult men's size. I returned the product with no problems. The quality of the product was excellent."
216281,1,"These are excellent shoes, I have had 3 pairs of this exact model. My first pair was recommended by one of the fitting experts at my local running specialty store. The brooks helped my knees considerably. I'm a big guy (6' 248lbs) was (289lbs when I started running) and these shoes provide the necessary support for my weight. I experience no joint pain and much less fatigue running in these shoes. My last two pairs have been from Amazon because I can't resist the great price and having them delivered! :) Do consider getting fitted by an expert at a local running specialty store in your area. An expert will ensure that you have the correct shoe for your gate, pronation, and other technical running criteria. They will also make sure your shoe is the right size. I've taken a few of my running buddies down to the local store and the most common problem with their old shoes was they were too small. So go get a fitting and then when you go to replace the shoe save at amazon!"
183297,1,"If you read my reviews you will find that I like Donald J. Pliner shoes.Beautiful design, beautiful quality, the best leathers. Like all theDonald J Pliners I own --AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA +++++. And they sell at greatprices on Amazon."
319183,0,"I usually wear a 7.5 but in this slipper I need an 8.5. I have slim feet, so even after I pulled the elastic strings as far as they could go, the slipper was still loose around the edges. I was hoping for a comfy slipper, instead I got an ill-fitting mess! I returned them. They might work for some, but they just weren't for me."
205193,1,"I have always loved ""mule"" sneakers (open back) and Skechers has a great variety of them. They are light weight, fit like a glove and very comfortable. I also like the fact I don't have to worry about tying them. My last pair of Skechers lasted for almost 4 years and I still have a pair of Skechers hiking shoes that are 8 years old and still look great. Enjoy!"
27665,1,"i absolutely love these boots! you can ware them with any thing. you can dress up with them, or throw on a pair of jeans &amp; be totally relaxed but styling! i love them. i own the black ones because for me, they go with every thing! thanks..."
306006,1,I have wore them on several occasions and they were comfortable from the very first day. They are lined and the cushioned sole is very comfortable. I would buy another pair for a similar price
363614,1,"These shoes are great for walking, good staple for any wardrobe. The hitops are very secure around my ankles and I like the way they feel when walking around all day. They fit great and just feel very solid. Small scratches and scuff marks come off easily with rubber eraser. I got the package three days before scheduled. No complaints whatsoever."
22989,1,"I happened upon these by chance for a gift for my 13 yo daughter for Christmas. She absolutely loves them! The only problems are that one of the rivets on the inside of the shoe is bent already and pokes her in the foot. Also, one of the peace sign patches is already lifting. I sent an email to amazon but did not have the order # handy. They responded but could not help without the number. I have yet to get back with them which is my fault. Overall, for the length of time that she will fit into these I think they will be ok."
230573,1,One of my favourite adidas shoes.Definitely the best SLIM sneakers around (also talking about colors).
103994,1,i like this website how i can buy shoes and clothings???
145438,1,These are cute. Best boots ever. My wife wears them everywhere. She gets tons of compliments and they go with everything!!
297366,1,"This shoe is pretty comfortable, once you get it on...Don't know if it's just me, but it's a little tight which makes putting it on kinda difficult. Otherwise, great shoe!"
310501,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
82104,2,"CHEAP!DO NOT BUY! Strings in front broke apart when I tried them on for the FIRST time. After only 10 wears, the Backseam ripped down the whole back of the right boot, I had to trash them after only having them for 1 MONTH! This is the WORST product I have EVER purchased! Due to the one month return limit, I could not return them. Hows that for Planned obsolescence!!!"
213379,1,"I've never been much of one for fancy shoes. Sure, I love the way they look, but I end up wearing them once, then stowing them to the ever-growing stash in the bottom of my closet.When I bought this shoe in the blushing bride/heather color last fall from a catalog, I expected another candidate for that stack in my closet. A shoe with the playful, sporty, yet somehow feminine details of this one simply isn't practical...right?Then they came and I tried them on.I hate to admit it, but I am now a Puma athletic shoe addict. Every pair is sporty and trendy, yet has a classical styling that is somehow sophisticated and traditional. They work for me because they're pracitcal enough to go running in, but stylish enough to wear with jeans or a sporty minidress.There's not much else to say. These are the most comfortable cute shoes I've ever had, plain and simple. They are, by far, the most versatile shoes I've ever owned. BUY THEM!"
304310,1,"My son has dropped arch's and severe pronation from fast weight gain from all chemo meds. We went the route of medical orthotics and in grade school all he got was blisters and couldn't walk or any extra activities. We found these shoes and have purchased them ever since. Not only can he walk without pain, he's proud to say he's not last doing the mile run at school!!!!! I greatly recommend these shoes to any one I talk to, they've made a extreme difference in his life!!!!!!!!"
209970,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
216779,1,"Very Fast! I had the item within 2 days of placing the order, color and size correct. I was very pleased with the service."
323458,1,"Received these shoes just TWO days after ordering. Gotta love that. The shoes themselves are great. As soon as I took them out of the box and slipped them on, they fit like a glove. I walked around the house for a short while and they seem to have good cushion & support. Haven't walked around in them long enough to see how they hold up in distance, but they are not ""running"" shoes. These are meant to be just a nice comfortable casual shoe. They look great (I got the black & gray combo), feel great and the price was great. Another great purchase from my favorite place to shop online. Highly recommended."
377477,1,"Went shopping for a pair of slippers after Christmas. Didn't realize that men's slippers are such a seasonal item. There were very few choices available in the stores in January. And the ones that were available were almost all at least $50. Purchased these through Amazon at an excellent price and with Prime delivery they were here in two days.Sizing for slippers is typically a challenge. I wear a size 8.5 to 9 shoe and experience suggests that I needed to order a larger size. (Many slippers come only in S/M/L/XL and oddly enough, I usually require an ""L"" or ""XL."" I can't imagine what men with truly large feet do.) In this case, I ordered a size 10. Out of the box they fit a bit tight (with socks) but I expect them to stretch a bit and will fit perfectly.The materials seem good though I have some concerns about the longevity. (But at the price I paid it's not a big concern.) The tread is excellent. Not too noisy on hardwood floors but grippy enough for going outside in the rainy season in Seattle. (I nearly broke my neck a few times in my last pair of slippers.)All in all an excellent value for less than 20 bucks."
95293,1,Exactly what it said in the description and in excellent quality with a great price. I wear them nearly every day.
289239,1,My Dad has very flat and painful feet. He has had quite a few surgeries on his feet. He says these shoes are so comfortable they are like slippers. That is high praise from him. At 87 comfort is very important to him. I highly recommend these shoes.
78076,1,"I just love my black moccasins! There just like I remembered them back in the day. I wear them all the time and everyone is complimenting them and are reminising about the days when they wore them. Of course, I gave them the website AMAZON.COM. Thanks Amazon.com and Minnetonka.Rubyred"
239282,1,"Most comfortable and good looking classic sneakers on the market for unbeatable price. I have already bought a second pair cause am wearing them everyday. Do not get me wrong, they are durable I just wanna have one dry extra pair for exchange.Be careful with sizes, ezample my regular size is US 11 1/2 for 90% of shoes am wearing, but all Onitsuka shoes fits 1/2 size down som wearing US 11."
123157,1,"Fits to the size. I have always loved skechers and am glad to add these to my collection. Very durable shoe as well. And dont believe the hype that they are a heavy shoe. No way, they are way more comfortable than my N. Balance."
380926,0,Basic dance shoe at a reasonable price. Be sure to order one full size up; I went through 4 pairs to find this out.
365540,1,It is nice to slip in to a new shoe and get the feel of a firm but comfortable fit. Lots of value here for the money.In my size they look like navy gunboats...and I love them!
355229,1,"This is my first pair of Chucks, and I have to say that I am absolutely in love with them. A good looking, comfortable, light shoe that goes with everything - what more could you want?"
319432,1,"lots of comments about size ...so much so that i anticipated having to send them back.here's my advice - don't use the size charts listed because its way off. Do this:get a tape measure - stand on it, measure from the bottom rear of your foot up to the tip of your big toe...then match that with the size next to it... (skip all the US/ EU / GB size... they are clearly wrong on the size listing)So, my daughters measurement was 10"" from back to tip - we ordered size 9. Perfect fit.okay, material quality is nice for wearing around the house or art school... but from what i could tell, it won't stand up to constant use. But hey, they're inexpensive (relatively speaking) so buy a few pair.m"
15800,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
194146,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
146745,1,These are cute. Best boots ever. My wife wears them everywhere. She gets tons of compliments and they go with everything!!
201416,1,I bought these bags to give out to members of a group I facilitate. They are roomy and seem to be durable. Excellent price.
25266,1,"Contenta con la compra, tal cual como se muestra en la imagen, el envi&oacute; eficiente y todo r&aacute;pido, excelente calidad"
292534,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
65655,1,Producto excelente y buen estado entregado a tiempo y en condiciones &oacute;ptimas altamente recomendado el vendedor y con buena credibilidad
318359,0,"These shoes are not correctly sized - they are much smaller than marked, so beware."
318064,1,"So far I am quite happy about this purchase, like the color and style, quite comfortable too, haven't experienced bad weathers yet, don't know whether whether the water will go through it in the rainy weather.. I am glad I chose half a size smaller than my usual size, thanks to the previous comments:)"
334423,1,I bought these in pink cause I thought they would look good with all the gray I have. I have about 4 other pairs of these in other colors.Flexible shoe. Fast shipping and great price
169752,1,"Comfortable, stylish and comes in narrow sizes which are difficult to find in many shoe brands."
73391,0,"Came on time, store did a great job getting my order to me on time.The shoe on the other hand seems to be made more for a man than a women.The strap does not stay forward, if you decide to wear them without the strap in the back.I have an old pair of these crocks and they are just not the same."
21760,1,"They were a gift for my Mother. She likes them. 'Nuff said? (Apparently not, since I had to add this filler.)"
353112,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
110206,1,I bought some of this stuff to cover lots of heavy scuff on the front and back of my leather Ecco shoes. The product is brown in color and is very watery as it comes off the sponge... but it works! Even upon close examination of the shoes most of the scuffs are undetectable and the ones you can see appear to be slightly darker than surrounding leather. But again- that was at a close look- no one could tell unless they were eye to eyelets with your shoes. My only advice is to have paper towels handy due to the watery aspect of the product. But it truly brought new life to my shoes.
183667,1,"My son was thrilled to find these Tims at this unbelievably low price. Amazon shipping was prompt as always, and the fit was perfect."
271555,1,"I was looking for an Easter Gift for the boys since 2 of the 3 have Sugar diabetes, So i found these Converse Men's Team Respect style sneakers. So i bought them for 19.99 and the value was 79.99.Boys were happy and so was I.Great quality also."
134474,1,These shoes are sooooooooooooo cool!!!!!!!! They are so comfortable! They are also very fashionable. They match with anything. I highly recommend these shoes for people with a sence of fashion!
163018,1,"They came in a timely manner, in the little Converse box. They're just as the should be: classic kicks that will last a long time."
174509,1,"The color is more a hot pink than baby pink as shown, but they sure are cute!!! Worth the buy."
337293,1,"I very much liked the shoe, but due to the fact that I have very narrow feet, it didn't fit. Great service ordering through Amazon."
154659,1,"I never thought I would find something like this especially in time for Christmas, thank you so much- they are awesome looking and the recipient will absolutely LOVE them as a Christmas Gift. I will be a returning customer for life."
211002,1,I purchase this sandals for my mother. She likes this sandals because they are very soft and easy to put on. Also the leather is very soft and comfortable.
141874,0,"This might sound weird, but these shoes are too sguishy. When I am taking my daily run, my shoes always hurt because it is too squishy!!"
16056,1,I love these shoes!I have bought them for a couple of years.They were so reasonable at Amazon and delivered promptly.
137834,1,Worn keds my whole life. Still love them. This is my daughters second pair of black. Think it's so cool that as a teenager she wears them.
194640,1,I purchase this sandals for my mother. She likes this sandals because they are very soft and easy to put on. Also the leather is very soft and comfortable.
267140,1,"I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT"
37742,1,These fit my daughters feet perfectly! I bought them a half a size up and they fit like a charm! She has long skinny feet. I am happy when she is happy and she loves them. I was super scared buying a shoe online....we spend forever in shoe stores trying to find shoes that fit. Recently we moved to alaska and there is no department store on our island so I have started shopping online....I am very happy with this shopping experience.
219175,1,"my husband LOVED THESE, shipped fast and just in tiime for christmas will Definitely buy again if needed i recommend these"
85035,0,"I just received these roday and I ordered them a whole size larger than my fit, they run very small because they are still too snug.I have had them on for about seven hours and besides being tight the inner sole is rough on my feet, not a very comfortable sandal. As mentioned in other reviews they are hard to get on and off.They look very nice so I'm hoping they will stretch out so I can keep them and I may have to wear socks.Amazon is a great place to shop and I buy most everything here,great customer service and no problems returning stuff."
9438,1,These shoes are light weight and very comfortable. Great for running and aerobic classes! Love the pink color too...get lots of compliments!
54280,1,"I wear a 10 and it is hard to find shoes and sneakers that fit. I ordered a 10W (wide) and they fit perfectly. They fit so well that I feel they were made especially for me.The canvas is great and seems very durable. They are very comfortable and easy to walk in, especially compared to my old clunky sneakers. I will buy KEDS from now on.I also bought the same shoe in white leather (10W) and that sneaker runs a little larger. I can slip into the white leather sneakers if I'm not wearing socks, but I cannot do that with the black canvas one.NOTE: The picture shown is WRONG. The eyelets that the laces go through are not a brass color, They are black. I was very happy with the black and I think I like them more than the brass."
75191,1,"Been using my pair for 2 years now. They are durable and quite comfortable. What I love about New Balance is that they are available in many widths, mine is 4E. It is almost impossible for me to find a pair in shopping malls. This one fits perfectly. I think the price is not too steep compared to other brands.It is my everyday shoes for work and recreation. It is described as walking shoes but I also use it for some light jogging & tennis. Nice minimalistic simple design. Leather is supple...and yes, the biggest reason I bought it is velcro."
297904,1,"I bought these awhile back and just want to say.. I don't wear heals too often, so to find a pair that I can wear for hours and hours at a time without even noticing they are on is great!!! I love the green color of mine. The footbed is very comfortable and the buckle is super cute. Get these if you can."
281956,1,"I look Fly, I feel Fly, and the ladies love me down by the pool."
245212,1,"purchased these April of 2010, am very hard on shoes, could not fault these. tips of laces haven't lasted but the laces have. they have been drenched w/water oil, sweat & are finally stretched out a bit. will buy more. wish they came with smooth soles."
275308,0,"Only one pocket inside, which I knew- so my fault that things get lost- next time I won't buy a purse with only one pocket!Main concern is that the stiching by the zipper is fraying already, and zipper itself is difficult to use.If I had it to do over, would not purchase this maker again."
283974,0,"The picture looks pretty nice but it didn't fit well on my feet. The front is too wide and the size is slightly big on me. I usually wear 6.5 but can sometimes fit a 7. I ordered size 7 and maybe that's why it's a bit loose. Heels are actually 4.5&#34;. Not happy with the style but the quality is good. If you are a true size 7 and have wide feet, then this may fit well on you."
303580,1,"These boots have been a huge hit, they made one little girl very happy. She never wants to take them off."
20563,1,"Some products are a nice surprise - like this one. The shoes are nice, standard, white, going to the mall types but there's a twist: the black converse star can be changed out for one of nearly any color! Really, they come with several different colored logo stars that slide in and out easily so that your sneaks always match your outfit. Very cool feature!"
145564,1,LOVE IT!! Packaging was perfect and product is perfect. Highly recommend product and vendor. Hope you enjoy the product and are successful with the vendor as I have was with this purchase.
111809,1,"I have been ordering and wearing these shoes as casual work shoes for 10 years. They are well made, a good price and the thing I like the most about them is how many different sizes/widths are available. Once you find the size you need you can depend on always getting a shoe that will fit."
307978,0,"First off, the shoe I received is not the shoe pictured. I need plenty of support for my poor ole dogs and this shoe doesn't have it. It is truly a light walking shoe. I have since ordered the correct Easy Spirit and love them."
367486,1,"They feel a little tight when all laced up, but I suppose most boots are and that may be considered a positive. I usually wear them a little loose and untied. I bought these for fishing (light water encounters) and snow and so far they've held up well and still look great after a little over a year. They are not 100% waterproof, though. I waded into three inches of water which soaked right through, leaving me with wet feet on my fishing trip."
50280,2,I am not satisfied bad quality unbearable when walkingwasted money
297526,1,All i can say is OMG OMG OMG....these shoes feel so good! I got them at $29.90 Shipped! Ended buying 2 pairs!
385876,1,These shoes are really comfortable and look really nice too. I'd definitely recommend them. They are the first new balance shoes I've gotten and I think my next pair will be New Balance too :)
101915,1,"Overall, these are good dance shoes. I just started ballroom dancing. I like the heel height, because to me they are not too high. They are pretty comfortable and I like the x-strap in the front because it helps the shoes stay on my feet. I got lots of complements from my dance class partners. I also got them for a good price so what's not to love."
19789,1,"Nice pair of shoes and a good price . Rockport makes a comfortable product that is easy on the feet and, in this case, was easy on the pocketbook."
204600,1,"I ordered these in a size 8. I typically wear a 7 1/2 and usually have to order size 8 in a flip flops and/or sandals. I loved the way the straps fit but wasn't happy with the length of the flip itself. My heel was at the very end of the flip. So I ordered a 9 to compare. The 9 fits much better heel to toe but the straps are a little looser. I can't stand having my foot on the very edge. It makes them look too small. So for me, I went with the 9. The comfort of both the 8 and 9 was/is great! These are easy to wear straight out of the box. No rubbing, no blisters... overall a great, comfortable flip flop. I hope they last as long as other reviewers have stated."
112353,1,"I've worn these VANELi dress flats for years and have them in several colors...and highly recommend them for both comfort and quality. They are expensive, so I always wait for sales. However, the last few times I've ordered these shoes on sale from this store on Amazon, the shoes have felt like they are at least a half a size too small. Sadly, I've had to return them."
268859,1,I've always liked Rockport shoes and was happy to find this pair which fit nicely and are quite comfortable. Shipping was fast and shoes were well packaged. I'd be happy to buy more!

39435,1,"These shoes are pretty much the most comfortable flip flops I've ever worn (I collect flip flops-my collection has over 20). They have amazing arch support, and tends to run a tad bit skinny on the straps, so if your feet are a little wider, you may want to size up."
74570,1,"I recently bought a pair of these truly amazing shoes, it is impressive looking and has a snug fit ensuring complete support. I am an athlete and this shoe is one of the best running shoes I have ever come across. I love these shoes and would really recommend them to anybody active."
153475,1,"These shoes are soooo comfortable. They are easy to slip on or off, have great comfort soles, and are easy to clean. Keep up the good work, Easy Spirit."
147479,1,"I love these sandals. They are so comfortable. This my 4th pair.Many sandals slip off of your foot; Softspot's Trinidad stays on, while remaining comfortable."
203983,0,"I bought these at the same time I bought a pair of Nike Basketball shoes.. both in size 12.5, I used the sizing guide on Eastbay to confirm the size I should buy. The Nike are a perfect fit, however these Adidas are way too small, and it is a very narrow shoe..The size is more like an 11 or 10.5, and the regular width is more like a narrow fit..Great looking shoe, very lightweight - just watch your sizing when you order this. I'd go at least a size larger, and a wide width if avaiable."
18153,1,"Thanks for the service, is very good!The product buy is of good quality, y arrived in the estimated time, I'm very happy with the service ... Thanks! and"" Happy New Year 2012""Sincerely;Angel Clark.Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela."
89510,1,"I have been wearing MBT sandals and shoes for the past 5 years and love them, especially now that I found AMAZON and don't have to wear my sandals until they drop off my feet. Thanks AMAZON for making them affordable.I have to wear orthotics in order to stay on my feet but with MBTs I do not have to wear them and can walk all day long without pain.I particularly like the Chocolate KISUMU since they don't show the dirt! Thanks MBT and AMAZON. Pat"
178108,0,"My husband has very narrow feet (between an A and a B width) and we have a terrible time finding shoes for him. I had high hopes for these (ordered an 8B), but the fit was very uncomfortable -- the shoes pinched when he tried to walk in them. We sent them back immediately for a refund (no problems there, at all). Since we didn't keep them, we can't speak to how well they might wear over time.If you're looking for good shoes for a man with extremely narrow feet, I strongly recommend the Rockport Pro-walker 7100 we later found at shoebuy.com .... so comfortable, my husband hates to take them off!!"
2799,1,"... almost as necessary for Modern Living as Duct Tape! But totally misunderstood by the low-star reviewer who took the ""Goo"" to mean ""Glue"". It isn't a glue; it's a patch product for worn spots on the soles. I've used it for years on favorite tennis shoes, and now I'm using it on my ""Vibram Five_Finger"" shoes. The latter are wonderfully comfortable, but the thin soles do develop holes ...I've also used it in a pinch on socks - I never learned to darn - and on my backpack. On a long trek, I carry a partial tube of it as well as a small roll of the invaluable duct tape ... for blisters!The low-star reviewer was incorrect about the 'keeping' quality of the stuff also. Don't close the cap too tightly, lest you need to puncture the tube to get it open, store it in a cool place, and it'll keep as long as you like.This seems to be the cheapest of the various sources in the 'zoo, once you calculate free shipping."
227183,1,"I'm a converse wearing kind of girl, And these are my favorite by far! I have roughly about 10 pairs of converse they are the only shoes I wear. They we're affordable and so comfortable! Great buy!"
312592,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
50226,0,"These shoes are perfect for getting ahead in the ongoing struggle for survival in your modern law offices. Not only do the soles provide ideal traction for rapid charges and retreats on low-pile striped-pattern earthtone carpets, but the neutral flesh color enables you to blend undetectably into the background scenery of a high-pressure strategy meeting. Buy two, they're cheap at the price."
211905,1,"Love these shoes - could not find them in ther stores in my area. They hae every color but white. Have a pair but they are really old and wanted a pair that looked nicer. The shoes are comfortable and they look a little more dressy than the normal tennis shoe. Paid a little more than the price at our stores but, they are worth the extra cost."
315354,0,"I just received my ""navy""/black shoes. They are not the navy shown in the picture. The color is almost exactly the same as the blue in the blue/orange shoe.I haven't decided if I will keep the shoes or not. Shipping was quite fast."
335315,1,were given as a gift and have proven very durable alot of running and playing was done in them and the straps stayed attached so i was impressed i never heard any complaints about comfort so overall i would consider this a great purchase
351857,1,I love ASCIS and GT2160 is a wonderful performer. I have bought two pairs of this model so far and just love every aspect of it.
106182,0,"I had been looking for an SAS outlet online without success, and found these shoes which looked VERY similar, but cost about $40 less. I decided to try a pair and they are pretty comfortable but much tighter than the SAS shoes. I use a 9W in SAS and ordered a 9 C/D in the Softspot version, although the box they came in was labeled as the same size as 9W, the same size as the SAS. The Softspot shoe is smaller and tighter than the SAS, so next time I will order a wider or bigger size."
119132,0,"My daughter has a Bloch jazz shoe in a size 5 but when I ordered her the next size 5.5 in ballet slipper, they were way too big. Will need to reorder probably a 4."
83639,1,I love these flip flops! They're soft and have great arch support. I want more in other colors!
292374,1,"Most important is that the Stephanie pump is comfortable. It's true to size and still available in narrow (AA) widths. I'd like to be able to get (AAA). The colors are Black, white, taupe, Navy, and bronze."
4452,1,"Want to add my recommendation for a great waterproof boot. Why pay more? Going on two years of use, trail hiking, backpack camping, urban hiking and an occasional run. It's that comfortable. Need the support of a full-height boot and this one gives good ankle protection. Waded through streams up to my ankles and kept my feet absolutely dry partly due to the gusseted tongue. Deep multi-directional lugs give great traction even on the muddiest trail. Cleans up pretty well also. Showing a little wear around the heel and toe, but attribute that to walking and jogging on concrete and asphalt since the lugs look in perfect shape. Otherwise bullet-proof. Could be lighter but would not trade this for a less durable boot. Will probably buy this boot again when this one wears out, but who knows when that will be?"
208411,0,"Cute boots, but they run small. Or, rather, the length is fine, but the rubber toe is very flat, so that your toenails get smooshed. Bah!"
297253,2,"the shoes looked way better on the picture. they aren't very durable and after wearing them once, they were really dirty and had creases at the toe."
102670,1,"I bought these shoes for my mom, and she is the pickiest shoe shopper ever! She absolutely loves the comfort of these shoes and hadnt been able to find them for years! Good thing there is amazon! She hasn't been able to find shoes as comfortable! She says size are true to size, and she wants me to buy another two pairs! Good to know I've made my mom happy!"
365135,2,"These look really cute on and I thought they would be comfortable, but the soles do not bend at all. I've had them a few months so they are broken in. After a few hours my arches ache. Cute but killer!"
260638,1,"Right out of the box I knew these were going to look awesome with casual clothes for work or fun -- Love the Navy color, the white laces are a stark contrast and complete the outfit.Enjoy wearing them!"
70392,1,"I love these shoes. They look great, you can wear them with almost anything, and they're incredibly comfortable. The only downside is - they fall apart quickly (after a few weeks wear). I'm on my 3rd pair. Nonetheless, I highly recommend them!"
20355,1,"Nice shoe that gives proper support and fits true to size. If they hold up well, I'll be buying more in the future. Very comfortable, however, you may want to get rid of the cheap inner sole that comes with the shoe and replace it with something more sturdy and cushioned like a Spenco Polysorb Walker."
358657,1,"I ordered this style for the second time, only in a half size larger...they fit and I can dance in them. The last pair was too small and although I could dance in them, they were very uncomfortable...I still have them, but, can't use them. when they say to order larger than you regular size, pay attention, it will be worth your while,..."
329388,1,The most comfortable flip flop I have ever put on my feet. It's like memory foam for feet!
282534,0,"Although I like these Malibu sandals, they are bigger than the Life Stride ""Milani"" sandals I bought a few years ago at Macy's. I thought I was purchasing the same shoe (they look similar)- my mistake. It appears that life Stride no longer makes the Milani style. I can wear the new ones with an orthopedic insert - but am disappointed that they are such a large size seven."
269790,1,Product received promptly and was exactly as expected. Was a repeat purchase of product I liked and the price was right.
261393,1,"it's a little bit smaller than the usual size, but it's warm and soft and very comfortble ."
127034,1,These shoes fit great and look cool. They were shipped on time and looked exactly as described. My son's friends complimented him on his new shoes!
73272,0,Already own a pair purchased about 2 years ago. Sizing is much smaller now even though I ordered the exact same shoe. The bottom of the shoe reads the same as before but it's about 1/2 inch shorter. Caution to order a larger size now!
189834,0,"I love the look of these boots because they look warm and tough enough to get me through the winter when my sneakers or rain boots won't cut it. Plus the way they remind me of pirate boots goes a long way. However, after eagerly taking them out of the box to try on when they got here, I can't get my foot down in them because the opening to the boot is too small. I'll admit that my calves are a little bigger than some, but I've never had a boot do this. It's a stylish and well-made boot, but it's designed for girls with stick-figure legs. I like them too much to return them, so the only real solution is for me to modify the boots to fit me. It just seems like such a waste to have to cut up my new boots."
53401,1,"I've been eyeing the graphite colored Keds for awhile now and I am not disappointed that I finally bought them!I am normally a size 9 to 9.5 in shoes, and because of the loose fit from a previous pair of size 9.5 Keds, I went with a size 9. So they fit perfectly. I've worn them walking around the city a few times and have had no pressure points/no blisters/no sore spots. That's the ultimate test for me--comfort in walking. Well, they definitely passed the test."

142872,2,I normally wear an extra wide shoe. I ordered these in size 4E and it was too narrow to even start getting my foot into it.
318812,0,"bought these for work because I stand all night( I bartend) on concrete. I have Plantar Fasciitis and these are barely ok. There are much better shoes out there. I wish I could return them. oh well - there are better shoes at being ""The Body Shoe"" I'm surte. all)"
50049,1,the shoe says it all. they are incredible.
246940,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes.

334010,1,"I have been wearing Wallabee's for about two years now. When I was younger I always wanted a pair of brown leather Wallee's, but I couldn't afford the $120 price tag. Now that I am making my own cash, I have three pairs, and another on the way. They have to be the most comfortable footwear known to man. They are extremely durable, as I have had one pair for more than a year, and as long as I keep applying mink oil to em, the still look and feel like the day I bought em. If you are having second thoughts about buying a pair, stop thinkin and just hit that ""order"" button. You will not be disappointed. A little tub of mink oil is highly recommended if you are getting the leather ones, especially the beeswax, as they have a tendency to scuff quite easily. Enjoy."
161449,1,Just came back from shootin' hoops with my new Chuck Taylor Hi Tops. Been wearing them since '64 -as good now as they were then!

118170,0,This is not an all terrain shoe and should be used only for manicured grass and soft tracks.... but for those surfaces it is an excellent shoe
368513,0,They were okay and the size was fine. Just a little stiff and needed to be broken in.
241496,1,An all year kind of sneaker shoe that can be worn from all. Really comfort for every day use. There is a wide variety of colours which can cover all needs
146860,1,The only thing I can say is that she waited four years for a pair of Uggs and she loves them and it was worth the wait.
32738,1,Very cute! My 6 year old gets so many positive comments every time she wears them. Good quality. We both love them.
348526,1,My daughter picked out these shoes for part of her Christmas gifts. She loves them. This is her second pair. She finally wore out the first pair. She's a college student so the shoes get a real workout walking back and forth to classes.
120704,1,"First of all I suggest 1/2 number less... if you compare it with adidas sneakers. The shoes are great, made with good materials, good design and very comfortable. I ordered these sneakers on black, but came gray on logo and the rear part, but there's no regret about it, looks so good. Definitely I recommend this item."
304632,0,"These shoes are good value for money. However they run very small. The first pair I bought were a half a size larger (6.5) than my normal shoe size (6) but they were still too small. I tried stretching them to no avail. I then bought a second pair and bought a size 7.5 which fit, with a sock on or an insole in, ""comfortable"". I would have given them a better rating if they had fitted true to size."
129583,1,"i was very excited to receive my first pumps. yes im 21 years old and these are my first pumps. i heard good things about Jessica Simpson's shoes. when i wear them i feel like the heel is going to break, because the heel is very thin. however these shoes are quite comfortable when you wear them alone without tights. Because the times ive worn them with tights they are very loose and uncomfortable. other than the heel being very thin i would def. buy more Jessica Simpson shoes, but with a ticker heel. i would recommend these shoes for those who are comfortable wearing pumps."
205486,1,I bought these for my husband and he absolutely loves them. He likes the style and says they are also comfortable (bonus !!!). Great purchase.
8574,1,very nice looking boot but they run narrow. the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me.
269860,1,These are wonderful slippers. My daughter is enjoying them immensly in this frigid weather!
211640,1,My 94 year old Mom loves these shoes and they are almost impossible to find in the store. She as several colors of this style. Her feet are now smaller so we needed to adjust the size. Could not find them in regular stores. Mom loves the comforrable fit and they are safe for her to wear.
44786,1,"These shoes were too big for a woman size 10 feet. So I sold it on Ebay, but they were a nice bright color."

223726,1,"International delivery was rather quickly.As a result, great value for twice less money comparing to offlines stores.The only dissapointment was little cut on 1 boot, but it's hard to see it in everydaywear."
66798,1,That's a product with a long tradition in market and I just was replacing my old sneakers. Coverse really rules.
177169,1,"An old school shoe, with style. How did our feet survive these things? Oh, that's right, they didn't."

112588,0,"LOved the sandal, the look, the construction BUT- it was too wide for my ordinary size 9 foot! Sad!"
278743,1,"This is my fourth pair in the last four years. I wear them for work, so approx 60 hours a week and I walk NON-stop. I truly wear holes in the soles. There are well made and SO light weight. They are comfortable and I NEVER have any foot pain. I tried buying a different brand a few weeks ago because they looked almost identical (they were $15 cheaper) and I regretted every minute of them for two weeks straight. I threw the other ones away and bought the tried and true! They are completely waterproof and wick away the moisture from my feet. I will never buy a different boot."
16641,1,Amazon Soccer Shoe PurchaseThe product was delivered as promised.It was appropriately delivered as described including the color and size.

WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
261120,1,I love them in every color!! :) The shoes are simple and perfect! I have worn them for many years and I will continue to do so! I highly recommend these!
252266,0,"Cute shoe but absolutely no support. I can only wear them for short periods, and NO WALKING distances."
241732,1,"I love the new reebok shoes but they should make them for women also. Because they are wonderful they feel good when you were them. The reason I gave the shoes 4 stars is because they don't make them for women becuse most women play sports like: basketball, and other sports. I think that they are wonderful as a matter of fact you should buy some and I mean right now! Go, run and get these before there is none let. Serious cause knowing me and all of my friends and family are going to be wearing them. I love reebok shoes!!!! Buy them NOW I mean it!!!"
387053,1,"Boots are very comfortable,however I cannot seem to get more than a year or so out of a new pair. They wear very easily in patrol conditions. A 9 in comfort. A 5 in lasting quality."
282426,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
66394,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
266597,1,"CAUTION - likely over 75% of the positive reviews that apply to these boots, do not actually apply anymore to these boots. After wearing out a set of these boots over the years and proclaiming them my favorite ever - I asked 'Santa' to bring me a new pair for Christmas. I was very bummed to find out the boots are not made the same as they were before. There are some minor exterior differences which indicate a lower quality manufacturing process, such as the poor quality detail of the Hitec logo on the metal quick lace points as compared to my first pair, or the rubbery look of the leather. But the biggest change is that a low quality insole has been substituted for what was a very comfortable insole.In my first pair of these boots was a very comfy insole with a much thicker arch cushion. In these new boots the insole is stamped out of one uniformly thin piece of rubber foam from heel to toe, with not nearly enough cushion to protect your arch from the rigid boot frame. The old insoles were contoured with varying thickness along the insole, and with at least 5x thicker cushion in the arch. So these new boots are digging into my arch and they are basically unwearable.*** UPDATE JANUARY 15 2013*** I called Hi-Tec customer service and discussed the difference in the insoles. They offered to send me a pair of MAGNUM 3D2 Contoured Comfort Insoles - they are much better in every respect. I am revising my review up to four stars based on the excellent customer service I received."
228327,0,"I love these shoes. However, I ordered the wrong size and exchanging them has been a hassle. It has been over a month and I do not have the shoes or the money and no one can seem to help me."
255459,1,The only thing I do not do is sleep in them (well not usually). It is very hard to find shows as light as not wearing anything. I cannot stand shoes that form fit and are all fluffy and hot. I have run the gambit in color as they became available and not in my size. I used to let them ware out completely but now I use the new ones for work and the old for play and the garden. There is a pair that does not seem to want to wear out I keep hanging from the treadmill.The only thing I regret is they did not even ask what I would pay for them to be made in the U.S.I am giving serious though in having a backup pair.
188262,1,"I have big, wide feet and needed shoes that were good for work (I am a medical student and work in a health clinic. I have tried flats, Aerosoles etc. These shoes were very comfortable and wide enough. They look a bit goofy, perhaps because I have big feet. But overall I am veryyy happy with them. I finally have semi-dressy comfortable work shoes."
103439,1,"I am providing an update to a negative experience I expressed in a previous review about this vendor. The vendor called me today to discuss my concerns. After our discussions, I felt extremely satisfied, that he is truly focused on his customers and provides a quality service. My situation was rectified and I am extremely satisfied and would not hesitate to order again from this vendor. It is wonderful to still have people who care about their product, reputation and their customer base"
22224,1,"My husband has worn this shoe for years because they keep the shine and wear like iron. He has hadonly one pair that was not a perfect fit, and a shoe stretcher fixed that."
234614,2,"I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women. I ordered them, waited anxiously, tore open the box when they arrives and...The 4E (which was labeled on the shoes themselves, so it wasn't a mistake in size) was NOT wide AT ALL. They were narrower, in fact, than my mother's medium width shoes. This is NOT an industry standard 4E... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed."
150472,1,"I'm actually a non-dancer and have been looking everywhere for retro t-strap heels for a reasonable price. I found these shoes on another site and hunted around for the best price. Not only were they cheap on Amazon, but when I got them and tried them on, they were cute, sexy, light, and totally comfortable. I could see myself presenting at a day long meeting or out on the town walking all night in these. The only reason these didn't get 5 stars is that they seemed a little cheaply made for the price they go on most sites. I wouldn't expect these shoes to last forever, especially if you give them heavy wear and tear, i.e. dancing."
273023,1,"wow. these shoes are awesome. they are extremely comfortable. not to mention the attention i have gotten from these (i currently own the blue ones) for instance people laugh and point out the good year insignia on the sides and back, and the distinct colors that these shoes are made in. these definitly attract attenion. and plus they just overall, look real neat. and they are unique. i am in high school, and i am the only person i know that has these shoes in a school of 2100 kids in omaha nebraska. trust me, these shoes are definatly ""hip"". haha."
358041,0,"I bought these for tap shoes for my daughter. Shoes are good quality did not realize in the fine print, TAPS NOT INCLUDED. Could have bought shoes for less else where with taps."
170681,1,"Awesome shoes. Not necessarily worth the outlandish cost but 4 stars nonetheless. I'd recommend them to anyone who takes running seriously, and who likes to look even cooler when doing it."
29350,1,I've been looking for these for a while. These exceed my expectations. I have them now in the 10 inch & 17 inch.
372233,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
152944,1,"I bought this as a gift, and the recipient couldn't be happier with the product:Positives:- Quality- Appearance- WarmNegatives:- Price- Not water resistant.Great product, according to recipient of this gift."
13732,1,Super comfortable - love the style and goes with everything. I had a pair in the 80's and I missed them - I am glad there are still around.You should be prepared to order down - I wear a size 7M and ordered a whole size smaller and they are perfect. I did need to do a return for the size and it was easy and fast to do the exchange.
82520,1,"I buy it for a gift and the person who reseved it is very happy, they was in time and very good packing."
90975,0,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
126094,1,I was very pleased with my purchase. The only thing that I was a little disappointed in was it took a little long for the shipping.
73552,1,"Most comfortable shoe I've ever worn... I have 2 pairs, black and brown, that I wear with just about everything year round. I should probably buy a back-up pair in case they quit making them..."
360104,1,After I got the right size these where the most comfortable dress shoes. I don't dance I just wanted a pair of dress shoe that I could actually walk in. I had to get a whole size larger then my normal tennis shoes. I normally where a 9 But I had to get a 10. I first got a 9.5 but they were just a bit to small. Unfortunately the company has a restocking fee which make sending them back cost almost as much as the shoes. So do yourself a favor and get a whole size larger.
337716,1,"These are good shoes. They have a classic look and the monochrome look adds a nice little something something. A good, safe buy."
252996,1,"Any man that cares about his appearance should own some desert boots. These shoes are the best I have ever owned. They are very comfortable and the leather molds to your feet in no time at all. They don't restrict your movement at all even though they are boots. They scuff easily which makes them age very nicely. The beeswax finish makes them weatherproof and perfect for rainy days and the wintertime. They do run big so order a half or full size smaller. I would suggest trying to find a store to try them on before you buy online. They are a lot cheaper online so thats why you would want to order them that way. I always wear too pairs of socks with mine, extra padding and insulation since there is no padding in these."
230491,1,"I purchased these boots to replace a pair of burlys that were quite old; they had cracked along the top of the foot near the ankle. My husband uses them to slosh through the hilly woods on particularly soggy days as well as for wading in streams. I am told they are completely waterproof, quite comfy, have awesome traction and the fit is mostly true to size. They maybe run a fraction big, so to be a perfect fit when wearing thick socks. He's very happy with these boots. My father has been wearing LaCrosse boots for as long as I can remember and these latest boots continue in the tradition. I didn't give them a 5 for a purely girlie minor detail. I think some people might roll their eyes now, but here goes, they smell bad. Despite the advertising that they are scent free, it took a couple weeks of airing out to get rid of the rubber boot smell. It doesn't matter so much for us, but if you are planning to use them for hunting I would recommend buying them early so that they have time to lose that smell. Otherwise they are perfect!"
18987,1,"These boots are great, I bought them to go with my halloween costume a while back and now I wear them every time I go out. Its been 7 months now and there still in great condition."
343576,1,"awesome shoes. what can i say. look great with pants, jeans, khakis. whatever. versatile, durable, sylish. you won't regret this purchase. maybe run a half size bigger than my size. but it's iffy."
131698,1,"I originally bought these shoes just for indoor soccer and found them to be so comfortable that they became my main pair of casual shoes. I agree with another review that says they take a short bit of time to fully break in, but once you have broken them in, they are extremely comfortable and stylish for regular usage and perfect for indoor soccer."
240515,0,I had these same sneakers in the past and same size etc and they fit well. These hurt my feet after a little while so I haven't worn them in a while. I know I cant return them as I wore them for an hour out in the yard so they are a little dirty. I just think they aren't made the same as they were about 10 years ago.
119444,1,No surprises here - great company product line and great boots right out of the box (and a big size 14 box it was). This is a good boot fit - snug pull-on not a slip-on like a loafer - but not difficult to get on. The closures work well and I've already tested the waterproof seals - no leaks. As this is not a race boot the look is relaxed and it is all-day comfortable for walking around when you get to your destination or secret spot. I'm expecting many miles and years of comfortable riding with these boots.
54983,1,"I had forgotten how much I loved my ""sneakers"" back in the day when I routinely wore Keds. Now I am in love with them all over again. Great shoes!"
358997,1,"These are the greatest sandals I have ever bought. They are comfortable, lightweight, and durable. Everything you might ever need."
256187,1,"This looked like a terrific shoe, but was the wrong size. I think I would rather try on in a store from now on instead of waiting for delivery, paying for a return, and waiting for the next size. I would order from the net no problem if I was sure of the size."
164710,1,"OK. I have been wearing this style of shoes for decades. Decades! You don't go back time and again to buy a shoe that isn't comfortable, long wearing, and a good value.One reason I keep coming back to this style of shoe is it looks very nice and neat. It doesn't look weird. So many shoes look just awful and I can't imagine how anyone could wear them. I call them chunky-clunks as they don't look feminine in the least.These shoes come in many colors (I usually buy a neutral color) and everyone should be able to find a color they like. I've worn them in the rain and have had no trouble with them (not talking about floods here.) All in all, I recommend this style of shoes."
106978,1,"I wasn't sure if I should order these shoes online. I usually like to try them on before buying. However I am so glad I did. They are very comfortable, have great traction and look awesome. The wide width is perfect. These shoes definitely feel true to size. I just wish they would come with longer laces."
160211,1,"muy buen producto y muy buen vendedor, todo me salio como yo esperava y hasta ahora todo esta muy bien."
186653,1,"We have purchased this same shoe for our handicapped adult daughter for years. They have served her well. However, today while travelling to Florida in the rain she complained of a wet sock. We checked her shoe and the bottom had broken into a 3 inch crack. Very disappointing since they were fairly new."
325087,1,I wanted something that was nice quality and not flourescent or ghetto. This really was one of the only choices. Nice shoe. Great quality. Laces are really long.
87806,0,"5 Stars for comfort and looks ""new.""2 Stars for cleaning and maintenance. Plastic on the sides keep you from cleaning the material. Dirt and stains show through. Bummer on such a cool looking shoe!"
379927,1,"I bought this shoes for my school show choir and it was really comfortable to wear it while dancing!! Besides, the leather of the shoes are beautiful. Notice that shoes size should be larger than usual. My feet size is 6.5 and I&#12288;buy 7 wide. It fits perfectly but while I wear socks, it becomes tight to me.But still I can wear when dancing. So maybe a half or one size larger is better."
183975,1,"What other shoe makes you taller, provides a smooth ride, is good for your feet? When my favorite pair of black dansko oiled clogs began to show signs of wear after about 5 years of wearing them to teach almost daily, I ordered another. Even though the leather top has softened and scuffed, the soles begun to wear down a bit, I'm leaving them at school/work and wear them everyday in my art room. I'll wear the new ones out and about and keep them nice. Shoes in the art room tend to get a bit splattered! I have flat feet, bunions and developing hammer toes and these shoes keep my feet happy!"
144515,1,"I am very pleased with my new Classic Tall UGG boots. I followed the recommendations of others and ordered an 8 (I usually need an 8 1/2 or 9). The fit is amazing. They are so warm I forget I am not wearing socks. I live in Maine and usually wear wool socks all winter, this is incredible! I did read the reviews and used almost an entire can of waterproofing spray to protect the suede. I gave them two coats a day for three days before I wore them. I will avoid wearing them in really sloppy weather (I have boggs to wear in the slush and med) but for the regular cold and snow - I don't know how I managed without them."
18066,1,I got as a casual peice and also to wear to work they are half a size to big but I will live. Great Buy
94971,1,"Have been purchasing Propet products for 2 years now- Love them. Sturdy, comfortable and long lasting. Only grief I have had is the stitches coming loose in the toe area. Very stable when walking. This particular style gets only 4 stars because the tongue seems to ride too high up on the top of the foot, rubbing a bit; annoying but not to the point of discomfort.Will continue to use Propet as my official work shoe."
131766,0,"The sizing really wasn't true. I usually wear the size I ordered, but they stretched out dramatically, even after re-lacing. I wish they fit better because I really do like how they look and they were comfortable when they fit well. I would recommend ordering one or one-half size smaller that what you usually wear. Wish I did..."
69576,0,"I bought the same size as the ones I already had, but they were too tight. I went into the Crocs web site and questioned it. I received no reply or explanation. I discovered that as I wore these clogs, they stretched a little and became more true to size. I am disappointed that the company didn't have the courtesy to reply, so I will not give them the courtesy of another purchase.I had no problem with Amazon."
194167,1,"Best sandal I have ever purchased! I have every color, but still keep on buying them, mostly in black. Always want to have a pair or 2 that looks brand new. Thay are SO comfortable, especially if you have foot or leg problems. I am 63 and have been buying these for at least the last 8 years. I do have foot problems and sometimes they are the only shoe that I can wear. I am in love with these sandals. The metallic ones are good if you want something a little dressy. Again, so comfortable, well made and they last a long time!"
203961,1,He has to get a new pair every year! These r GREAT Winter- Fall Boots ANDDD depending on how u rock them- they look cute with Fatigue Shorts. I MUST SAY- I LUV THIS CHOCOLATE COLOR!!
110759,1,"Ordered this shoe for my Mother for Christmas. It seems to be a comfortable style for her. The hook and loop on the strap is secure, I whis it were a little longer as her feet swell sometimes."
309958,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
242832,1,I followed recommendations from others who reviewed this product before me and ordered one size bigger. I didn't regret my decision. Those shoes fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. Definitely well worth the money and a great purchase for someone who just started.
159134,1,"Great boot for the price, fits and feels good. HIGHLY recommend the replacement of the cheesy footbed that came in the boot."
298422,1,"I have put about 15-20 miles on the boots already, but they seemed to work well the first time out. The sole is structurally sound, and the uppers supportive. I am confident to hike over rough, rocky terrain with these boots. They looked especially good after applying Danner's Boot Dressing suitable for gortex lined boots. The uppers are a little stiff if laced tight; which is good for steep downhill to keep your toes out of the end. However, on flat ground I have installed 2 sets of shorter laces. The first set for the first five holes (like a low hiking boot), and the second lace for the upper four holes ...tied looser so I don;t spend so much energy flexing the uppers all day long."

108380,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
128752,1,A few years ago I had knee surgery and I can't wear heels any more and I am not allowed to wear gym shoes to work. These shoes give me the comfort and stability of a gym shoe and the style to be professioal. Love love love them! Fabulous!

350886,1,"This is my 4th pair of Merrell Moab Ventilators. I walk 4 miles a day in a mix of gravel, pavement and grass. The Moab offers better support and durability than athletic shoes I've owned costing nearly twice as much. I wear them every day for both casual dress and workouts. You can't find a better shoe for the money."
86571,0,"These shoes were very comfortable, but made too much noise while walking. An air pocket formed and caused a sound with each step. I have poorly formed feet so it is probably more a problem with my feet than the shoes. I wish they didn't do that because they were so comfortable."
288764,1,"I was pleased with the price and the quick delivery of my shoes. Timberland stores are becoming harder to find, but I love the quality of these shoes. They are totally water proof, so I can walk the dogs in the morning in the wet grass and still have dry socks for the rest fo the day."
192318,1,"I have another pair of these shoes and loved them; therefore, I purchased the pair through Amazon at a good price."
207353,1,"I have been looking for bronze boots for several years now and I have to say that I am very happy with these boots. They are very, very comfortable and of course, very stylish. The most important feature (for me) is that they are not too high of a heel and that they provide some support, as far a boot is concerned. These boots meet my requirements. I may just have to purchase them in black. If you are looking for style, fit, and an excellent price, I would grab these boots right away!"
298306,1,"See, I am usually a fan of the Clark's Wallabee, but I wanted to try something new. I ordered these bad boys (*knowing they run a little large!!!*) and I was impressed! I wish they were not so dumbo-toed (aka: flare out larger around the tip of the shoe), but whatever... I love em'"
196931,1,"I had heard a lot of really great things about these boots from a friend of mine who is an ironworker. I asked him to recommend a quality work boot under the $200 range (Red Wings are just too pricey for me), and he suggested I try these because he has owned a pair for a while and wears them to work every day. Also, many of his coworkers were really fond of them because they are union made / American made. The styles and quality of construction are very much on par with RW boots, but these are half the price or less that what you would pay for RW's. I knew as soon as I took them out of the box that these were very well made, and the leather is soft and supple. The quality shows in every little detail. I had done a bit of research and read that they run large in their sizing. Some even suggested trying a whole size down. I've always worn a size 10, so I purchased two pairs; a 10 and a 9.5. Sure enough, the 10's were way too big for me, and the 9.5's were right on. So, please be advised when ordering these - it may be safer to buy a half-size down to start with.My only minor complaint is that there seems to be a lot of room in the heel of the boot. At first it bothered me, but as they have worn in, the boots have seemed to conform to my feet a little better and the roominess in the heel is less noticable."
238490,1,"I have used this wallet for 4 years now. For $20, it is a great wallet to get. The best thing about this wallet is the small form factor: if you dont hold alot of cards and cash, this is a great wallet to have. It also limits the amount of cards you can hold. I would say that you could hold 8 cards in the back and maybe 3 in the clear sleeve if you wanted to. Occasionally, I end up with that many cards, but this is achieved after considerable stretching of the leather.The only negative thing about this wallet is the clear leather front: it started chipping away/breaking over time. This was because I kept removing and returning my ID into that pouch area. If you simply keep the ID in that pouch, I do not believe that it will break.Anyway, I'm buying another one of these wallets to replace my breaking one. I highly recommend this product if you want a slim fitting wallet and dont have too many cards."
215236,0,"I'm a commercial HVAC contractor in the mid-atlantic. I am on a roof 6a-2p 5 days a week. We get snow a few times a year, and the temps sometimes fall into the teens. I got these boots as a christmas gift; my steel toe belleville's were freezing my toes off at work. my standard boot size 11R fit just fine.However, after 1 good year of solid wear everyday for 3.5 months; and the occasional use after that: they have worn out. The tread is more than 60% gone. The 400 gr insulation was never enough, my feet were warmer than in steel toes- but they were frozen. Water soaked through in numerous places, and trudging across a roof during snow-maggedon was cold. I will not buy another pair of these; and for my line of work it's not recommended. The insulation has also worn out, and as it gets cold again- it's almost as bad as wearing steel toes.Tradesman's verdict: tradesman, don't buy em. harry homeowner/ hiker/ guy who needs a good winter boot; Highly recommended. If you don't wear these day in day out and aren't rough on boots- these would be great. But for what I do everyday- wolverine- y'all gotta try Harder"
224214,1,"These are my 4th pair of chucks and I love them. I know exactly what I'm getting and I don't have to try them on. I normally wear a 8.5 in womens, but I order a 6 in mens when I buy chucks. It took almost a week from when I placed my order to receive the shipping notice, but the shoes arrived 2 days after I got the email. Just wish they got here sooner!"
335211,0,"This is the 5th pair of these shoes I've purchased. I buy at least 2 pairs a year. They're comfortable and I like the way they look. However the last 2 pairs have had problems with the stitching coming undone very soon after purchase. I still like them, but I'm definitely looking for a new boat shoe."
248080,1,Very comfortable & stylish. I use these for my work where dress code is dress shirt/slack. They blend in just fine.

218709,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
311600,0,"I LOVE Dansko. They are my favorite shoe. I don't wear anything else to work (since I am on my feet ALL day). I wanted to wear some heels since my new job and thought who better than Dansko? Well, I loved the look of the Remy the best and bought a pair at my friends shop. When I got them, I wore them around a little on my day off. The only problem with this shoe is that my toes literally get cramped. And I don't have wide feet. In fact, some shoes are too wide for me. Especially if they have been tried on too many times and have been stretched out or broken in. Other than that the arch is fine. But I couldn't get past the cramped toes. I didn't even know your toes could get cramped. Unfortuneatly, I do not wear them for more than an a couple of hours at a time. If it weren't for that, they would be the perfect heel!"
53730,1,The shoes came earlier than expected and were in good shape. They were brand new and in the box and the size was correct.
205269,1,"$300.00 seems like a lot of money for a pair of shoes, but I have been very happy with these. They are very comfortable for everyday use and walking."

115601,1,"A very nice looking, comfortable shoe. My husband's favorite was the Venetian shoe. He liked the comfort sole as he walks on concrete floors all day."
51297,1,i've owned a pair of these for 6 years now. they are still going strong and i wear them everyday. i have taken these boots from jungle terrain to salt water and they are still going strong. the only thing i have ever had to do to them is have them re-soled. everything else on them is perfect.
89261,1,True Minnetonka Moccasins are extremely comfortable. I live in mine and they still last at least several years. I find the smooth leather much more durable and stay in good condition longer. Enjoy!

106844,1,Comfortable shoe. Nice deep white. Good leather uppers. Shoes really last. True to size. Wear at work at least 10 hours per day. Good support.
122621,1,Sketchers have been the only shoes I have bought for years. They fit as though you have broken them in as soon as you get them and they last a long time. I really like these all white shoes. They look classy (as long as you keep them clean) and really pull outfits together. My only complaint would be that I can't figure out a way to get the tongue of the shoe to not scunch down. I have to keep pulling it up. I even ran the laces through the loop but that didn't help either. Maybe once I get them fully broken in.
162790,0,my husband said they where good for his job but they only last him 8 months in his job because he works outside in all type of weather.
77658,1,Not what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised once they arrived. Delivery took forever because of the processing of the order...
160554,1,"the shoes were awesome quality, shipped very quickly, but i guess that style runs big, i usually wear an 11, ordered that. they were huge, had to send them back."
220435,1,"I bought a pair of these boots some months ago. I was initially nervous about the price, as they are neither cheap nor are they Redwings. After wearing them to work for months, I'm sold. These are probably the most comfortable boots I've ever worn. First off, they make these boots in my size, which is not something I find often -- I wear an 11-1/2 EEE. Second, they require no breaking in or additional insoles. They were more comfortable right out of the box than my favorite, most worn-in old boots. I work as an inside wireman, or construction electrician, mostly in heavy industry. They are standing up well, so far, to the daily beating I put them through, which includes walking through, scuffing on and kicking rocks, rusty metal, concrete, sand, muck, water and about anything you can think of.Pros:- Amazingly Comfortable- Manufactured in a wide range of sizes- Tough, easy to clean off- Steal toed with EH rating- Water-resistant (My feet haven't gotten wet yet)- Union made in the USA by UFCW workersCons:- Soles wear a bit faster than Redwings- Insoles will start to wear after about 4-6 months, may need to be replaced in a year or so"
262348,1,"Saucony Jazz shoes are well-made and comfortable. They're great for casual wear, for athletic outings, and for traveling. I wear a half-size, which makes it difficult to find comfortable shoes, but these fit me perfectly. I've had them for several months, and they have continued to be comfortable and supportive. People tell me that they make my feet look small, which is an added bonus. Another nice aspect of these shoes is that Saucony rarely changes their style, so if you'd like to own the same pair of shoes ten years from now, they'll probably have them. I have one frivolous complaint about these shoes : the shoe laces that came with them are a little bit too long. I have a tendency to step on them and untie my shoe laces. I didn't think that such a trivial complaint was worth changing my rating for. These shoes are also very easy to wash. Overall, these shoes are reliable, and completely worth their price."
360442,0,"It's a very good product (Capezio), high quality but the heel is too high for students that are doing character dancing for the first time; beginners should start with a 3/4"" heel... ...unfortunatelly, I just learned that!"
73295,1,"i've always hated seeing people wear these shoes out in town as a regular shoe... but i got a pair after a training deployment to Thailand and blew out 2 pairs of flipflops (shower shoes) walking over gravel and dirt going to and from the showers. I got the Realtree cammo special just to be different from everyone else and i love them for what they are. great on the beach, at the river, around the yard and house. i just wish they made the XXXXL in white. id really like to get a white pair in my size for my dads wedding comming up later this year. hes getting married on a boat on the river and were all doing a casual dress up.all in all, great shoe. but i still wont wear them out in town."
383154,1,Very comfortable and cute shoe. I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size. I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look.
237627,1,Versatile shoe appropriate for both jeans and skirts-- comfortable enough to wear all day long without blisters or foot pain. Highly recommend.
366200,1,I like the way they look-nice and neat.They are soft and comfortable. One thing though-when I wore them on a rainy day it felt kinda slippery on the road.

190873,1,"Comfortable, functional, and the price was right. They might not be highest quality, but they also don't cost $100+. I used them for a tango class I took. They aren't too tall of heels, and they have just the right amount of slide vs. traction. I love the T strap style too."
137557,1,el articulo me encanta.. me parecen demasiado lindos... y me llegaron en perfecto estado! muchas gracias por sus servicios !!
315538,0,I would have like the shoes to be just a little softer....but I can be quite satified with what I got for my value. People look at the shoes and say how nice they look.
105209,2,I thought I finally found a perfect pair of shoes. I'm on my feet all day so it's important for me to get a good cushioned shoe. According to the reviews I ordered a wide yet I always wear medium width. When I received them I immediately triedthem on. I had to double check if I ordered the right size. They fit tighter than any shoe I ever bought. I was very disappointed to say the least. And the next day they were back in the mail on their way to you.
194900,1,"This is the third time I have purchased this shoe, it isso comfortable, my other shoes are jealous as they sit silently in the closet collecting dust. If you want a comfortable shoe, a good looking shoe, I recomment this one. And the price was right!"

335746,1,"I was reluctant to try out these ugly clogs, but finally decided to see what the fuss was all about and took them on a trek in the Panama rain forest and wore them as a camp shoe for a week. Even though the Caymen is supposed to be a closer fit than the Beach, they still feel very loose, as if they're going to fall off, at first. But after getting used to them and forgetting I had them on, I realize that this contributes to the comfort. Unlike my usual sandals, these dry by simply wiping them off which is a huge benefit in wet environments. I still think they're fugly but they're extremely comfortable for wear around the house or camp, and light enough to always take with you on your travels."
308773,2,"I don't know if it is the shoe or my foot, but I am finding them too large at the heels so they slip there causing irritation when I am walking/jogging on the treadmill. I would not buy this style again."
130373,1,"I broke an outer bone in my foot 4 years ago. Never had therapy. Bought these shoes and discovered that since the break, I had changed my gait to put pressure on the inner foot in order to take pressure off the healing outer bones. In doing so, I'd changed the line-up of my whole leg. The pain in my hip made me think my running and walking days were over. The Kayanos keep my foot in it's natural position and since that first day wearing them I've never had hip pain. The shoes feel like clouds on my feet. I cried. Freedom to run and walk never felt better!"
219151,1,"These are pretty nice casual sandals, but my feet tend towards the narrow side and the straps don't fit snugly around my feet...perhaps it would have worked out better in a narrow width, but all they had was medium width."
321881,0,"I received my 9.5 N ballet shoes today. Before ordering, I measured my foot from tip of big toe to end of heel.Using that number, I decided to go a half size larger ""just in case"" some of the people who warned ""too small"" were talking about my kind of foot. Well, the shoes are even too small at half a size larger!! I always buy athletic shoes one whole size longer. If I buy these again, I will do that---so if you wear a 9, get a 10! The ballet shoes have the curved toe, and that design makes the big toe land on one of the short curved sides...well, mine anyway. Also, I have a very narrow heel, and they are too big in the heel...so too short and too wide a heel if you need a narrow size. However, I will keep them and maybe order a size 10N. Do measure your foot standing on a tape measurer, and to whatever size it says to get in the measurement instructions add one full size. I want to kick myself! : kkp"
338009,1,"Shoes arrived in wonderful shape; packaged well; exactly what I ordered.However, we ordered the wrong size. Return went well; advised my account would be credited for purchase price only; but there was no stock available nor could they tell me when they would receive more in the size we needed. If you need a specific size, order it ASAP."
90947,1,"I bought these sandals for my mom because they looked nice and were from Softspots a company I love. She hasn't worn them out yet but reportrd them to be very comfortable. Just what we were looking for. Excellent product as usual. I highly recommend,"
198679,1,"The last time I wore a pair of chucks was back in the early 80's. They are just as I remembered them. They are comfortable and easy to break in, plus my feet don't hurt after wearing them all day. Awesome shoes!! I'll be buying another pair."
191472,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
267951,0,I ordered thise for my son for Christmas. He usually wears a 13 but would have needed a 12 in these. He didn't really like them for hiking; they are more of a work boot. You can't just ship these back to amazon; you have to pay to do it.
372753,1,excellent converse all star. the product was well described and satisfied my needs. the shipment has been quick
93945,1,"I got these shoes for less than $25, and have a hard to fit (narrow) foot. The shoes fit great, and are very comfortable. I would buy these again."
38226,1,"I had a pair of Skechers (of another model) that I really liked but they got covered in mud. So I had to buy a new shoe that looked more professional than sneakers but was still comfortable to wear. After looking in many stores and not finding anything I liked, I came here and looked for a new Skechers. This shoe is great. It is comfortable and looks good. I really enjoy it and recommend it."
114172,1,"Thios show is great! Comfortable for my daughter to wear, and excellent capezio manufacturing. However, my daughter wears a 6.5, size 7 she has some room. I ordered a 7.5 wide, I danced for years and know ballet slippers are narrow. The 7.5 barely fits! I would return them but even the 10 minutes she wore them around the room showed too much wear to return. She will be able to wear them a few wooks before having to order new ones."
137179,0,"I bought these around New Years, and by June, the sole was already breaking apart and the back of the heel was deteriorating. I stopped wearing them regularly and they eventually wore down further and got few holes in the canvas right above the sole. I was expecting a little higher quality unfortunately. :\"
220484,1,I love these boots they are perfect for my six year old. They are durable and I love the darker color so the dirt does not show as much. The price was great and shipping was fast
200798,1,"I bought these Sperry's in the same size that I bought my last pair because they don't change from pair to pair and they just work. Do not hesitate to get these, they're some of the best casual dress shoes money can buy and they work for almost any occasion."
295765,1,"A friend asked me to recommend a pair of hiking/camping boots. These are the one and only pair boots I owned in the USMC Infantry, GI boots will ruin your feet, I threw them away right after boot camp! Re-soled them many times, never gave me blisters. The tongue will sink if you don't ""break"" them in, completely soaking them and wearing them until they dry changing socks regularly for 1-2 days to 'shrink' to fit. Don't take them off until they are ""completely dry"", then kiwi them regularly, soft/supple. If you are really serious, upgrade them by re-sole-ing them with the most flexible soles you can find, your feet will thank you after 30 miles everyday weeks on end ;-)"
115795,1,Have been pleased with these boots 2nd pair I have bought. Great water proof and very comfortable soles. I like that the laces don't break easy because of they have eyelets all the way to the top.
201698,1,These shoes fit like a glove. They are very comfortable and true to size. The inside is soft suede-type leather with padding in just the right places. I thought there was going to be a break-in period but these shoes were comfortable to walk in from day one. A very sturdy and comfy shoe at a great price.
332617,1,"I love Crocs. They're a great substitute for slippers around the house and you can wear them outside. Your feet stay cool and breathe. They won't get sweaty like they do in sneakers/tennis shoes. One warning: don't wear them on the treadmill. I didn't find they gave me enough support there, but they are great for casual wear around the house or running errands. They wear very well. I wear mine almost every day and have had them for 4 years. Might try some other styles in the Crocs brand."
195222,1,6 N is a hard to find shoe size. This white sandal was perfect in every way. It's exactly what I was looking for !!
374848,1,"I bought these for my husband they look great, and he loves them! They have a suede look to them that makes them a little more dressier than your typical boat shoe. Very breathable material! Highly recommend!"
346130,1,"the shoes were perfect and came right on time. however, the very first time i wore them, they got scuffed by a tricky curb. i wish you could have installed some kind of invisable force field around them so that they would stay so white. you really need to work on that."
243478,0,... you know the aggravation when you get a pair of shoes that make your socks slip down at the heel ...
232543,1,I have the one in tan as well. Very classy looking and comfortable...typically that's a hard combo to come by in a shoe. I highly recommend this show!
313879,0,"I was excited to read in the description that the flip flops were black and yellow. I'm happily thinking Washington Redskins yellow. They were actually black and light blue which is the Reebok color for this type of sandal. Fortunately, they were a gift and the recipient was pleased, even though I was not."
280398,1,"Great shoe for the price. Compared to other sites, best value offered for a shoe that fits true to size and of good quality. Seller A++ with fast delivery."
272220,1,"My daughter very much liked her slippers, however they were not like the one pictured. I think she likes hers better than she would have liked those pictured."
337835,1,It is exactly as described on the post. I'm very pleased and I highly recommend the product if you like converse products of course
359208,1,"Excellent value, comfortable fit. Especially just above the heel the leather has a concave shape that is very comfortable when I prop up my feet so that the tendon gets no pressure. I also like the saltwater proof eyelets."
89654,1,"I love these shoes. They are very comfortable, and people compliment me about these shoes all the time."
210921,1,"Looking all over for a 'cute' shoe/boot to wear while riding my motorcycle. This shoe FITS!Sizing: is great-right on the mark. I was not used to a high top and was a bit difficult to get on and off for the first few wearings.Comfort: wore these on a weekend ride to upstate NY and was very comfortable. Another day wore them shopping all day...still kicking!Price: alot to me...but I really liked them, HAD to have them. Best buy here... $75 and up at other sites!"
315339,1,These shoes are the best. They are so comfortable and really cute. I got the lilac patchwork ones and I wish I had gotten a couple of more colors before they sold out.
140484,0,Two friends with narrow feet had purchased these sandals so I ventured forward ordering two pair on sale. Had to send them back. The straps were not nearly snug enough to keep them on my feet. Each step was an effort.
142573,1,"They fully met my expectations. Very light weight and comfortable. I bought them to wear only on the beach, but ended up wearing them home from Hawaii on the airplane!"
212485,1,I now own five pairs!!! All in different colors! Hope they never stop selling them!
63523,1,"I live in northern Minnesota and these are great for winter. Warm, waterproof and good grip on the icy sidewalks. Very comfortable too. I have a very nice pair of Sorel winter boots but they are HEAVY for day to day activities. During the winter I wear the Sorels to work and then keep a pair of tennis shoes in my office to change into once I get there. No need for that any more. Driving is nicer too. Have you ever tried to drive a vehicle with giant winter boots on? Not fun."
326436,1,"Love these but my only issue is with the fit- they are a bit smaller and more narrow than other Reef's of the same size- I should have ordered up a size with this style. Other than that, they are great."
293861,0,"I bought the size I would typically in the glass, and they are seriously tight. I would have probably gone up a half size if I had been able to try them on. I think it is fixable with a shoe stretcher, and this is just a warning."
69796,1,These are good shoes. I have only had them for a little while but I have already put a lot of miles on them. They are holding up quite well but the tread on the ball of the foot on both sides is showing significant wear. I'm not sure how long these will last but so far a very comfortable and servicable shoe.
100729,1,MuCh more comfortable than they look. Everything old becomes new again. Platforms are in once more.
178635,1,"These shoes,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top are the ones that I've looked for all my life.They are extremely comfortable, well made, fit just right, keep you warm in cold weather and cool in the summer. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Please, follow the advice stated in the link regarding women's and men's zises.This is very important.Don't get confused with other brands or models. I wish they'd come in different colors, I'd get one of each."
51499,1,These do promote a more stable stride especially on slick surfaces. I only buy Propet for walking shoes. They are quality made. My only disappointment was the sizing. They run wider in the heel and toe than other shoes I've purchased from them in the same size.
11149,1,"These shoes are very comfortable and good looking for casual dress. Furthermore, on a really rainy day I found out how waterproof they are. I stood in 2 inch deep puddles and my feet stayed perfectly dry. 5 stars from me."
127717,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
198207,1,"I have been wearing all stars for way to long now, and these are just as good as I remember. These shoes are iconic, we all know how good these are, the oxfords are a great change of pace from my high tops. These shoes will never go out style!"
109829,1,"Received the promptly ,they are made very well .This is my second pair and just love the way they fit ."
332613,1,Well made and very versatile. I wear them casually and to work in the yard. They hold up well and are easy to clean. HIghly recommend.
339823,1,They are the shoe of shoes. I own multiple pair in different colors. They are great shoes and will last you... Be carful they can rub your skin raw if you don't properly tighten them.i could wear these shoes for days.
118419,1,"After reading many of the reviews I ordered a half size bigger. My daughter is a 11.5 in street shoes and the 12M I ordered are too big and too wide. I am glad I did not order a full size larger, as many reviews suggested."
330501,1,These are a nice pair of casual work shoes. Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks. They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer.
37289,1,"Buenos tiempos de entrega y el producto lleg&oacute; en buenas condiciones, Pueden comprar en esta tienda cuando quieran, 100% recomendable"
34658,1,I LIKE THESE SHOES THE STYLE AND WEAR IS VERY COMFORTING. THEY CAN BE DRESS DOWN AND UP IN WHAT EVER YOU WEAR.
77866,1,"I just received my large Harvey tote except it is not large at all I wanted a medium but I am glad I ordered the large, it is a lot smaller than I expected, but it is well made and sturdy! I really like!"
96231,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
367817,2,"I think the shoe is fairly comfortable, but a little too clunky and heavy around the sole area! Eccos are better!"
340133,1,"These shoes are as soft and black as my heart is. Much more comfortable and sexy than hi tops IMHO. They'll make your feet smell, though."
198596,0,"I purchased from the photo. was in a hurry that day. Glad they where the low ones he wanted. novelty item. My son wanted them , he is 30 yrs old. A fun item he used to have many years ago. the size recomendations was correct. 1/2 size smaller was just right.... Not the Hi Tops they state in the add."
236981,1,My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them. He says they are comfortable and also look good. I would recommend them to anyone.
66273,1,"This is a comfortable slide in a neutral color, but the leather is a bit stiff, not as pliable as some of the other Clarks sandals I have. Maybe it will soften in time. But they are still good everyday sandals and they were a good buy, hence the 4 stars."
377080,1,"I am on my feet 12 or more hours a day. Cement floors and high activity have destroyed multiple sets of shoes. I have bough some brands and totaled them in 3-4 months. The only thing showing wear is the finish. The toes are scuffed up from crawling and moving around working on equipment. If there is work to be done I am all over it. My shoes better be prepared to take it all. These Wolverines are comfortable and solidly built.When I do finally give them more then they can handle, I will be buying another set to replace them. I would love a more durable toe area for lasting beauty but I don't want to give up the comfort that these shoes offer to my hard working feet."
165504,1,I brought this for my Mother. She loves the shoes. This is the only place I could get them. Her Christmas was made by receiving this product.
153196,1,"My feet have hurt most of my life. When I slipped these on, I was in heaven. I wore them to work and after 8 hours, my feet still feel wonderful. I'm going to order several more in different colors. What a relief!!"
219250,1,"This is the only shoe that I could find with a sole that doesn't cake up with mud (to be released bit-by-bit around the house). They are not as comfortable as some that I've had, but they are very well made."
260216,1,"Came exactly as expected. Perfectly white and fit fine. It does get dirty easily but when wearing white shoes in NYC, that's expected. I'll probably buy again but in a different color. The only thing to note is that the racing stripe on the bottom is not blue, it was black."
207546,1,"These shoes are well worth the money (which were on sale when I purchased them). They fit well and are very comfortable for walking and standing. I have knee problems and if I wear a shoe that does not fit properly or if I have to limp or compensate for foot discomfort, I suffer with increased pain in my knees. I highly recommend this shoe both for looks and for comfort."
324693,2,"These shoes feel great, fit great too. The worst part about them is they squeak, and squeak loud. I cannot sneak out of the office or around employees because they are so loud and everyone knows I am coming."
306146,0,"These shoes were not as comfortable or durable as comparably priced Rockports. Like a few other reviewers, I also had a problem with heel wear as the edge of the heel quickly wore down exposing a particle-board type interior. There is about 1/16"" of rubber on the bottom of the heel, but the sides of the heel are basically particle board that has been painted black.The other down side of the wooden heel is that the shoes are indeed loud, especially if you wear through the thin rubber sole on the edge where your heel first makes contact with the ground. My wife was always worried that I would wake up the kids in the morning with my foot steps in these shoes (and only these shoes), even when I made a point of walking lightly.On the positive side, they look decent (until the heel wears) and they're cheap. However I'm going back to Rockport for my next work shoe."
191091,1,"The sandals are super comfy - and I have badly battered feet - so comfort is of top most importance. Have only one complaint - that Naturalizers don't carry the SCOUT sandal in Canada, so had to go via daughter in the USA, and she had to ship on to me. Don't understand that sort of merchandising. This is shoe - not some Cuban Cigar nonsense."
69449,1,It's great to have summer footwear for the Big Man. I wear a size 15 shoe and I have trouble finding a variety of shoes. Crocs are available in XXX-Large (14-15). My daughter bought me my first pair of Crocs from my college alma mater and I loved them so much I bought my next pair for myself from Amazon.
334374,1,Worn these for almost a year and the shoes has yet to show signs of deterioration. They are extremely comfortable and reliable with great traction. I have the black pair and they look great. This pair may last for years to come even with the heavy usage I putted on them. I would no doubt buy these again.The only drawbacks are minor and arose from it's great traction. The bottom has small grooves and therefore get small pieces of sand stuck to it sometimes. The traction also create havoc for dancing because it's most difficult to twist and slide and spin in them.
268361,0,"I loved the unique look of these shoes. However, it's best not to consider them as everyday or daycare shoes. The pink paint at the toe began flaking off within a week of everyday wear. I love that they were easy to get on and off, and were a good fit for my daughter's slim foot. Had I paid the full original price I would have given the shoes an even lower review than I have, but since the price was pretty low, I gave them a break."
316508,1,I received the men's clark wallabee shoes very quickly and was very happy since this was a Christmas gift.
122910,1,"I bought my first pair of these exact type of shoes back in 2006. I absolutely love my Premium Skechers, and I will continue to buy this pair until Skechers no longer makes them. They are sporty, fun, and cute, and I love to simply run around in them. I really liked purchasing them from Amazon because Amazon offered these shoes in the specific size and color scheme that I like...and at a better price! Way to go, big A!:)"
178903,2,"i love the converse, but not the store, i have a big problem i made a mistake and they didn't help, now i have two pair of the same color, i and nobody size like me."
223269,1,I bought these shoes to go with the tan pants in my nursing uniform. They are wonderful and many people like them. They are shiny shoes and tend to make a person look like they just stepped out of a band box. I have received many compliments on them. The shoes are easy to wear and comfortable.
195012,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
194905,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
111968,1,Very happy with the product and also the price and service. Product was an international purchase and arrived in tact.
240855,1,My wife asked for some slippers for Christmas with the specifications that were for Isotoners. I checked the Isotoner website for styles and colors with those specifications and decided on these. I bought them through Amazon.com as I knew they would arrive on time and be exactly what I ordered.
233599,1,"Bought for my husband, nice colors and shipped quickly. And durable was hit by a car and came out with minor washable scratches"
236304,0,"I have worn the K-Swiss Ultrascender for many years. With it's high arch, heel support and numerous design features, it is without a doubt the best court shoe I've found. Unfortunately, the current shoe has been dumbed down from its original version. The high arch support is still there, but many other features have been removed probably in an effort to reduce production costs without raising prices. I am disappointed in K-Swiss, and feel the company is misrepresenting this product to those of us that have purchased it in the past. Next time I'll know to look for a different shoe."
88230,1,"When the Crocs first came out and I saw people wearing them I thought they were just silly. After a few years I started to think maybe they were comfortable because so many people were wearing them and saying how comfortable they were. I ordered some from Amazon, who had some for my large feet, and I love them. They are so light and comfortable. The only time I have put on a different pair of shoes was when I went hiking on a camping trip."
348629,1,"If I wear jeans, then I'm wearing boots, and these are it. I love these boots. Comfortable from day one, they're long lasting, they look good, what more can you ask for? Highly recommended."
305549,1,Bought this shoe for my son. He was amazed at the comfort. Good shoe
245995,1,Angel II is a slightly improved (more graceful-looking) version of a versatile old favorite. It is almost a flat but looks enough like a classic heel to endear itself to those of us who can't endure anything higher. And it comes in a welcome range of widths and colors.
116983,1,I found this shoe an excellent fit (true to size) and very comfortable. Would recommend them to all.
291369,1,"I've had a pair of isotoners for maybe 20 years now, they were coming apart and I needed a new pair. I like to wear them on trips, as they can fit in any crack in my suitcase. These were a perfect replacement, and even a bit more comfortable than my original pair."
15070,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
148942,1,Fits right and allows me to dance better. The shoes are the same size as my street shoes. The price is half what is charged at the local dance store.
87262,1,These are one of the most comfortable dress shoes I have ever worn. I normally wear tennis shoes being a nurse and so I know what is comfortable. I bought these softspots after buying two pairs of shoes that were just so uncomfortable and produced blisters. Now I am not going to dread wearing dress shoes and now make them my go to shoes.SoftSpots Women's Stephanie Pumps
254925,0,I got exactly what I expected. A casual dress shoe of good quality. Goes good with jeans or khakies. If you have arch problems you will need an insert for the shoe has no arch support. The shoe is flat inside. Yes I recommend this shoe and with normal use I expect it to last 18 - 24 months.
384642,0,"My husband wears 10.5 and those shoes do not have 1/2 sizes. I got 11 and 10 to see which pair would fit, but neither one did. Otherwise, nice color selection and as much as I can tell nice quality. Rating of 3 due to sizing."
123158,1,"I have had these kind of shoes before and I had to have another pair. They are comfortable if you will be walking around for hours like at the fair or an amusement park. I am an RN and I am on my feet for the entire day, and I have worn them to work and have not felt strain on my knees or back or feet at the end of the day like with some shoes."
214629,1,"These boots are awesome! super comfortable and sturdy. I've had other snow boots and these are the best yet. The boots do look kind of chunky and they look one size bigger than other boots, but they fit perfectly, very true to size. I just can't wait to wear them in a snow day!"
356959,1,"I loved absolutely everything about my pair of Keds - excellent throwback to my elementary school years - however, they were a tish too narrow for my big flippers so they had to be returned unfortunately.The yellow laces definitely gave the graphite color a pop that made the Keds cute and fun. I might hafta order this in a wider size... :D"
255468,1,"I recently bought the 4th pr of classics for walking. the fit is great. colors b/w or gry look good w/all.my 3rd pr (way ovr 400 mi) & the 5th pr will be classics. used also for fishing, yard work, shopping,driv-ing; everyday. Soon as we get our price #5 will be ours. Confidence."
58206,1,"I love my new keds, Ive never owned a pair, only heard about them/seen them. I have worn them off and on for the last 4 months and have to say them feel awesome and look great with just about everything!"
69653,1,"I decided to try the Green Silence because I wanted to see what impact, if any, a lightweight shoe would have on my times. I picked the Green Silence for the ""eco friendly"" concept, and because of the crazy color scheme. Not really an informed purchase.I'm a 6'- 3"", 190 lb. guy, so I'm not small. I've been running on Nike Zoom Vomeros for the past two years and didn't think that I'd find a shoe that would offer me as much comfort as the cushioning found in the Vomeros. I was very happy to find that despite their light weight and minimalist design, that the Green Silence offered the necessary amount of cushioning. I was also pleased with the large toe box. I've used them for 3 runs so far. My thoughts:Run #1, speed work, 6 x 400's:My feet felt more... nimble? Without the weight of my typical shoe weighing me down, I felt like the speed work was much easier. This was my first effort with these shoes. I ordered size 13 (I usually wear size 12 in Nike), and it was perfect. NO blisters after my first run. Total of 5 miles, including the 6 x 400.Run #2, tempo run, 5 miles:This is where I expected to start to complain about the more minimalistic design. Nope. My feet felt great, still no blisters. I also noticed that I'm not landing on my heel the way I was before.Run #3, long slow run, 10 miles:I still can't believe that these are a lightweight shoe. The cushioning provided a great ride for the entire run. At the end of 10 miles I felt like I could have kept going for another 10. Finally, a blister on the front of my big toe, never had that one before... I still think ordering the size bigger was the right decision though.I would definitely recommend these shoes."
133902,1,"Super stylish and comfortable. Great choice for traveling and going through TSA security checkpoints at the airport. Easy slip on and off. I own these in both black and brown. Love them, but unfortunately, I can only rate these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because I stand on my feet all day at work. I started a new job about a year ago which requires standing all day. These shoes were well broken in long before then. At the end of the first day in which I wore these to work, my feet were killing me. I will still wear them, but only for travel and during off time."
229396,1,shoes fit very well and came very quicklythey look good toogood job on these shoes im very happy with these shoes
232489,0,"These shoes look great, fit great, are comfy, but the stitching at the tongue started coming apart after wearing 3 times!"
197769,2,The service from American Athletics is poor. The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size. Won't be shopping there again.
56838,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
249652,0,"Since I wear a size 13 wide, my choices are limited. These are very confortable. The leather ties keep coming undone, even when double tied. Not quite as nice as real lambs wool, but good for the price."
171216,0,"Took on a trip, but needed some break-in time. Caused some discomfort on my bunion. But I am sure they will be fine because I have two other pairs that I love."
151155,2,These shoes do not have the moving air pocket that the old classic DMX has. I would not reccomend them
49769,1,"This is my fifth pair of ballistic so far. I bought my first ones about 14 years ago and was immediately satisfied with their confort. This is a product of excellent quality that, on average, tends to last more than 3 years without breaking apart. Please, keep in mind that I do use them often and I am not a sedentary person. They are a bit tall compared to other sneakers, but that has never been a problem. Really confortable and highly recommended."
197676,1,"my son bought these with his own money and we were disappionted to find out the sizes run very large. Wasn't made very well, sides began falling apart. Wouldn't buy this one again. Did arrive quickly."
63099,2,"Well in one of the descriptive pictures the bottom of the shoe is all black! The shoes I received were a brown rubber color on the bottom of the shoe. Also in another picture, the shoe inside is white and the shoes I received were blue inside. They are not as comfortable as a pair of keds that I owned years before."
184110,1,"Bought these boots for extreme cold weather use. I am familiar with Danner boots from my military service and can't say enough good things about Danner products. Once again Danner delivered on Quality. These boots are expensive but worth every cent I paid. They keep my feet warm, they required no break in period, and they are extremely comfortable. You can buy cheaper but you won't buy a better product."
290685,0,Not as comfortable as the world walking classic shoe . i would recommend the latter although the pro walker is less money
193987,1,"I had been looking for navy sandals in my hard to find size for about a year. Finally found them, but decided canvas close toe shoes looked better with skirts. Service was good."
217807,1,I wanted red converse sneakers and could only find them at this merchant online--they were priced below $30 and arrived in less than three days looking just as described.
149800,0,Made in China as I thought...when are we going to start making things in the USA than we wouldn't have to buy things over and over cause they would last!!
23423,1,Very comfortable sandals that have lasted through the season and provide a welcome bottle opener. Will buy another pair when they wear out.
376727,1,"As a nursing student I'm required to wear white shoes for clinicals. Trying to find plain white shoes in a 4E width was nearly impossible. I looked for weeks locally in stores, only to be confronted with certain brands that cost over $125! The Propet shoes not only fit my foot, but fit my budget at half the cost of the shoe store. Very comfortable and they look good, too."
110751,0,"I liked these shoes a lot. I ordered them a little big, and they are holding up quite well."
17176,1,"I ordered these for a little boy as part of a Christmas package for a non-profit that helps parents get gifts for their chidlren due to crisis each holiday season. I was so pleased when I opened the box before sending them to the parents through the annoymous match program. I just know that child was thrilled with his little shoes on Christmas Morning. I am so glad the shoes were sturdy, cute, and will bring joy to a child until he outgrows them more than likely. HE will be stylin."
94002,1,"Have been purchasing Propet products for 2 years now- Love them. Sturdy, comfortable and long lasting. Only grief I have had is the stitches coming loose in the toe area. Very stable when walking. This particular style gets only 4 stars because the tongue seems to ride too high up on the top of the foot, rubbing a bit; annoying but not to the point of discomfort.Will continue to use Propet as my official work shoe."
122200,1,These little pumps are exactly what I expected to receive. They look simple and neat. I had to stretch the right one a bit as my right foot is wider than my left. I would definitely recommend them.
52045,1,"This is the second time ordering, and I order two pairs at a time. My husband is a flats/backcountry fishing guide, on his feet, poling a skiff 8 hours a day and LOVES them."
203287,1,"I bought this boot for my son who is 8yrs old. it is made of the usual high quality material, looks like it will last a lifetime. I will recommend this product to anyone who has a kid that is very active. Also it arrived quickly!"
127708,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
200674,1,"I have long, very narrow feet = size 12.5 + (but less than size 13). Sperry size 13 Medium is not a good fit for me because it is too lose.Sperry ""12.5 B"" size is a true 12.5 ""Narrow"" last. It is the equivalent of the last for US Govt size ""12.5 Extra Narrow Jungle Boots, which are the only shoes/boots that have ever fit my feet.I bought 4 pair of 12.5 B Sperry Top-Sider shoes in Dec 09. I would buy 4 more, if other colors, e.g., black, were available.Please continue to produce size 12.5 B.Regards,OldPJ"
377754,1,"ispent 270 bucks on a pair of boots that are too big for me! i ordered a size 12 which is what i wear in all foot wear..i got these and my toe is a little past thelaces on the toe of the boot. however, Danner is such a superior product that even having too big of size, they are still super comfortable and dont kill my feet. the waterproofing is water proof and they are pretty warm too. MAKE SURE YOU ARE GETTING THE SIZE YOU NEED BEFORE PURCHASE!"
379979,0,"I ordered a size larger as recommended and it turned out to be too large for me. Half a size larger would have been better. The shoes feel comfortable, except that the sole of the shoes feels slippery. I was afraid I would slip and fall, so I returned the shoes."
38284,1,Heavy duty and VERY comfortable. I'm really rough on shoes. I've had these only a short time but can tell already they are well made and will last. Great value!
205597,1,I was soooo tickled pink with my pink Nellie Chukka boots. I saw them on the web page and I had to have them. Pink is my favorite color. They are extremely well made. They didn't need breaking in either. That is a major plus. They fit perfectly. Also they arrived in record time except it was like waiting for Christmas. I love them so much it is all I can do not to wear them to bed. :-) I want several more pairs. I am waiting for them to be available in red leather.
97133,1,"I got my first pair of Sambas when I was 13, and they lasted 9 years. And I'm a soccer player, so they certainly saw their use. Durable, comfortable, and classy, this is a terrific purchase for the casual kick-around at the park or a serious afternoon on the pitch. The leather upper is really comfortable. The only downside is the massive tongue, which has a tendency to either a.) look goofy or b.) rub against your ankle when you walk. But this Samba won't squeak when you walk, so it's worth it.If you're on the fence, just do it. You won't regret it. And you'll always have a shoe that feels good to wear to class, to the gym, or out to eat."
36147,1,"VERY COMFORTABLE, GOOD LOOK, AND WARM SHOES, RECOMMEND, MOSTLY FOR THE PRICE. FIT TO SIZE. IT IS VERY GOOD!THANKS."
251179,1,"Sandals are wonderful, but I did get the wrong type. The order was for the Nubuck (suede like leather) but I received the regulare leather type, but rather than send them back for a swap I just kept them. Not perfectly what I wanted but Still Awesome Sandals!"
367508,1,i loved the mocs...totally..but one was 1/2 size bigger than the other one...but it was marked the same..maybe should check on quality control
330893,1,If you know Justin quality you know these are excellent boots. These boots are very comfortable and are highly recommended.
288852,1,"I have not found a shoe better than this pair and I have tried a lot. I even tried orthotics especially made for me, without success. Nothing feels as good on my feet as Justin Boots and they didn't take long to break in. Thanks for providing a fantastic product! I will surely buy more Justin Boots. :)"
324374,1,I love Crocs-this purchase makes the third pair I own. I purchased the All Terrain because I wanted the comfort of Crocs but didn't want the dirt that gets into the vents while gardening. I also used them while hiking around while on vacation. The sizing chart made it easy to translate the men's sizes into women's.
242641,1,I purchased these for my grandson for Christmas - They arrived in plenty of time and were exactly what I ordered. It was all he asked for and he was totally excited when he opened them. He put them on immediately and just kept telling me how much he loved his shoes.
180064,1,Converse's are classic. they are the shoes people are always going to wear. i like the high tops better though
370454,1,Love the way it fits( like a glove). The design is perfect for &#34;working&#34; your feet while dancing. This is my 3rd pair and I always reorder this style.
292531,1,This was perfect.. It was true to size brand New as suspected and I would recommend this product to anyone
290275,0,These boots are cute but too long and pointy. I got a size eight because with pointy boot normally they run tight at the tip. The size eights are huge. I have other size eight boots that look like these and they fit great. So just a heads up pick your true size or a smaller size.
289235,1,"I owned a pair of these years ago, loved them and decided to get another pair. These are good fit but a little stiff. I'm hoping that will go away once I break them in and scuff them up a bit so they don't look so neon white.Overall, a great pair of shoes for walking."
338453,1,It is exactly as described on the post. I'm very pleased and I highly recommend the product if you like converse products of course
128909,1,"These are nice slippers and were received in a timely manner. However, even though I ordered these a size larger based on other reviews, they were still way too small. I returned them and reordered them two sizes larger. Return and reorder process was very easy. Other purchasers may want to consider ordering 2 sizes larger."
217848,1,"Why doesn't anybody state that they run full size large? Maybe it's not even worth mentioning as everybody knows that, but I've never had experience with Converse before. I bought those in size 10 (men's) for my brother (he always wears 10) and they are big even for my husband (who wears 11). Other than that they are OK, good quality."
48815,1,Shoe fits to size. They are the most comfortable shoes to wear especially in the hot weather climate. Cool on the feet. Can wear socks or not with the shoes. I would buy another pair.
375761,1,These are the best shoes I have purchased without paying hundreds of dollars for them. Excellent for someone who has to be on their feel all day!
380521,1,I needed these shoes quick so I paid the $3.99 for 1 day shipping and they came the next morning. I did order one size larger and they fit perfectly! The are very comfortable. Less than $30 for a pair of Capezio shoes is a great price too.
348023,1,"These shoes are really comfortable........right out of the box.They provide good traction, even when wet. Classic styling!"
52826,2,This shoe has made my big toes cry out in pain. I wore them for two days at work several weeks ago and my toes are still hurting. It is all in the cut of the front of the shoe - it seems to become more narrow too soon. This is funny to me because I wear AAA width shoes and these were too narrow for my toes (wore their regular width shoe)!!!! They are the worst.
89874,1,"I've been wearing these shoes for years and love them. I ordered them because I have not seen them in black in the stores. Unfortunately, they were too small and had to be returned. I am probably going to reorder. My advice is to order a half size larger than you normally wear. Otherwise, they are a well constructed, long lasting shoe perfect for every day wear."
134171,1,"Shoes are excellently made, they're extremely comfortable and the leather is one very shiney; not a cheap imitation. If you have wide feet and want durable, great quality and price boots, these are the one!!! I bought them for my small brother who has Down Syndrome and he simply loves them. I even bought him an extra pair of the same model. Previously I had bought other SAO boots in stores here in Puerto Rico and they've all turned out a great purchase. But, that was years ago and now SAO shoes are sort of hard to find here, so I searched these hard to find shoes through the internet and thank God I found them here!!! I'm very thankful. Keep up the excellent job!!!"
303845,1,"If you want comfortable sandals, these are it. I bought some from a famous footwear 5 years ago when i moved to arizona, and when they fell apart 3 1/2 years later, famous didnt have them anymore. So i turn to amazon - and voila! they have them. minnatonka thongs....they dont get any better than that"
219434,1,"I love to wear my keds. The price, the quality and having them available was why I chose them,Its had to find keds this time of year. I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size, just leather not canvas material. Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found."
51622,1,"These shoes are great. Stability when walking. Size/fit are true. I would recommend these shoes for all walkers, but especially for those like me, a senior citizen whose daily exercise is mainly walking. I had purchased a white pair last year and was very pleased with them so I bought these black ones to wear in the winter."
251496,1,"I love these shoes! I have bought several pairs in different colors. They are as comfortable as atheltic shoes but much more stylish. But beware--they run small! I normally wear a size 6.5, but I have to order a size 7 with these."
3486,1,"I've had a few different pairs of hiking boots over the years. These are great boots. I've had them for almost 2 years and everything is holding up. In fact, if I clean the outsides, they look brand new. I wear them almost every day.I've had them in 4&#34; of water and my foot has never got wet. I've walked through the muddy clay that we have here in East TN with no problem (the same mud that tore my Vasque's to pieces).As far as comfort goes, they are as comfortable as house shoes. They required maybe a week of everyday wear for break-in time, but even that wasn't too bad. They were just a little stiff, but not like other boots you have probably owned in the past.I'd say for the money I paid for these, they were a great value."
41446,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
90425,1,These shoes look good for work and are very comfortable. I have purchased Bacoo Bucci a lot and will continue doing it. Highly recommended!
13117,0,"Shoe is a bit narrow. The heel is higher than I wanted-2"". Could use more padding in the ball of shoe, which is where you put your weight when your dancing. I'm a beginner dancer and the leather sole is slippery even after using sand paper to rough it up. (I found a suede sole to be less slippery for a beginner.)"
364787,1,Good and quick. Love the shoes although it was a bit confusing whether it was hi top or not as it showed up differently on my order form. But it was hi-tops and I'm happy :-)
241158,1,"Ok, I'm 47- and a professional female - probably heading back to my 2nd childhood - um - if I ever left childhood completely in the first place?Anyway, I hadn't had a pair of Converse Hi-Tops since I was around 12 years old. I had seen some of the more ""artsy"" ones, but could never find my size (average foot)when I was looking...and I knew I wouldn't be able to wear them to work if they were ""artsy"" Converse - because they are, after all, athletic shoes.I decided to buy the completely black Hi-tops...and they are great. They are comfortable, even on my 47 year old feet. I really like them a lot. Glad I bought them, and maybe I'll even see about getting a pair of the Artsy ones...or maybe a pair in pink???Hope you'll enjoy yours, when you get them."
216454,2,"I Love the look of these shoes, however they heel is extremely hard and the left shoe of my black pair has an annoying squeak in it."
147475,2,Softspots Women's Trinidad Slip-OnLast year I ordered a size 9 in this shoe. It was a too big but I used a sole insert and a heel pad which solved the problem. The shoes wear well and are comfortable. This year I ordered the same shoe style in size 8 1/2 thinking it would fit perfectly. It was so tight I could not get it on. I returned the shoes and reordered a size 9 which fit but are very snug. These shoes have a strong chemical odor. I have aired them for a week with no improvement. The entire closet literally fills with this odor and I now air them in the garage. I may have to return these shoes too.
272929,1,"These were a great buy, I had tried several different shoes and these were the best fit. I have slightly wider feet and the curved top of shoe is better for my toes than any other. They may be expensive but are more likely to fit the best!"
14625,0,I like this shoe its comfortable and looks nice. The only thing that I've been disappointed about so far is that after I washed shoes on gentle cycle some of the pieces started to separate from the shoe.
288520,1,"I live in the tropics and have tried many flip/flops. This is the one I'd want if I could only have one. I'm a hundred kilos (220 lbs), mid 50's and this flip/flop is good to your feet. Good arch support, rare in flip/flops. The sandal is quiet. The strap connects further to the rear than most flip/flops which makes the sandal hug the foot better thus making it more quiet.I'll buy another pair soon."
181815,1,"I work in a coal plant, so I needed some real heavy duty boots. These boots do the job and more. Was mad the other night and threw one at my wood front door...straight through. Caterpillar makes some heavy boots...thats a fact."
263881,1,"My fiance wanted some new converse shoes for his birthday, so I searched the internet for awhile trying to find the best deal, this was definitely it! It was the best price paired with free shipping, and they came within a week, so that was great! They've also held up very well, and he loves them, so they get quite a bit of use!"
192202,1,Not only is this sandal comfortable it also protects your entire foot. I've owned many brand name name sandals and this particular Columbia stacks up with them all. It is not a waterproof sandal but it stays firmly on your foot when wet and it dries quick and cleans off fairly easy.
298085,1,"This is the 2nd pair we have purchased. My husband is on his feet all day and keeps commenting how comfortable these shoes are. He also usually has problems breaking new shoes in, but not with these. They fit perfectly from the moment he put them on!"
277909,1,"I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT"
261734,1,"These shoes look good, they feel good, and they don't cost much. If you're feet are strong enough, you can even run in these (I do)."
1934,0,"I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain, much of it off-trail and over rocks. I've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years. The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially, but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use. When the foam becomes compressed, the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt. This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds, or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec, as I've seen it with other boots and running shoes also. Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use. I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes don't just use suitable footbeds in the first place, but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles, the boots themselves are comfortable, keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated, and the soles provide good traction."
365354,1,"I got a pair of converse shoes for Christmas almost 3 years ago, and I have been wearing these shoes almost ever since. They feel comfortable, they look good, and they have hardly any wear on them after 3 years. As a matter of fact, I have them on right now as i am writing this review..I'm thinking about buying another pair in a different color just because i love them so much."
153749,0,"I love UGG boots...this pair is my second. However, I am not happy with EastBay, the shipper. They shipped me the wrong product and then took three and a half weeks to send me the right product. I had to continuously email them about the status of the shipment...very annoying. I love the boots though...so soft and comfortable."
91437,0,"This might sound weird, but these shoes are too sguishy. When I am taking my daily run, my shoes always hurt because it is too squishy!!"
352491,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
326405,1,I love the pink cleats shown... there look is so bright and when your on the field the cleats just glow as you run and its so cool !! That is why i love these cleats.
139892,0,"This shoe is very attractive, and I am please with it. I was looking for something to wear with jeans and slacks that I could walk alot in. I have never had a pair of uncomfortable aerosoles!"
61261,1,"Not a bad boot, but needs a substantial break in period. Bought it in the wide width, but it would be nic if wide were a bit wider."
169671,1,The boots came within a week they are legit and came in brand new condition as stated. I am very pleased with the boots and they are a good buy. they are durable and will last you at least two years if you take good care of them.
219076,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
32148,1,"couldn't use metal cleats in my league, bought these and am 100% satisfied. my buddy has a pair too, he also likes them. good traction all around."
90908,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
219992,1,"The Puma Men's Roma Shoe is simple but classy, yet good for everyday use. A great selection of colors assures that you'll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe. Not only do these shoes look good, but they feel good also. I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile!"
367220,1,"I gave this to my husband but it's for both of us. We have sports that entail wet clothes, mountain biking and skiing. We dry everything like gloves, shoes, boots on this heater and it works great. It's so helpful when you needs things for your next day's ride to be dry."
344862,0,"I love MaryJane's. I've had black patent leather ones before. These ones are not as comfortable as other ones I've owned but maybe I'll break them in and they'll feel better.They run a little small. I should have gotten a 6 1/2 instead of a 6.THey look good though, isn't that what counts? haha!"
39027,1,"I find this shoe to be perfect for walking. I clock an average 7 miles a day on uneven ground. The sole is very comfortable, and the heel support is perfect to alleviate side to side movement. This is my 3rd pair of this shoe. I hope they keep making them......"
342856,1,These shoes are wonderful. The color is great and they arrived much quicker than I expected them to.
280576,1,"My husband wears these every day and, having had them for over a year now, there have been no problems yet. Great quality!"
288847,1,"Functionally, these shoes are great. They feel really good. I get good support on my problem feet, and I no longer have knee pain after running.I guess the only draw back is that these shoes look like ""medical"" shoes. The kind that would be prescribed to old folks with foot problems."
293553,1,"These are lovely, and they are the most comfortable shoes. They are floaty soft. I bought a size up and it seems to be perfect. Love these."
164715,0,Couldn't get my foot more than half way in. Liked the style very much but was not confident I would get the right size by reordering. Cost me ove 8 dollars to return the shoes.Easy Spirit Women's Motion Sport Lace Up/ camel
194467,1,Brought these for my mother and she stated that these were the most comfortable pair of sandals she owns. I would recommend these as good buy as it is very difficult to find wide width shoes
43486,1,My wife's using it for a while now. It proves to be a very durable product. She likes it very much.
156113,1,Great shoe very cute. True to size and good quality My 2 yr old lives them. She wears a 6.5. The first pair I ordered were (6.5) fit just right so I returned and ordered a 7. That was perfect with just a little room to grow.
103521,1,"This is my 2 year old's second pair of skechers ""crocs"". He loves them and wants to wear them all the time. I thought he might have a problem with them slipping off, but he took to them with no problem at all. I also love that they are nice and wide for toddler feet!"
64965,1,"I was delighted to find out that Keds still makes the sneakers I bought as a kid. I just wore out the last pair I had -- I purchased extras at least twenty years ago, so haven't had to look for new till now. Well, almost the same sneaker... These don't seem to be made to the same last as the old models; they aren't quite as good a fit, but are still pretty comfortable, and the sole is still flexible and light weight. The inside is lined with a terry-like material -- an improvement, I think, if it holds up to wear. The colored stripe around the outside of the bottom is gone. I'm sorry about that, as it gave them a more streamlined appearance. But unless these new Champions don't wear well, I will definitely look for more when I wear out these two pairs a decade from now."
368406,1,"They fit perfectly , they feel perfect , my favorite shoes . I will buy these again for sure. Love"
65317,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
234668,1,"Fast Shipping and was excellent deal. So far I have only worn it once, and it felt great. Didn't help the golf game though. I do recommend this purchase."
309617,0,"First off, the shoe I received is not the shoe pictured. I need plenty of support for my poor ole dogs and this shoe doesn't have it. It is truly a light walking shoe. I have since ordered the correct Easy Spirit and love them."
220821,0,"I have had my shoes for a couple of months now.At first they seemed a half size to small.And the toe looks more narrow than my feet.But after wearing them a while,they seem to be doing ok.The Gortex linning is also nice for puddle jumping."
142344,0,i bought these shoes for my 2-year-old son. But about two weeks after i recieved them i found pretty much the exact same thing in a national super-store for half of what i paid for these. i was disappointed. And i'm not sure how much my son likes the shoe going up on his ankle. Anyone looking to buy these shoes online should try some local stores first. i'm betting you'll find a better price.
5960,1,These shoes are to die for. I ordered them at 7pm and they were on my door step at 3pm the next day! Great fast shipping and amazing quality for what I paid.
154766,1,"Wonderfully comfortable right away. Perfect heel height as I am tall already (5-10). Sole is very flexible and durable. One CAVEAT.....the rivet fell off one of the straps and now I will have to pay to have repaired (have only worn 3 times so far!). Check to be sure rivets are secure!!!!!!! Other than this, great shoe! Would have given it 5 stars if this had not happened!!!!!"
70500,1,"This is my first review, which I am only doing because of the only other review. This is a great shoe for kids. I have soley used this shoe as my four year olds tennis shoes since he was one. If sized right (my son has extra wide feet), they are very long lasting. The shell toe does not wear down or become scuffed. He is on his 6th pair and not once had I need a replacement before he grew out of them. Great shoe!"
268963,1,"I'm using these shoes for their stated purpose - walking! This is my fourth pair of Rockport Walking shoes, and I wouldn't wear anything else for casual use. They are well-built, durable, and most of all, comfortable! I try to walk at least ten miles a week for exercise, and I get over a year and a half out of each pair. Definitely recommended!"
64140,1,Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado. Muchas gracias. Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.Saludos desde Venezuela
315991,1,Very nice shoes. Very confortable and just like i expect. In Portugal are shoes for 150&#8364;. Very beautiful model and confortable.
262906,1,"I enjoy them every time I wear them. Comfortable, sporty and hip enough so that my daughter's friends actually listen to me."
355119,1,I love shoes...I couldnt wait to get these...I had them in a few days and their great. I even got a pair for my son. I recomend the shoes and Amazon!!
260573,1,"These shoes were shipped quickly, and were exactly as described. My son is thrilled with them. Thanks!"
311674,1,My son was delighted with the sandals and so was I. The price was remarkable compared to retail. The sandals arrived quickly. It was a great experience. Thanks!
332121,1,"Amazon is the most incredible place and I wonder what I did before they started offering products other than books, movies and CDs. I live in a small town and the only place to shop is Wal-Mart, which isn't saying much if you want nice things. So, thank you, Amazon, for doing what you do. But this review is really supposed to be about the product I ordered - in this case, the Walking Cradles sandal known as ""Jenna"". Walking Cradles are the most comfortable shoes (other than my everyday Crocs!) that I've ever worn. And that's saying a lot in my case because I have a very hard-to-fit foot. It's wide and I have an extremely high instep. But these sandals fit like a dream, which is why I now have them in every color they make. And I wear a half size smaller than I do in a regular shoe because they offer the wide width. If you ever need a well-made, comfortable shoe, go with Walking Cradles; I do!"

Hope that the energy is resolved the actual problem because size problem is difficult to choose, the size that the amazon provides standard , not want to assume a reference with that size. If you like to have towel socks on ,my personal meaning is that big half yards alternative shoes , this way can make foot more spacious being well more."
190593,1,These shoes are really cute. They are true to size and look great on your feet. Nice for dress or pants. If you like Mary Jane's you will love these shoes
80845,1,"I really like these shoes. I use them for weightlifting/running. My only warning is that they run quite big. I had to order 1.5 sizes smaller than I usually do, but they work fine. My first pair got torn up a lot around the lace-holes, but I think that was because they were too big. My current pair has no problems so far."
303960,0,"I mistakenly ordered the wrong width, have reordered it but havn't recieved it yet, I hope it fits as it is a nice well made thong."
15203,1,"I am very satisfied with the shoes, I have 2 pairs."
209628,1,"These are more durable than any of my hiking boots or combat boots ever were, and far more comfortable than any of my other shoes - including my fuzzy slippers (though I must admit that the fuzzy slippers were a bit of a disappointment).I wear these for just about everything that doesn't require dress shoes now. If I had been smart enough to order them in black, I wouldn't need the dress shoes, either."
296874,1,My boyfriend loves his Clarks shoes and mostly what he wears. He will probably order the next new style and/or color.
76662,1,"I have been searching for years to find a pair of Deer Stags Plain Toe Oxfords in size 14. It is difficult to find any shoes in a size 14 here in rural Oregon, the few that I do find are poorly made, ugly, and expensive. Certain that I was doomed to a string of $75-$150 that were too small, ugly, and needing replacement in 6 months, I logged onto Amazon and was astounded to find these for less than $30. I had a pair of these before and they lasted and looked good for constant use through 5 years, 6 moves and 2 states. These are the most comfortable and durable shoe of this type that I have ever owned."
190601,1,I love these shoes. They are like feathers on my feet and have improved my dancing for recreation immensely.
215886,1,"Beautiful shoes. Outstanding birthday present for my daughter. Comfortable from the very beginning. Excellent price from Amazon. ""NO SHIPPING CHARGE"""
230987,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
27478,1,"I am an aspiring theater actress in graduate school and I needed some character shoes for rehearsing.The heel is a perfect height. I am used to wearing higher heels for 'going out' but these are great for acting, dancing, and moving in. They give you enough height to feel like a heel, but are low enough so you can actually do some REAL work. Sometimes high heels hurt and disconnect you from the much needed 'grounded' feeling when working.They are really comfortable, break in nicely, and are great for auditioning.They are a tad narrow so if you have wide feet opt for a wider size.I LOVE my Capezios!!!"
289293,1,item is just as described; works very well and does a good job of shining leather shoes
179565,1,"Zapatos de linea cl&aacute;sica, deportivos, ideales para el d&iacute;a a d&iacute;a, de extrema calidad. Super r&aacute;pido el envio al casillero en Miami. Compra desde Venezuela"
155832,1,"These shoes are incredibly comfortable, if not the most feminine-looking, but I needed some very casual shoes that were (not athletic shoes) comfortable for walking or standing for long periods of time at work, and these are awesome. My boyfriend has some Rockports that have the best most cushiony insoles and I was jealous of how comfy they looked. Now I have some for the days when I need the extra comfort! These are amazing, exactly what I needed when I can't wear athletic shoes to work but need to walk/stand for many hours."
143204,1,"These Olowahu sandals are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I live in the Fiji Islands, and the Teva Olowahu sandals are the ONLY shoes I wear. I cannot say enough about their durability--I have one pair that are now wearing out, but I've worn them for seven years, so they have become my house shoes! I have six pairs, but am looking forward to ordering a couple more pairs in different colors. Wonderful shoes!"
86846,1,"my son bought these with his own money and we were disappionted to find out the sizes run very large. Wasn't made very well, sides began falling apart. Wouldn't buy this one again. Did arrive quickly."
277256,1,"I love my Crocs - I have several pair, and would wear them with a suit if I thought I could get away with it. Sometimes the straps break, but hey - you don't really need them, anyway."
114095,2,"I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11. They run large, which is strange for being from the same company. They are super thin, light, and only stay comfortable for about a half hour. Afterwards your feet WILL hurt. I don't recommend them, even though they look cool. Comfort is a must, so I will be going back to my beloved 574's."
125595,1,"These slippers are so warm and comfy!! I keep them by the door when I step out of the house, so that when i come back I slip back into them. They are great in the morning, during the day, and when I want to cuddle up at night. They are cute, too. Not the typical ""nursing home booties"" you see in the store!"
312276,1,"My husband loves these shoes. He has a wide foot and it's very difficult to find loafers he can wear comfortably. The price, color (rust), and fit are excellent. The shoe looks great and required no breaking-in period. Highly recommended."
333221,1,"My fiance wanted these boots for so long, but I couldnt find them until now. This past christmas I bought them on amazon, and she loves them. I couldn't thank you enough."
239867,1,"I wear these all the time! I really like that they came with the yellow and white laces. They have become a total staple in my wardrobe. Comfortable, cute, and versatile."
90113,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
61454,1,This boot fits to size and is comfortable. I would purchase again. I use to purchase boots from LL Bean.
201540,1,"Top-Siders are the most comfortable (right from the first time you put them on), long-wearing, and versatile footwear I have ever owned. This purchase went easily and exactly as expected from order to payment to delivery."
51648,0,"I have really bad knees and was looking for something that offered stability and cushioning when walking. I usually buy inexpensive sneakers like DR Scholl's brand every few months, but thought I'd go for something more expensive for a change expecting it to be longer lasting and to offer more cushioning. Wrong! These were almost like walking with a wooden board tied to the bottom of my foot. They were unyielding and stiff and offered no cushioning. At first I thought it was just cuz they were new and needed to be broken in ... but after wearing them 5 days a week to work (8 - 10 hrs per day) for 2 weeks, I am seeing that they are still just as stiff and uncomfortable as the 1st day. They made my feet hurt just walking a few hundred feet and thus made my knees hurt worse than normal. They may help others with different problems but for ortho-arthritic knees, they are not a good choice! I won't buy this brand ever again."
239998,1,These are cute keds. My daughter has size 11 feet so it is hard to find shoes to fit her. These were just what she was looking for
208481,1,This was the very first time I have purcahsed a pair of shoes on line and the BEST Deal. I thought for the price I had paid I would not lose anything if I did not like them or if they did not fit. Well let me tell you they are nice and they fit perfect. I will buy now my shoes on-line. I am very happy with the shoes. Thanks Again I will be back soon to buy more. Aloha.
233287,1,"I ordered this product because i wanted a stash pocket like other ipath shoes. I was disappointed when i opened the box to find no stash pockets in the tongue. Its a, great comfortable shoe other than that."
38232,1,"The Skechers Alley Cat is a great all-around shoe...comfortable enough to wear walking or hiking, but dressy enough to wear with khakis and a button down. I wear it to work every day and find that it's so comfortable that I prefer to wear it with my jeans on the weekend than a pair of sneakers. I wore my first pair of the Skechers Alley Cat for about 5 years before I decided to get a new pair...and I purchased the exact same shoe. I highly recommend it."
10958,1,"This is about the 5th pair of these boots purchased. Very comfortable, easy to wear. Light to wear every day. Very pleased with these boots. Mens and womens are equally wearable."
296001,1,"Simple device that functions extremely well on icy surfaces. Light weight, compact, and easy to use. A great way to keep from slip sliding away."
124200,1,This purchase was a replacement product and therefore a known entity. It is a good and useful summer sandal that meets a need. Ordering and shipping were on schedule and as described.
364949,1,I absolutely love the style of Chucks but my one piece of advise is to wear thicker socks if you want comfort.
302660,0,"Crocs are my footwear of choice year round, most activities for last five years. Only issue I had with these is the color was not purple as shown. They were magenta and I returned them as I wanted purple."
340237,2,"I wore these shoes to the gym (powerlifting requires flat soles) no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time. After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped (on the opening, between the toe and heal, inside edge).Guess I'll skip the lo top next time."
207462,1,"I purchased a pair of the Reebok Rampante II soccer cleats and I have to say that they are some of the best boots I have ever worn. I have a wide foot but they formed nicely without making my foot feel cramped. (People with a narrow foot do not be discouraged, they will suit you fine.) The ""Total Control"" resin injections offer a great feel on the ball and my freekicks have improved greatly. I was wearing the Adidas Predator Mania before so to improve upon that is something in itself. The Rampante II is much lighter and offers a much better feel on the foot and the ball. It is one of the best investments I have ever made."
60108,1,"This is my second pair of Hi-Tec Altitude IV boots and I really like them, the waterproofing is great. I only wish they came in a narrow width as the medium is a little loose for my B width foot."
51222,1,"My husband had broken his arm a couple of months ago and I needed a bag that did not need to be carried. Found the Baggallini Rolling Tote on your web pages and after reading about the different zippered pockets I felt it was exactly what I was looking for. We were flying across country and staying for two months so I had papers, medicines and my laptop that needed to be in a carry-on. The center section was for a laptop and mine fit very nicely. Our medicines fit in the larger rear section and could be accessed during the trip. Our important papers fit in the front section and also were accessible. The bag fit under the seat in front of us with ease. Neither one of us could lift it up to the overhead bins, we are too short. I feel that buying this tote is the best purchase I have made in a long time. Money well spent. I should also say that I received the tote in good time. I ordered it about the middle of January and received it within 10 days. We were flying out on Feb. 1, 2011.Baggallini Rolling Tote Bag"
69602,1,"Crocs, I've found, are something people either love or they hate. I happen to love them and have numerous pairs in many colors. I've reached the stage in my life where comfort is a priority. I truly have never found a more comfortable shoe. All the written and other media articles about safety on escalators are overblown, to my mind. Accidents with these shoes always seem to involve children who are likely standing too close to the edges of the escalator stairs. I've ridden many escalators and have had no problems with any of my Crocs."
177274,1,"I was debating whether I wanted to buy a pair online or just go into a store and buy them there. Boy am I glad I went to go buy them in person... as other people have mentioned, Converse run a little big so a size 11 (which I am) is really a 9 or so. I ended up getting an 8/5 and I haven't worn 8/5 size shoes since I was 13. You really want to go and buy them in person and completely avoid this problem."
126147,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
384467,0,I normally wear a 5 - 5.5 M I got this in a 6M and fits great. the 5M is too short. ONLY reason i did not give 5 stars is because the black color rubs off on the soles of my feet and doesn't wash off too easily.
117469,1,"got these, in brown leather ""croc"" for my husband who saw them someplace but had a very hard time finding them in his size (12) - he loves them - they're super comfortable and very good looking. For Reef lovers, and flipflop lovers, we highly recommend."
6938,1,"Bought a pair of these a couple months ago. The styling isn't too bad, but they fit my foot so nice I have since bought 4 more new pairs to have later, before they get discontinued everywhere."
186308,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
328068,1,"I bought these prior to going hiking for a couple of weeks in the Tetons and in Yellowstone. I wore them practically every day and found them to be incredibly comfortable. While I have narrow feet and these only come in medium width (my reason for 4, not 5 stars), they are adjustable enough to fit comfortably. It was great to be able to hike along a path and ford streams without changing or removing my shoes, and getting through airport security was a snap. I would not hesitate to recommend these sandals to others, and they look great too."
369284,1,"Been using my pair for 2 years now. They are durable and quite comfortable. What I love about New Balance is that they are available in many widths, mine is 4E. It is almost impossible for me to find a pair in shopping malls. This one fits perfectly. I think the price is not too steep compared to other brands.It is my everyday shoes for work and recreation. It is described as walking shoes but I also use it for some light jogging & tennis. Nice minimalistic simple design. Leather is supple...and yes, the biggest reason I bought it is velcro."
67809,1,"I love this boot. I rarely order shoes over the internet, but these caught my eye. They look good and they feel wonderful. I wore them all day and my feet were not uncomfortable. They keep my feet warm in snow and cold weather. I am so happy I bought these boots."
359887,1,"I'm what I like to call, ""hard to fit"" when it comes to shoes. I have a wide foot and can wear anything from a size 9 to a size 10.5, depending on how the shoe is made and what sort of shoe it is. For example- in sneakers, I tend to purchase a 9 to 9.5- again, depending on how the sneaker is made. If its heels, I purchase anywhere from a 9.5 to a 10.5, depending on the width of the toe and the height of the heel. It really just depends on the shoe. I relate all this to relate my experience with this particular pair of shoes.I purchased the size 10.5 W and they're an absolutely perfect fit. The inside lining is soft and nicely padded- super comfy! I'm wearing these shoes for a play that requires me to be on my feet almost continuously for several hours and I have yet to experience any foot fatigue.Since I am fairly tall, I wanted something with a teeny bit of heel for a feminine look, but not so tall that I tower over the man who plays opposite me in the show. These shoes have a perfect height heel for me.I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone who will be on their feet for long periods of time.*One little note to mention- as with most character/dancing shoes, the bottom is quite slippery. If you're not adding taps, you may want to consider adding some rubber traction panels to the bottoms."
156472,0,I love the feel of this shoe but even in 7.5 it's a little snug. I might go back to Reebok.
284252,0,"The color of the shoe is much, much darker than the photo on Amazon. The picture looks medium brown. I suppose with &#34;antique coconut&#34; I should have realized that they meant the very dark outside of the coconut and not believed the &#34;picture&#34; as reference"
46006,1,"This shoe has saved my knees! I went to a running store and the guys fitted me with these shoes. I have been fighting knee problems for over a year! I have always picked out my own shoes. Obviously picking out some wrong ones! Now I have these. Now I am getting another pair cause I just love, love them. They are saving my knees!"
238690,1,Great product. I can wear all shoes in comfort and plan to order another one so thatI can stretch a pair together.
80124,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
31175,1,"This sandal is a good ""house shoe"" in winter, but is great for boys who need something that will stay put and yet come off fast when needed. Also is perfect for little ones who don't know how to tie laces yet."
58822,1,"shoes are supportive, and wear well on both roads and trails."
64995,1,"The brand ""Keds"" speaks for itself. But I got it at a great price and came in just a few days. Like the fact they come in different widths."
293963,1,This is my son's second pair of the SAME shoe! He loves them. They are comfortable for his wide little feet.The only complaint I have is that the tongue of the often moves to the side and doesn't stay straight in the shoe....but my boy doesn't care!
177281,0,"I bought these around New Years, and by June, the sole was already breaking apart and the back of the heel was deteriorating. I stopped wearing them regularly and they eventually wore down further and got few holes in the canvas right above the sole. I was expecting a little higher quality unfortunately. :\"
320189,0,Although these shoes are really very nice looking they are unfortunately one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have tried to wear. They're ok for a couple of hours as long as you do not need to wald a distance.
6582,1,The items arrived on time and were exactly as advertised. We could not have been happier. My sone wears them most every day.
143349,1,My son loves this item. He wears them all the time even during the rainy season. It is close to real as you can get. It goes well with the fabric style fire suit and the toy accessories.
274278,1,I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: &#34;These boots are great. Completely waterproof. They are very comfortable on my feet and fit perfectly.&#34;
343831,2,"My son wore these off and on for a month when school started. Both shoes, the soles started to come off. The right one came off almost completely. Don't know if this was just a bad pair or what but I wouldn't order these particular Converse shoes again."
200591,0,"These shoes are very ccmfortable. A little bit short but since there are no half sizes, the next size would be too large. My feet get really hot in them but for the most part I am happy with my purchase."
247116,0,"Very comfortable shoes. I have bought this brand/type of shoe for some time. What I dislike the most are the lousy shoe strings. I have to double knot them and stopped doing that many, many years ago. The material used for the shoe strings is terrible. Small but annoying issue, even when just walking. Dancing, is another issue when the strings come untied.Shoes, this price should have the regular cloth strings."
153687,2,"Cute, good color, but not the comfort I expect from Naturalizer; heel slipped but otherwise did seem true to size"
191972,1,I recently got these for my husband for Christmas. He loves them sometimes a little too much. He thinks they are more grey than brown. They are brown.
292365,1,Had several pairs of these in the past and they were the most comfortable ever! So glad they're still available.
317341,1,"I've owned NB 609s for years meaning more than 7. I just flat wear these shoes out and it takes a long time before they need replacing. The NB 609s give me some great value for my money. I have two pair right now that I swap every other day. They holdup very nicely and are very comfortable. I will give kudos to the review who said be careful when on a wet floor. I too have fallen in a store who had a wet floor. Just be aware and you'll be ok. For me, they're great shoes."
56079,1,Have been wearing Keds for years. Had to go to a larger size because I need thicker insoles. They're great!
107160,1,I always liked the look of a loafer and this shoe with its high heel makes a great dress shoe with either nice denim jeans or a pant suit.They fit great and were nice and comfortable even with the heel height.
363163,1,"I've been wanting Converse high-top tennis shoes for years now, and my husband just recently purchased them for me for my birthday. I have weak ankles from years of hiking, past injuries, etc. The high top style gives my ankles more support. I only wish they had arch support and then I'd be in complete heaven. However, these are tops in my book, plus they look stylish! I love how they stay in style no matter what! Thanks!"
35041,1,I live in these Dansko clogs. I have been wearing these exclusively for 10 years and my feet complain when I wear anything else (except my hiking boots). These are perfect for my job as a teacher!
41042,1,"I love reef flips. This is a nice flip; however, I would order one size larger if I had known."
381700,1,"I bought these for a Lara Croft Costume. They were comfy and perfect fit!! Not sure if i'll ever wear them again, but for that price, thats okay!!"
96820,1,I have had several pairs of this shoe. Looks good and feels great plus I wear a 101/2 which is hard to find. Ido not know why manufacturers of shoes think that after 10 they only make whole sizes. Will probably buy other colors of this shoe.
376458,1,I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He likes it. It is sturdy and works fine for him to take money with him.
230847,1,"Perfect! I'm very happy with my excelent buy. The sport shoes are perfectly paking and it came very fast. I place my order only 11 days ago, and I'm from Spain. I'm very pleasant with Amazon. Sure, I goingo to do another buy. Thanks a lot because this model of adidas isn't in Spain and is easy buy with you. Sara"
218332,1,I bought these basically since my other shoes were worn out and I noticed with certain weight lifting routines such as squats and dead lifts my weight would shift easy. I needed something close to the ground and not much cushion and these were it. I found with my other shoes I would start to slowly shift forward or backwards on them since they were so cushioned and I found myself off balance a lot. These shoes cleared that up for me but I will say arch support is almost nonexistant so I had to go find some small inserts because they were kind of uncomfortable at first and these things are kind of thin too. So if you go with inserts make sure they aren't very thick. I highly recommend not running in these since they don't have supports or very much cushion at all. They are good for walking but I cannot imagine running a mile or so in them without crippling foot pain.I didn't buy these at Amazon since I wanted to make sure I liked them before I bought them. I didn't really buy them for any fashion or anything since I could really care less about that. The color is what I like since I really don't like Chuck Taylors that have white and another color. The black was perfect for me since it basic fit my color palette of clothing I wear. My wife says they look good on me so I will take her word for it but than again she may be humoring herself. These were my first pair of Converses and for the price you really cannot go wrong since I can imagine myself hanging onto these for a good amount of time.
17002,1,"I owned probably 5 pairs of the Kaisers (the calfskin version of the Copas, back when they existed) several years ago. I was a solid 12, 12.5 back then. Now I'm apparently an 11, and my feet are the same size I'm pretty sure. Just wanted to give people a heads-up, since unlike Zappos you don't get free send-backs if you order the wrong size.Otherwise, a great cleat as always! I'm glad they still make these."
219810,1,"I was very pleased to get these shoes, they're very iconic no matter where you go and look great with just about any casual outfit. But after about 10 months of having these, rips between the rubber parts of the shoe and the cloth began to seperate. I'm not sure whether this is due to how my feet fit within the shoe. After trying to fix the seams myself, the shoes soon began to just fall apart really and just became really unwearable. If they were cheaper I would consider getting a second pair and maybe another different pair of shoes along with them. Overall they're still nice shoes, but they may need to be pampered somewhat for them to last a long time."
200863,1,I received my shoes in time. Great product. I recommend it to anyone. I think the price was reasonable because the shoes are very well made.
104923,1,"These shoes are comfortable enough, if a little stiff. I do like the color--I get mixed reactions and I don't really care. They were a decent price."
338474,1,An Excelent choice. They are very good for everyday use. Accesible price. I am very satisfied and I recommend it.
292387,1,"These are great shoes for work in an office. They are comfortable all day and look very nice with several styles from business casual to professional. Thanks for another great pair of shoes, Softspots!"
128644,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
4042,1,I'm have never been disappointed with a Hi-Tech shoe. The Altitude is a fantastic boot and nicely priced. My last pair lasted four year and I just bought another. Better waterproofing than my gore-tech hikers. I try other hikers but I keep coming back to Hi-Tec.
286227,1,"I understand from my stepdaughter, her daughter loves the uggs, i have no other comment just using up required space"
216536,1,"my son bought these with his own money and we were disappionted to find out the sizes run very large. Wasn't made very well, sides began falling apart. Wouldn't buy this one again. Did arrive quickly."
43705,0,"Shoe is a bit narrow. The heel is higher than I wanted-2"". Could use more padding in the ball of shoe, which is where you put your weight when your dancing. I'm a beginner dancer and the leather sole is slippery even after using sand paper to rough it up. (I found a suede sole to be less slippery for a beginner.)"
262093,2,"I have not yet received this product, the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month. And when I attempt to track I get no where, no one is available to answer my concerns..... so right now I don't know how I feel about this product! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for."
256163,1,"Great shoe, very comfortable, excellent fit. Very pleased with this purchase. Narrow width hard to find so these are great."
117405,1,"My mother-in-law has so much trouble finding comfortable shoes Between diabetes & problems that should be surgically corrected, but her high blood pressure prohibits surgery, finding shoes is like the proverbial needle in a hay stack search. Aetrex offered a full grain leather comfort shoe with velcro closures for easy adjustment. One look & I thought,""That's the shoe for Mom!""...and it was! She put them on, grabbed her cane, & wore them for her weekly shopping outing, & kept them on when we arrived back home. Amazing!!! Thanks, Amazon, for leading me in the right direction, & thanks to Aetrex, also, for solving the comfort dilemma!"
106551,0,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
40883,1,"I love this flip flop! It's sooo comfortable and has some arch support. Size was true to form. I highly recommend buying a pair! The only thing that I didn't like is that I got the brown flip flop with the white thong, and the white is getting noticeably dirty. I will definitely be buying more!!!"
184747,1,"Love, love, the arch support, have bought others with much less and more $$. I got the brown and black and they are my every day sandals, very comfortable. I buy size 8 and can sometimes do a 7/1/2 but size up to an 8 in these. Fits perfectly."
192056,1,"Yea yea, Im told the 2090's would be nice too, but I sport a 4E foot, and very few shoes fit and perform like these 2070's. Though most extra wide models are styled for cloppy clydesdales, not hundred-fifty-nuthins like me, I train and run marathons in the 2070's. I forgot how many years ago they stopped making them, but thank God they are still around. Counting Boston 2004, I have logged six marathons in 2070's, and based on the stockpile in my closet, I'll be running Boston 2007 in them. But don't go by me, the manufacturer's want you to buy THIS YEAR'S SHOE, ooooooh,ooooooh, new colors and torsion bars for the super spension.......Whatever works I say. Hopefully ASIC's sweatshop in We-dont-have-indoor-plumbing-province on the other side of earth can still crank these out for me when I need more! Hell, I'll buy em all lunch!"
219432,1,I love my keds. In fact they are better then my converses. Best decision I've bought online. The price was a little high but worth it
165905,0,Not a very sturdy shoe compared to other Saucony I have bought. OK for day to day wear but would not run in it.
152940,0,The purchase was for a gift. Personally if I had made the purchase for myself I would have preferred that the boots were water-resistant. I think they are priced too high for not being suitable for winter type weather
288390,1,"These shoes fit comfortably for me and look very nice. I was not disappointed. However, I did check out the style at a local store before purchasing online. My size is hard to find so I purchase online."
327374,1,"I just bought these black shoes, after having the tan ones for about 5 months. These are so very comfortable. They feel like ballet slippers. They do not have much rubber under the front half of the shoe, but have a decent amount under the heel. They are easy to slip on and off, and i have gotten a good amount of complements on the tan ones."
197551,1,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
92436,1,"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But, not PINK! (Apparently, you couldn't find size 12 mens in hot pink. Oh, well.)But, if you're a newcomer to Chucks, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers."
14095,0,"I bought these slippers for my husband who has a shoe size of 11. The size 11 slippers do not fit him, he could not even get the bridge of his foot in. They do not have larger size, so I ended up returning them. We were disappointed, because they look so comfortable and we were looking forward to them."
3990,1,"Since discovering Hi Tec some 15 years ago and found it to be the perfect fit for my size 11 feet (womens) I have stuck to the brand for hiking boots. They are stylish, waterproof, well crafted and a brilliant fit for a broad foot. This is a boot you can walk in all day and not have sore feet; I have never had one blister and they require no breaking in. In recent times I have been unable to source this brand in Western Australia, and when I finally found a store that carried them they were twice the price offered by Amazon. And thanks to Amazons sizing chart the mens size 9 translated perfectly. I have yet to be disappointed by Hi Tec which is why I have found it unnecessary to try other brands. The Altitude rates as the best to date. I cannot recommend this boot highly enough."
110486,1,"These shoes are very sexy! I love the red heel. It makes them different from other leopard print shoes. They look great and they're fairly comfortable. They are stilettos so the comfort level made me give them 4 stars. I had to order them twice. I know that the leopard spots are random, but the shoes I received looked totally different. One shoe had more spots than the other and it was darker. The insoles kept coming off when I took off the shoes. Also, I could see some glue at the tip of the shoes. I notified Amazon and they totally took care of everything and received a replacement right away. My replacement shoes are better. The spots are distributed better and they are the same color. However one of the insoles still come off, but I'll just glue it down myself. They are true to size for me. My right foot felt a bit tighter than my left and that never happens to me with other shoes. They'll stretch out in time so I'm not worried about that. I recommend purchasing these shoes. My only complaint is the problem with the insoles. Other than that, these shoes are fantastic!"
105354,0,"These boots were too big so I returned them. I couldn't find my size in the red, so I never got the durango boot."
150305,1,"I ordered this shoe in black leather with black patent trim. It would have been the perfect dressy flat shoe and I even ordered two sizes to try. Alas, neither fit well enough and both were uncomfortable. Hated having to send them back. I'm still searching for a comparable shoe."
257338,1,"Extremely fast shipping on this product, and the price was wonderful! I know my son will love them on his birthday! THANX!"
178929,1,My son absolutely loved this shoes. They came in perfect condition. The best part was I did not have to hunt them down locally.
143209,1,I actually bought these at DSW since I had a coupon. I'm glad I got to try them on. I was pregnant at the time and wasn't sure how they'd fit. I'm normally a 7.5 but I got a 7. They were slightly snug at first but after a few wears - they're perfect. They never hurt my feet even when I was breaking them in. Love them.
35906,1,"I've been looking for a great looking shoe that my toddler can't take off. These are perfect. Since they're high tops, I lace them up all the way, double knot them, and I don't have to worry about him losing a shoe in the store. The only problem with Chuck Taylors are that they're somewhat difficult to put on my son's wide feet. I can tell that they're fine and comfortable once I put them on him, but I have to spend a lot of time loosening up and re-tightening the laces. I did go a size larger than my son's normal shoe size because his feet are kind of wide, and they fit perfectly. Really, you can't go wrong with Chucks."
372595,1,"Very cool shoes, decent price and a very quick shipper. what more could you ask for?"
290827,1,"I have black in color in wide which fits me well. Its comfortable to wear for any occasion with khakis or dress pants or with suits. Sharp, leather upper and inner and soft sole so your feet won't hurt while standing or walking around. Great for office work, business or executive environment. This shoe qualifies to be tactical in terms of quality, durability, looks, price wise. :)"
156416,2,"I bought a pair of Women's Plainview less than a year ago. I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months, so that the upper part is still very new and nice. Yet, I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there, which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes, I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand. I don't expect shoes to last forever, but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line. This brand does not meet that minimum requirement."
344840,2,"I have worn Justin Brand boots for 20+ years and I really thought these were fake when I first put them on. These are stiff, rubber soled, with a very thin insole. My 10 year old Justin boots were comfortable the first time I put them on so I bought 2 pair. My previous Justin boots were the best most comfortable shoes I ever wore so I am very surprised by these.I pay about this much to have a new sole put on my old Justin boots so it seemed like a bargain until I tried them on. My cobbler says he can't replace the soles because they are rubber. He can only replace leather soles. I deleted every clothing item I was considering to buy from my Amazon wish list. I was just so disappointed."
200795,0,"I got these shoes hoping to wear them to work, wanting to replace a pair of Rockport topsiders that are starting to wear out. The sole on these isn't really great for standing for 8 hours at a time, so now I just wear them for going out."
116136,1,Ordered these shoes for my granddaughter's first dance class. They run a little small so I had to send the first pair back and get a size larger. Perfect for a 3 year old.
71753,0,"I absolutely love these boots and, being in Seattle, they are extremely useful. After about 6 months of wear, the heel of the right boot split, however, including the lining. I did a number with some superglue and green duct tape, which has seemed to hold up. I haven't had any problems with leaky boots while splashing through the puddles.They are about $10 cheaper on Amazon than on the company's website . . . FYI. I &lt;3 Amazon.com."
95907,1,I love this shoe. I've been looking for a flat comfortable shoe and Enzo is the one. I really love that fact that I was able to get this particular shoe on sale less that half the regular price and in large size. I have ordered several more colors and I love them all.
152322,1,"I think that Dr. Marten's shoes, besides being very confortable to even walk far distances, its price is very reasonable, they last untill you are 'tired' of seeing them in your dressing room."
162323,1,I love my Converse. A Chuck Taylor is always stylish!! And they always look good with casual clothing.
14275,1,"Bought these for our 15yr old son at the beginning of High Soccer season. Best soccer shoes he's ever owned. Made it thru August, Sept and Oct with either 2 hours of games or practices at least 5 days per week with minimal wear. The insoles were the first to go, however, he's still playing in the shoes over the winter because they are more comfortable than the Diadoras he wanted to try next. The shoes come with leather conditioner - we used it about every two weeks plus we kept cedar shoe trees inside the shoes when not in use. Some other brands may be a few ounces lighter, but I doubt you'll be as happy with them."

179658,1,"I ordered these for my 18 year old son. He LOVES them. Has a purple shirt that he wears with them - bought them about 10 months ago and he has worn them so much that they are almost worn out - that's how much he likes them. I would buy him more, but he is going into the military soon. Love Lo Purple Chuck Norris Converse! Thanks Amazon."
99081,1,I have a very picky daughter when it comes to clothing... We went all over the place looking for some new shoes for school... She couldn't find anything that she liked so when I got home I gave her Amazon.com and had her look here.... She quickly picked these shoes and I ordered them.... They arrived three days later and she loves them.....Not one complaint!
232012,1,They are the same as the last pair. Will buy them again if available whem this pair wears out! ! !
41723,1,"This shoe has no ""break in"" period. This has to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have every worn straight from the box. I hope they hold up, seems to."
169466,1,very happy with this shoe I love the way they look I am slightly crippled and issue is extremely comfortable
285281,1,"My daughter wanted these timberland for Christmas, she has purchase them before so I known what she wanted. These are very nice boots"
296075,1,Excellent product at a very good price. Vendor service on this transaction was excellent!
349896,1,"I had been looking for a pair of pink tennis shoes. Online I found the color that I wanted, I'm very pleased."
153406,1,I ordered these in 71/2 wide. I usually wear a 7 but need a 71/2 in these shoes. They are very comfortable and I intend to order more in other colors.
298743,0,"Hard to find crocs (or any shoes) reasonably priced in my size (14).Fit is good, just not so comfortable with the knobby things on the inside of the top of shoe. I pretty much have to wear a lightweigh sock with them for comfort. Otherwise happy with them."
235341,1,This shoe is awesome. Well built and very comfortable. The lacing system is a bit flaky as you do not want to tighten your shoe to much fear of ripping the inside eyelets. Delivery was super fast and hassle free. Make sure you put on a leather protector.
26134,1,"I used to rave about Nike's but after getting a pair of these New Balance's, I don't think I'll ever buy another pair. They are waaaaay comfortable.It's like walking on a big comfy couch.It's nice that they come in width's for people with narrow feet to wide feet. Go try a pair on and get your sizing correct before ordering online.And they're made in the good ol' USofA."
255790,1,Once I find a good sneaker I stay with it. The toe box is roomy and the inner sole comes out to fit my orthotic. My back feels better also when I walk. I know it is a running shoe but this is the best walker for me.
194687,2,"I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer ""Scout"" pair which I already own and love. I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic. I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However, after receiving them, they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout. They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money. The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper, padded sole, and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather. The sole is not padded and sinks in. The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone"
240306,1,I love these sandals!!! Had purchased a pair from the mall a couple years back and of course the dog got to them. Was so happy to have found these on Amazon! They are very comfortable and even have arch support! Would recommend these to anyone.
238172,1,"I purchased black Life-Stride Malibu sandals during the summer. They are comfortable and I love to wear them all the time. They look nice with shorts, jeans or dresses. The temperature is often warm here so I wear them often."
66411,1,My daughter was so thrilled to receive these wonderful shoes for christmas this year. They were different and that is why she liked them. They came in perfect shape and I couldn't ask for it to have been a better experience. Thank you so much!
130719,0,"I'm sure this would be a fine shoe if it fit. Ordered a size 9w. It was a about a inch less in length than the size 9 I normally wear. Return was free, but I am disappointed that the size did not conform to what I thought was a standard."
279397,0,I liked the shoe because of it's support to my ankles but it doesn't do to much if you have flat feet.
345570,1,This is a great pair of shoes and also fun to wear with a lot of compliments.
371757,0,I bought these boots after reading reviews. I am not that impressed with them. I like that they are lighter than my danners and have the side zip which is a ten. These boots would be four stars if the insole was better. After wearing them for 2 ten hour shifts my feet hurt bad. There are no support provided from these boots and this is the first time the arches of my feet have hurt. I will be trying out Dr. Scholls or something to make the boots feel more comfy. I usually like 5.11 products but will not buy another boots made by them.
255888,1,"What a really cute comfortable pair of shoes and for me that is no easy task! I have wide wide feet and I'm diabetic which means they have to fit good or my feet really hurt. Now lots of brands claim they are wide or wide,wide but they are NOT and I end up walking on a seam!! not good for diabetic feet. I was afraid I was doomed to wear crocs forever (they are really comfortable but not cute!) I saw these and just had to give them a try.Boy am I glad I did. They are a perfect fit!! I love the fact that the insole can be taken out and replaced which I did with my diabetic insoles. They were measured for me at the medical supply to be a perfect fit and they fit in this shoe perfectly!!! from toe to heel and from side to side.Thank you Easy Spirit for a truely wide wide shoe!!These come in so many colors that I am just gonna have to have other colors.LOL:) Yes I recommend this product. I can wear an 8 but not knowing the sizing for this shoe I ordered an 8 1/2 WW. I could wear an 8 in these but like a little extra toe room. They arrived very fast."
201087,0,"Hi, we purchase clothing and shoes from all over the world and only the US is significantly different.The US sizes are much smaller and this was not obvious on this web site.Other retailers around the world advise which sizing range is used, including some via Amazon.Or, they clearly marked which country sizing they were using.It should be clear on the website which sizing the retailer is using.On the plus side, the shoes were delivered as ordered, on time and in good condition.RussellAustralia"
203488,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
288125,0,"Straps need more holes to tighten, and I find it difficult to make new ones, so to the shoe repair shop."
380590,0,"I purchased these shoes a half size larger than I normally wear and found them still very tight. Toe area is quite narrow. Otherwise, well made and good height for dancing."
266596,1,"Want to add my recommendation for a great waterproof boot. Why pay more? Going on two years of use, trail hiking, backpack camping, urban hiking and an occasional run. It's that comfortable. Need the support of a full-height boot and this one gives good ankle protection. Waded through streams up to my ankles and kept my feet absolutely dry partly due to the gusseted tongue. Deep multi-directional lugs give great traction even on the muddiest trail. Cleans up pretty well also. Showing a little wear around the heel and toe, but attribute that to walking and jogging on concrete and asphalt since the lugs look in perfect shape. Otherwise bullet-proof. Could be lighter but would not trade this for a less durable boot. Will probably buy this boot again when this one wears out, but who knows when that will be?"
253772,1,I ordered this shoe for my son. He wanted a good skate shoe. I wanted a reasonable price. We got both.
63305,1,"This is probably my 10th pair of these sneakers. I wear them to death. Not fancy...comfortable...goes with all casual clothing and very ""smart"" looking. Very Audrey Hepburn."
159550,1,"Shipping was way fast, this is my 5th pair of Chucks the black on black is slick, they breath better than any other shoe ive ever owned and it definitely wont be my last pair."
123929,2,These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size. I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks. The shoe literally slipped of my foot.
359871,1,"These shoes are really comfortable! I usually wear a wide shoe, and I ordered a whole range of sizes in wide, but I ended up going with my street shoe size anyway. If you have wide feet, these shoes are wonderful in wide! Even if you don't usually wear wide size shoes, I imagine if you ordered wide, you wouldn't have to order up a shoe size. In any case, I recommend ordering a few different sizes to see how they feel. I've worn them to several 4-hour rehearsals now and I love them!"
48659,1,"I like them, it just that the straps are a little uncomfortable. Otherwise, these are pretty."
373282,1,"I wasn't looking for a ""security"" wallet or a ""hidden"" wallet, so this wallet works just fine for me. I like to wear it around my wrist, so slippage and/or temperature doesn't matter. I've been wearing my own design/creation of wrist wallet for decades, but it's black and I wanted something in a neutral colour. I simply wear the wallet as an accessory like an arm band. If people ask what it is, I either tell them it's a wrist wallet or I just shrug and say it's a wrist brace."
251478,1,"I know I wear these shoes more often than I should, there are days when I should probably wear dressier shoes, but I wear one of my pairs of Easy Spirit Motions Sport Lace-ups everyday because they are so comfortable. They seem quite durable too."
284322,1,"This is a great sandal. This is the 3rd pair I have purchased for my husband. He wears them everywhere. I even slip my feet into them occasionally to do work around the house because of the great arch support. The sandals are a bit expensive, but they have lasted up to 2 years each pair. If you think of the cost in terms of how long they last , then you are really getting a deal. They conform to your feet. These particular sandals have the soft straps. This particular style of Birkenstock is the only style I would recommend because the soft straps do not hurt the top or sides of your feet while you are breaking them in."
342065,0,"Somehow I don't feel comfortable when there are two belts or shoelaces not linked anywhere. Their width is not equal. So if I sew them on the shoes, that won't look nice. The shoes may not need a lace to tie tight. But to secure, the laces may still be needed. So I will return the shoes."
36506,0,I bought them thinking they would be like my keds I've own for sometime. The are called the original. They looked the same unless you get really close and see the inside isn't terry cloth they are cheaper made. I bought a med it is what I wear but i'm in the process of trying to stretch them out. Wetting them and putting them over objects to stretch them since they are so tight. Length is right but they are narrow now with wetting them the blue from the soles have come up and i'll now have to deal with that. So what can I say - could have returned them you have always been great but thought I could stretch them out since i've been unable to find the ked original in the store.
338442,1,"quick response, fast delivery, great shoes for just about any outfit."
16941,1,"My son likes these shoes, they are comfortable with soft leather. They look old school. I am surprised that soccer shoes have progressed with advanced in soles with arch supports. I have not seen any with them."
335992,1,"The shoes were for my nephew, it fits perfectly, is comfortable and nice to wear during hot days."
321599,1,"I bought the first pair and within 2 weeks the leather ripped near the stitching at the top of the shoe. In all fairness I do have wide feet but this brand is supposed to be a quality brand. Amazon was absolutely wonderful about replacing the shoes. Now with the weather being colder, I haven't had a chance to wear them. Hope they hold up this time."
370124,1,Just what I expected from this trusted name brand. No problems. Fast shipping and good price. Soft leather. Bought a 1/2 size bigger than street shoe size.
171989,1,i wear a size 7 1/2 shoe and that's what i got in these and they fit perfect. they also look better in person then in the picture. for 19.99 thay were a great buy.
19827,2,"This was my first purchase of a Rockport shoe and I expected a lot more due to all of the glowing reviews of this model. I ordered a 12M and the shoes were the correct size, but the tongue on the left shoe dug into my ankle bone while walking (others have mentioned this issue as well). I wore them an entire day at my office job to see if I could get over it, but a shoe shouldn't be this uncomfortable during break-in. The stock insoles feel thin and unsupportive as well. The support improved when I put in some aftermarket insoles from my old shoes, but they still chew on my ankle. The overall stitching, leather, and build quality look good but that doesn't make up for discomfort. Some people have mentioned the World Tour's sold by Amazon are Grade ""B"" shoes...I'll have to test that theory if I find a retail store that stocks them. Unfortunately I've only seen the ""Eureka"" model in stores. Returning this set for a refund."
120424,1,"I am a young and active woman, but sometimes I find that I get more attention from men than I would like. I tried getting a bad perm, not wearing makeup and gaining weight, but men are determined, and I kept getting hit on.Finally, I found the answer: TEVAS. I slipped on a pair of these and sure enough, men were running from me like Japanese people running from Godzilla. I can't get a date to save my life and I am loving all this free time. Thanks to Tevas, I am 100% man-repellant, and I can finally get some work done."

342091,1,"I was a little hesitant on ordering a shoe without being able to try it on first but it was well worth the effort!It's a comfortable shoe and it gives good support. I like the colour. It's held up quite well since I ordered it more than a year ago! If they get a bit scuffy, they wipe clean pretty easily!"
50754,0,The style and fit are fantastic but........ my pair has an odor from day 1 that I just can't get rid of. I even get busted by my team members. I really do like these shoes though and would hope they all don't have the problem I am still experiencing. PS I'm sure I could have sent them back for a different pair.
269183,1,"I tried surfing for the best price at shoe stores, but Amazon found me the best price at Bealls, in Florida. I walk on hospital cement floors all day. Rockports are more comfortable all day for me than other brand names I have tried. Thanks Amazon.com!"
284801,0,"Light weight and soft but, the size 7 was more like a size 8. Not as good as the wanted brand ( same style, material)."
228445,0,"I have recived the converse shoe yesterday.. opened the box and took a close look at them, really do not like the finish and they really do not look original to me. i am thinking of returnig them"
95660,1,This was the second time I ordered this pair of shoes for my husband. He has been very happy with this comfortable pair. No more foot pain! The shoes are wide to fit him well. He now wears the old pair around the house as a work shoes. Thanks for the great products.
351677,0,"I got this months ago and honestly I never wear them, the size is a bit tricky, it's a bit short and narrow, my feet are narrow already, but they still are uncomfortable in these shoes. It's my first Minnetonka shoes and I don't think I'll get a second pair."
10873,1,"I have enjoyed my Rockport Harmony Boot, the color, the wide calf and wider width is what I needed for comfort. I could not find this special sized boot in the Department stores."
324829,0,"It is a comfortable shoe, but I had to add an arch support. It isn't true to size, either, I had to return and get 1/2 size smaller than I normally wear. I like the shoe, though, very comfortable and they come in the wide sizes I need."
131809,2,"The boot is great but $21.00 for shipping (YES, within the U.S., not even international!) GIVE ME A BREAK! Buy these from Overstock...much cheaper!"
287786,1,"When someone says Tracy Mcgrady, what do you think about? His signature T-MAC shoes (the originals), The T-MAC 2's? I think about my T-MAC 3's. I think that they look great, feel extremely confertable, and are great for playing basketball. The shiny exterior in not really made of real leather (synthetic leather)but it still breathes well, and the stripes add to the signature T-MAC shoes. the insides fell like wearing a pillow on your feet, but for the first few days it hurts really bad until you stretch the sole to fit your foot, and the back has a strecthy piece to fit your foot perfectly. another downside is that if you get them wet, they stay wet for a while. The bottoms herringbone design is specially formed to grip the floor with it's best ability. The reason i give it a four is because they stay wet for a while, hurt your feet for the first few days (but then there REALLY COMFORTABLE) and after walk in them for a little the shell exterior bends to a funky design fitting your foot. I have to recommend these shoes to any basketball players though."
356885,1,"I love the sneakers. They are better quality than the ones at Payless, and a good price too."
135024,1,"It's a classy shoe that fits well and rides well too. I bought a pair four years ago and they are still holding up - although they're beat up, they've become my factory loafers - I can wear them anywhere. Remember, you may be paying twice as much as normal tassel loafers, but they are definitely twice the shoe. It's so comfortable."
314020,1,I needed a tough yet casual looking work boot that's lightweight. These boots are so versatile ... they can get away with a business casual look ... a sporty look ... and are perfect with denims. They hug your feet snugly and have the support you need. I love them so much that I don't mind owning one in every color available!
81276,1,Greatest Most durable boots I've ever purchased. I'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid. All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost. I'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting.
349974,1,These shoes are cute and great for standing at my pharmacy job. Thank you
124720,1,Great shoes I want to buy more. Durable (so far) stylish and very comfortable. I recommend them for daily wear or walkers
162385,1,"This is standard issue footwear for anyone who wants the ""look"" of indie rock (the others are t-shirts that look to be from a redneck bar circa 1978 but really came from a suburban Old Navy circa 2010 and those ""washed-out"" blue jeans that were purchased at the same Old Navy). The shoes are grossly unfit for any athletic activity (I don't know how the heck I survived playing street hockey in these things as a teenager), provide no protection against the cold or stepping on sharp objects, begin to smell horribly after 9+ months of use and have a tendency to have the sole tear away from the rest of the shoe after those 9 months (if the smell hasn't destroyed them yet). But their coolness factor will never, ever be replicated by any footwear, past, present or future (the Roman sandal gave them a run for their money in the 1980s by the garage punk band Thee Mighty Caesars, but that's another story). Everyone should own a pair of these shoes at least once in their lifetimes."
78645,1,"Purchased for my daughter. She loves the sneaker, runs slightly larger than normal shoe size. I would order 1/2 size smaller."
275675,1,"Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
374622,1,"Quality of shoes is very good. They are also easy to put on and look good on our daughter. They are a bit rigid when she crawls, even though these are stage 2 shoes. But ideal for cruising around."
13235,1,Very comfortable and cute shoe. I wear a 9 AA and rarely find great colored shoes in my size. I bought these in aqua and am very happy with the fit and the look.
372729,1,"Bought the book as a gift and the receiver loved it. The item came quickly and as described, great deal."
144010,1,"My wife loves these boots! She wanted them for Christmas, and was so happy to receive them from Santa. Super warm an comfortable, and she won't take them off."
145258,1,"I normally wear a 10.5 or 11, but based on reviews, bought these a little smaller in size 10. They are snug, but feel great, especially on bare feet. I do a lot of ballroom dancing and often have sore feet. After long dance practice sessions, these boots cradle my sore soles in luxuriously soft sheepskin. Sometimes, I even wear them in the house like slippers because they are so comfortable. You can look at the knock offs and imitations, but real Uggs are worth every penny. My recommendation is not to compromise."
272619,1,Love these flip flops! The slight arch makes them extemely comfortable. I have the solid black as well and plan on ordering other colors.
69101,1,"These are excellent shoes, well made, true to size, and sexy. However, I ordered a pair in Ivory and when I opened the box, the color was not Ivory. It looked more like pale pinkish-beige. Had they been ivory or even champagne I would have kept them but, it wasn't close enough."
292972,1,DO NOT BUY THESE IN YOUR NORMAL DR. MARTEN SIZE!!!! There is nothing wrong with these boots except they run small. Buy a size larger and you'll be happy. If I hadn't had to send them back and get a larger size I'd give them 5 stars.
149182,1,"They come in my size! (14) They have a good fit, they are more breathable than other rubber boots... what's not to like?On the inside these boots have some form of a mesh that adds in ventilation. That helps to carry the moisture away from your feet. I also recommend wearing wool socks with these, especially in cold weather."
351234,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
118257,1,My 4yr old loves these and the are a great fit! She wears a size 11 so that's what we ordered and they are perfect!
182273,1,"these are my fave flip-flops...or thongs...whatever you call them...they are flattering on the feet, with their skinny straps...and the cushion is the perfect depth...these came out right after platform thongs--what a relief!i have three pairs of the taupe...they are perfect to dress down something neutral without looking sloppy..."
204915,1,"I read reviews for several shoe/boot dryers. I picked this particular one because of the reviewer that said that SOME SHOE DRYERS ( with fans ) made the room smell bad & are noisy.That, and I like the fact that there are no moving parts to break down.I tend to get sidetracked picking up the newspaper from the driveway in the morning & stop along the way to do a little gardening.By the time I finish watering, weeding,& digging my slippers are soaked. They smell ""sheepy"" & take forever to dry out.Since buying the Dry Guy I have no more soggy slippers.I keep the Dry Guy in my bedroom closet (I have an outlet in there) withtwo pair of uggs so I have warm & toasty dry slippers at all times. I've kept the Dry Guy heating for long periods of time and it does not over-heat. I LOVE,LOVE, LOVE IT!!!! It is perfect.HIGHLY RECOMMENED!"
383028,0,"I love these shoes, but the insole was too small for me. Very uncomfortable so I bought the waterproof Birkenstock clogs with no insole. Amazon has a great exchange policy on shoes."
320311,0,"These slippers were ok, but definitely run wide. In street shoes I wear a 10 or 10.5 and I often size up to an 11 in loafers or ballet flats to accomodate my slightly wide feet. I ordered a 10W since these slippers are not offered in an 11, and they were loose even with the drawstring completely tightened. I ended up exchanging for a pair of Blochs, which come in longer lengths."
340691,1,"I had my first pair of Converse All-stars in high school in the early 1960's. That was before they were known as ""Chucks."" They were, and still are, the best basketball sneakers around. They're good for everyday workouts and just hanging around the house. Comfortable, inexpensive and they last just about forever."
340980,1,"My husband loves this type of slipper for the winter, and had his last pair for a few years. The last pair were in need of serious replacement. These were at an affordable price, compared to several others in similar style. The product is quality, the price fair and the service great."
317799,1,"the first pair of sandals arrived quickly, but they were too big, they seem to run bigger/larger than other shoes. Re-order a smaller size and my loves them."
112276,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
109071,1,"I buy a new pair of these boots every six months and keep two pairs on constant rotation - but not as boots. On half of my pairs I cut the leg sleeve off right around the shoe edges and wear them as shoes. When I wear them as boots I pull them up to the knee then pull the long sleeve part down to the ankle and roll it up so they are like knee high boots with thick cuffs. I get compliments on them every time I wear them - regardless of which method I use when I wear them.I wouldn't recommend them for someone who isn't comfortable in really high heels but if you are used to 4""+ heels these are a great option, they're actually quite comfortable and I say that having worn them for up to 18 hours in a day."
216744,1,"Exactly as was expected, good very durable shoes. Very clean and wearable. Would definitely purchase again, nice to wear out."
333916,0,"I can understand why this shoe receives so many positive reviews. The leather is highly breathable, and the rubber sole is very soft which make you feel like walking on thick carpet.However, the insole is very slippery (I don't know if this is intentional!), so unless the size is small enough and fits your foot completely, your foot will move around as you walk, causing injury to toe skin if walked long enough. I wear shoes with size US size 10 very comfortably, but even if I wear size 9 of this one I still hurt my toe skin."
212000,1,"Comfortable, durable, sleek and reliable -- and true to size! I have been wearing these shoes for years. Many thanks K Swiss!"
57530,1,"These sneakers are great. Super comfortable and fit really well, esp. considering they were bought online...Keds are well made I think, and they were delivered to my door in a short time.. a little pricey, but well worth it"
131635,1,I would definitely use this seller again. They were very helpful and accomodating.
78486,1,"If you didn't already know, make sure you order 1/2 a size smaller then you normally would when ordering Converse.Love these shoes."
197374,1,I find it hard to get chuck taylors in size 12 in stores around my area. It was nice to see they had them here on amazon in a mulitple of styles at great prices. The shipping was faster than I could of imagined and I plan to order future products from this provider.
201844,1,These are really nice shoes that have a quality look and feel to them.Nothing is better than a pair of nice fitting shoes that are stylish as well.
213980,1,"They are durable, comfortable and cozy. I love this style of boot and have had terrible luck in the past with similar boots falling apart and my feet getting cold or wet. These are great, especially because of the affordable price. Love my boots."
243555,0,The sizing is way off! My daughter is a 4. Ordered the 5 - too tight. Exchanged for the 6 - too loose but keeping. Would prefer to buy in a store but couldn't find.
301656,1,"Love Love Love these shoes, they are the most comfortable shoes in the world and I mean that. I am so happy with these shoes I will most certainly buy more pairs, just as some others have voiced. You can wear these shoes all day and your feet will be comfortable all day and night, they are fully padded inside and the vamps are higher also which gives you a lift especially if you are short like I am. They feature a good quality canvas upper and quality stitching all around. I am currently wearing them just around my home as house shoes, sometimes I even forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable that I accidently wear them outside, that's how comfortable Grasshoppers are. In my opinion these shoes should be renouned for comfort. Believe I will continue to purchase these shoes as long as they make them. I recommend these shoes to everyone who is seeking a quality made most comfortable shoe. And a big plus they even supply you with a shipping label with your order, that's the sign of a confident manufacturer. Added to my review this is a update to my last review, these Grasshopper Jensens slip on shoes is that they did not last as long as I thought or expected to last it is now a year later and their are signs of wear these shoes were only worn inside my home and never worn outside my home, this latest update will not deter me from purchasing these most comfortable shoes however it will be a disappointment as far as how long they last, this is the only disappointment I have with this brand."
17007,1,"My husband started playing soccer on Saturdays with some friends and he didn't have any soccer cleats so he used his old football cleats for months. I decided to look into soccer cleats and found these Adidas Copa Mundial's. They were at a decent price, carried half sizes and had a few good reviews. I took a chance; and when my husband tried them on, he absolutely loved them. And, of course, they were so much lighter than his football cleats. They fit him perfectly, they look great on him, and he says that they feel great.Thank you!"
205235,1,"I really like these sneakers; I've had them for several months now.I will be getting a second pair (different color trim) to get me through the summer. I ordered a ""wide"" size which always fits me well... but I have to say, even in the wide size the elastic ""laces"" were very, very tight.Solution? I snipped away the elastic on either side of the ""Skechers"" medallion in the center (top) of the tongue. No one notices and the extra inch of give is Perfect! This won't stop me from getting that second pair!"
75074,1,"I love these! Softspots knows how to make them comfortable right away. Yes, they come a little snug, but it gives them the ability to shape to your feet. Very attractive! Highly recommend!"
189133,1,"The ONLY reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 was that it's slightly uncomfortable, BUT they are the cutest summer shoes in my closet! I've had more compliments on these shoes than any I own!"
120297,1,I love these sandals! Very comfortable and look cute on my feet. I am buying a pair for my 13 year old dtr.
371643,1,"I loved these shoes...they were so comfortable...and I wore them out...wish I had them in different colors, but I only found them in black..."
50611,1,"Sturdy enough to support your ankles, a nice height and actually easier to walk in than ones with shorter heels. I love these shoes especially because they don't wear out easily. The only downside is that when you unzip them to take them off, the laces come undone because there are hooks that the laces loop around instead of holes they thread through."
163469,1,"Quality, stylish, comfortable and all around fabulous! (Wife's words...) Will be buying in all colors! So impressed, looks great, don't hesitate to buy. =)"
362235,1,"These are nice boots, they look really good, and are my husband's favorite brand, these are not his favorite one's of this brand, these make a weird sound when he walks but they are not broke in yet, but these was delivered on time and are a quality boot that looks excellent, i love the color of them, nice brown color. Very happy with purchase"
17096,1,"i've never been able to get used to playing basketball in a high-top for some reason. thankfully (knock on wood) i've never had ankle problems, probably because i play more of a guard position. i would recommend this shoe for those looking for good arch support. it isn't too heavy of a shoe and the sole works with your movements. I'd recommend this shoe for a primarily perimeter player."
116605,1,Our daughter is a dancer and its cheaper and easier to order her items online. These shipped fast and are holding up great!
162557,2,"I was not pleased with the product I received. Before I purchased the product I would have liked to have known that the colour black is not what you think! I still think I was sent the wrong colour shoes (they look like they're navy blue not black).When I emailed the company about this they ignored me and did not offer for me to send them back or anything, so I was not happy with them at all.I will not be purchasing from them again!"
32764,1,"My 5-year-old granddaughter absolutely loves these boots, and she looks so cute in them. She wears them all day every day and has even voluntarily worn skirts so the world can see her boots. She hates skirts."
224874,1,"The shoes looks good and are well made, I know how young people like to stay in style and they arrived well in the time frame given."
281763,1,These are great shoes. They are very comfortable and easy to put on. Fast delivery too.
127685,1,I am size 7 and the size 7 I bought fits like a glove. The shoes arrived on time and feel very comfortable. I walk a lot on the wet pavement and so stability is important to me. These shoes have good grip.I also love the look. I received many compliments today.
157184,1,This is the third pair of this model I've owned and I have been thrilled with every single one. Great running shoe or just an everyday shoe.
317807,1,"I bought these for my son for our Florida trip. Excellent shipping, wonderful quality that I've come to expect from Crocs. Sizes seem to tend a little bit larger than normal, but that's due to the shoe design"
22163,1,This pair of shoes is very comfortable and met my expectations. The photos however does not show exactly how the shoe looks and feel.
3600,0,"First off, I'm only giving this product three stars because of the tongue issue. In respect to every other characteristic the boots seem fine and a well made product for the price. However, my issue involves Hi-Tec marketing these boots as having a fully-gusseted tongue. They are not, the gusset only travels half the height of the boot so that's not a full gusset, it's a half. Error to Hi Tec for marekting them as such (it's not Amazon's fault, Hi Tec even markets the full gusset on their web site and Amazon mirrors these details here). If I would have known this I wouldn't have purchased, now I'll have to send them back.Update: Even though I was disappointed because of the gusseted tongue issue I was prepared to keep these boots (after all, you generally have to pay quite a bit more for boots with a full-gusset) until I discovered a fatal flaw--poor stitching on the upper inside of the right boot. This stitching was so rough that I could feel it rub against the top of my foot after nearly every step, even through thick hiking socks. It wasn't so much of an issue after a 5-10 minute trial walks but after a couple hours of walking I had a nice patch of sore skin that hurt more with every step. I returned these boots and bought a pair of much more expensive Columbia Daska Pass hikers. I'm very pleased with the new Columbias. No bias towards Hi-Tec--the gusseted thing could be a simple mistake of the marketing department and the stitching issue was likely just a random defect. I will say , however, that in the future I will only be purchasing hikers in the in the class of the Daska Pass boots as the comfort, ergonomics and durability (at least in the soles, we'll see how the uppers hold up) are far superior."
322335,1,"They look nice and are as comfortable as tennis shoes. Nothing fancy, but a nice casual shoe that goes well with jeans and khakis."
184433,1,"GREAT BOOTS!!! I've owned many ""hunting"" boots over the past 20 yrs. and these are shaping up to be the very best. I love the height on these boots as they add extra protection from the elements. Also, great stability around the ankle and heel for all day support and comfort. Last, good traction for traversing uneven terrain. Plus, Danner offers recrafting on these boots. I've owned several Danner boots and.have taken advantage of the recrafting for prolonged yrs. of service. Take it from me, these boots are well worth the money and Amazon offers the very best price around. If I could make one improvement, I would have Danner offer these exact boots in a non-insulated version. Enjoy!!!"
335080,1,"Call me stupid, because I tried them on in purple when I was in Boston last month, but didn't buy them... And now they're nowhere to be found in a size 9.5 or 10 anymore, I'm SO sad!"
149692,1,"these are the best sneakers, but so hard to find in the stores...both my husband and I have had these over the years and feel the most comfortable in them compared to other brands. When my hubbys' birthday was rolling around he said that was all he needed ,so instead of traipsing all over I just checked Amazon and there they were..I ordered two pairs .. and they arrived in a timely fashion and of course fit well..These also wash great! ,Just air dry and they are ready to go.."
247037,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
189987,1,"I already own a pair of these shooes and like them, so I bought an extra pair and I'm really happy and they arrived fast;)."
297872,1,"Estoy encantada con esas sandalias, preciosas, muy comodas. He tenido otras sandalias de esta marca y me han resultado excelentes. Si lo recomendaria."
218584,1,"Great with jeans, great for fun and sport but mostly a universal staple in ones wardrobe man or woman! I would order them again and in every color of the rainbow. I am not thinking of the high tops and the other higher tie up ones."
98728,1,I LOVE these slippers and feel they are worth every penny they cost. So warm and comfortable. I can't wait to slip my feet in them when I get home at night. Ahhhhhhhh.
268138,1,"After trying on a friend's new Dansko Professional clogs, I knew that they were just what I needed. I remembered that nurses seemed to wear them (in white) and as a teacher, I too was on my feet a good portion of the day. I checked prices locally and on the web, and Amazon beat everyone. My Dankso's are heavy and very substantial, and the arch support is more than adequate. The sizing is a bit tricky because they are European. I erred to the larger because I was right in the middle in US size, and they are perfect even with tights or thin knee socks. They have some really fashion-forward styles, but I went with basic black leather for a starter pair."
340065,1,You've seen these shoes everywhere...right? Well theres a reason for it! They are SO comfortable and virtually go with ANY outfit! I love them and wear them everyday! :) BUY THESE SHOES and you won't regret it (unless YOU order the wrong size!)
174890,1,"I have always liked Naturalizer shoes and had some similar to the Scout in the past. I like the fact that I can adjust their tightness by moving the tab at the closing. My only difficulty is that, as yet, they are a bit stiff. However, I expect them to become more supple after wearing them for some time.Nancy Holt"
86647,1,"the shoes were perfect and came right on time. however, the very first time i wore them, they got scuffed by a tricky curb. i wish you could have installed some kind of invisable force field around them so that they would stay so white. you really need to work on that."
274595,1,"The Hi-Tec Men's Altitude waterproof hiker has out performed more expense boots I have owned. With the December snow storm in the east,it was a great test. I gave my old Hi-Tec hikers to my son because he liked them so much. That's why I purchase another pair."
248560,1,"These are perfectly comfortable, I have had these boots before, so I knew I could not go wrong and the price was within my budget. I wear a ladies 5.5-6 and the 4.5 big kids fit great!"
176785,1,"I purchased a pair of 6&quot; normal toe grizzlies back in Jan of 1998. Since then, I have replaced the insoles about every 6 months. I used to spend 50-55 hours a week on concrete working with pallets, iron pipe, concretemix, anything else you could beat on in a warehouse. Since then I'm only pushing 40 hours but it's the same stuff. These boots have always been comfortable. Friday, I tore the left boot really bad in a workplace incident. I'm getting another pair tomorrow, no other boot will do. Period. Just talked to the same guy that sold me the boots six years ago. G&amp;L Clothing knows their stuff!"
105387,1,Looked everywhere for a decent boot that did not cost a fortune.This boot has the style and comfort....THANK YOU
16269,1,"Clarks is the only shoe I buy. I'm on my feet 8 to 10 hours a day and they are the most comfortable shoe. Even new, I don't have to take another pair to work in case these will hurt my feet. The price was also great."
253296,0,"These boots look great with jeans or khakis, and I've gotten a lot of compliments on them. My only issue is with the sole wearing very quickly. I've had them for about a month and the sole is already showing significant wear on the heel. I tend to walk over 3 miles a day at work on tile floors, and I was surprised at how quickly the crepe sole was wearing out. However, they look great and are very comfortable after breaking them in. I'd only recommend these boots for lazy days when you're not moving around a lot since I figured the sole would only last another 4 months at work."
285966,1,Bought these for my daughter this past Christmas. She loves them and wears them almost every day.
270351,1,"These Rockport shoes have greatly helped my sore, sore feet. Since being in the military I have had problems with my feet. These are the first shoes to give me a measure of relief!"
112151,1,"Amazingly comfortable!! I teach Medical Assisting clinical classes, so I'm on my feet a lot, they are so comfortable that my back no longer hurts after a long day. Would recommend these to everyone!! Super light weight and durable."
251755,1,"The county fair was coming into town so I wanted a pair of boots to wear during the week. My cowgirl friend had told me Ariat boots were her favorite, so that is what i searched and these were the cheapest ones I could find. I ordered them in an 8 1/2 which is what I wear in a tennis shoe. I ordered 2 day shipping and they came in 2 days! It was great shipping. When I tried them on, they were a little big, but I went and bought a pair of thick knee-high socks and wore them for a couple days and they fit great. I had to break them in like every pair of shoe, but once I got those socks they fit perfect and I feel that if I would have gotten an 8 size, they would have been too small. Great buy!! Don't hesitate:-)"
200480,1,This shoe appeared damaged (or worn) so we had to return it. Took a while to get return handled from marketplace supplier. Not a fan of sperry though - too boxy.
354593,1,"I drive a truck and need a sturdy boot that will up hold well. So far the boot has been waterproof, comfortable and warm on chilly days. It only took a day or two to feel &#34;broken in&#34; and not so stiff and tight."
190761,1,They were wider than I had expected. Usually children's sizes run more narrow and these ran much wider. I needed to wear two socks and they were hard to break in.
185960,1,"Actually, in error, I ordered a size too small and could not wear them. Did try exchanging them for my size but they did not have the shoes available in that. So actually I never got to enjoy them."
176221,1,"MRS BOWLES WAS ""VERY PLEASED "" WITH THE PRODUCT, THE SPEED OF DEV., AND THE ACCURACY OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS.WE FELT LIKE WE ""WERE FAVORITE CUSTOMERS""...."
156786,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
215850,2,"I also purchased a pair thinking they were the original sandals that I had worn and loved for so many years. Not only is the wood not well shaped anymore but the leather upper on any of the design sandals is thin fabric and thus flimsy. The best part of the original sandals was the great toe grip. That is what made this sandal famous and gave us all such wonderful calves! The new ones are almost flat. I also sent mine back but beware... check this before you buy. I had to pay a restocking fee to send them back! So you pay shipping, then hate them and send them back paying more shipping AND a restocking fee. Might as well have kept them. I am very disappointed and wrote to Dr Scholls to let them know."
299037,1,"Love the look, love the quality. The &#34;fit&#34; not so much. They are constructed out of really stiff leather. At least for me they really chaffed my ankles, though they are beginning to break in now, the process has been pretty uncomfortable for a while. It has taken about 5 wearings to get to this point and before being &#34;comfortable&#34; will probably take another 4 or 5. If not for this they would be perfect."
172656,1,THESE REVIEWS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE PRODUCT - NOT THE SELLER! SO DISREGARD THE PREVIOUS 2 REVIEWS! ALL PROPET SHOES ARE FABULOUS! QUALITY & COMFORT! AND NO- I'M NOT AFFILIATED WITH PROPET IN ANY WAY! JUST AN EXTREMELY SATISFIED CUSTOMER OF ALL PROPET SHOES FOR 8 YEARS NOW :)
66132,1,God quality which is the case always with Clarks products. Very comfortable
65550,1,"i received these shoes and they are very soft and confortable, sincerly it was a good choice. I recomended them."
173042,1,"The shoes have a really flexible sole, and are great for new walkers. However, the leather is very soft and becomes scuffed easily. After wearing most days for ~ 6 weeks, the leather on the toes was endanger of ripping off the sole. However, I'll probably buy another pair, because I'm very happy with how they fit."
71175,1,"I love this sneaker. It's very comfortable and very cool looking, I love all the colors they come in too."
245675,1,AFTER A LITTLE BREAKING IN I AM COMPETLY SATIFIED...MY LAST PAIR OF SKETCHERS LASTED 3 YRS
23662,1,"I concur with all of the reviews regarding this wonderful flip flop. I have worn this flip flop every day for 1 1/2 weeks. I wear a 9 1/2 inch shoe and I purchased a 10 M flip flop. This size is just right for my foot. My foot is an average width (D), and the flip flop just fits me. If you have a wide foot I would not recommend this sandal. After the initial break in period (about four days) this flip flop is very comfortable. I mainly wear this flip flop indoors as a bedroom slipper. However I also wore it outdoors on a non-rainy day. Since the straps are made of leather, I would not recommend this flip flop if there is any chance of rain."
364337,2,We ordered the Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops with the white soles and laces. What we received was the all black shoes. That's not the picture that went with the order we placed.
327295,1,"What can I say other than they shipped fast, seller gave me some cash back, as they had these listed on their site cheaper, an they arrived exactly as described!!Everyone I know, an everywhere I go I get comments on these, an I love them!!"
175462,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
212741,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
258201,1,This is such a great producto from adidas. Excellent for wrestling of going to the gym. It is very comfortable and fits very well.
6360,1,"The boots have exceeded by expectations. Double-H has been my favorite brand since I discovered them in a boot store in Nashville. I'm wearing them to work with slacks, polo, and dress coat. The smooth finish allows you to dress formal (suit) and also looks good with jeans. Being new, the lower section (foot covering) has a glossy finish that does not match the shaft. When worn for a while, the boots look somewhat uniform in color and texture. The lower portion still shines more than the shaft. Unlike other boots, these have a sole with traction control. I recommended going to the Double-H website and reviewing the product. While wearing these boots six days a week (14 hr days), I have not noticed any foot, leg, or back pain. These boots weigh less than other Double-H boots I own. The ""break-in"" period was short. I recommended conventional black shoe polish. In 2011, I will order a second pair. It would be ideal if Double-H offered a natural leather option (tan) in this same boot. I hope this helps............."
86389,1,This is my second pair of these shoes. They are comfortable with or without socks. For the price it is a good shoe. Excellent for casual wear or as a dress shoe.
379415,1,"I love these shoes....my friend had to order them on Amazon immediately after she saw them....great height without compromising comfort. This is my 6th pair of Cordani shoes and plan on adding to the list! Very well made, comfortable, pretty comparable to Robert Clergerie shoes but cost about 50% less. Thanks Amazon for having them!!! They are not easy to find in stores."
165514,1,"This is a great shoe for me. It is light weight yet supportive. It looks dressier than I expected, which I am very pleased about."
345885,1,my daughter is happy with the purchase. i had order in dec but received wrong size due men size instead of women size. it was my fault . the only complain it was that it took a long time from the time i sent it to get it replaced with correct size. that was my only complain it took a month to get it right. but is a cool sneaker and i did received correct one and my child is happy. yes i would recommend just when ordering make sure you click on the gender size (lol) if not you automactic received in male size.
14166,1,"For the price, it's hard to beat the shoe. A great one for beginners. However, don't expect to get too technical with them. They seemed to fit true to size for me (12/13 in most brands to a 13 in this shoe), and about as comfortable as climbing shoes can be."
98867,1,Great shoe. Would be nice if it had a padded tongue. Some difficulty untieing because top string buckles that are difficult to work with.
315149,1,"I looked for a good two months for boots then I came across these. The tread is great and they are super warm. The only thing I can suggest is to make sure you seal them with something if you are using these in deep snow. After that, they are great. Great look and very comfortable. I even end up wearing them all day sometimes."
52933,1,"I bought these for my cousin's wedding and they looked perfect with my outfit. A great strappy sandle! They were slightly more comfortable than the standard 'special shoe' in that my feet were not numb or bleeding at the end of the evening. I was a bit shocked at the lack of quality though. The material is of nice quality and I think I will have them forever but the accuracy of the workmanship leaves a bit to be desired. However, I am quite sure that no one will get close enough to my shoes to notice that edges aren't properly alighted!At less than $25, I would highly recommend them."
367230,0,"While it works great for gloves, heavy work boots that are soakedtake a few (8) cycles to dry completely. To be fair the boots were saturated. The size is perfect and stores easily. It's very easy to use without reading the instructions (for Men). Still a good value for the money."
205083,0,"these spikes are very confortable and light, and if you do care about looks, they are only nice pair I have seen on a track. However, it is difficult to tighten them because they only have 4 lace holes on each side, and the tongue is very loose, hence they are not very stable. it feels all right running with them in a straight line, but when it comes to curves, the foot tends to slide sideways inside the shoe, which is quite annoying. The air cushion in the heel doesnt feel really good to me. All this is not good news for a shoe designed for long sprints (I wouldnt recommend them for shorts sprints at all)."
139289,1,What an awesome shoes!!! I have been buying the same model of running shoes for three yrs.Highy recommanded
148805,1,"Bought these for myself and love them, so comfortable and the color is so nice, Wore them walking around Disney, the sole is thick the size was just right, came with on problems. Just a nice pair of monccasins."
298032,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes I own. I have flat feet so it's hard to find good shoes. I usually buy size 13 but read that these were plenty wide and long enough so I bought these in size 12 (my measured &#34;true&#34; size) and I'm glad I did. Plenty of room for my toes, both in length and width. A winner!"
337010,1,"I have been a fan of Converse since the day I saw Will Smith unpack a brand new pair in the movie iRobot. I wanted one for myself, where else amazon is the best place to buy. The Product price is very affordable except the shipping and handling costs. They are a bit high to Sri Lanka. Would be great if they are low too."
188574,1,I like this shoes. It is useful and good looking. I advise it. Leg of this boot is the best I have ever seen.
217416,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
82894,1,"My wife's last pair like this lasted 12 years and finally got a hole in the sole. So she wanted to replace them. The ""purple"" color is actually a little more fusia/pink but she still loves them!"
79777,0,I ordered these flip flops after hearing rave reviews about the Reef brand. I was pretty disapointed in the comfort of them. They are pretty narrow and the strap part cuts into my foot on the sides. I have looked at other Reef flip flops in stores and they seem to be thicker giving more padding. I have been wearing Nike comfort thongs for so many years it is hard to find a comfortable flip flop these days. Overall nicely made shoes for the price.

141421,1,My fifth pair same quality as always. Used to buy for hipness. Now Podiatrist says never go barefoot. My new house slippers.
17375,0,"I purchased my first pair of these colorful classic sneakers several years ago, at a local 'brand name' discount store. To be honest, they initially caught my eye because of their vibrant color. Once I tried them on, they felt so wonderful, that I knew from that very moment, that I would wear them until they literally fell off my feet. They had such fantastic cushioning, with arch support, a cut above the highest standard. These are the only shoes I have ever owned that did NOT require additional supportive inserts.The sad day came, when I had to delegate my foot savers to the trash. I wasn't too upset, because I figured they would never discontinue such a wonderful product. I was wrong. No one seemed to carry them. Disgruntled in my search, I gave up looking the last couple of years, only to stumble on them by complete accident, on Amazon. When I found them again, I was ecstatic. Not only were they old favorites, but I work as an RN, and we have recently been required to wear only navy blue scrubs. A perfect match!The shoes arrived and I was not disappointed in their appearance. They are still striking and fun to look at. But, as other reviewers have noted, the foot-bed is not the same. They definitely do not have the same degree of cushioning, and the arch support is minimal, at best. So, I did have to resort to orthotic inserts, this time, before I could even wear them. But, after doing so, they were brought up to almost the same degree of comfort as my first pair. But, not quite!I normally wear an 8 1/2 but sized up to a 9 because some reviewers felt this new version runs a little small. I didn't find this to be true. Even with an additional insert, this shoe is a little looser than I like, requiring some pretty tight lacing, or a thicker sock. I think most would do well to just order their regular size.I'm disappointed that they have, in my opinion, cheapened this wonderful shoe. But, that does seem to be the sign of the times, doesn't it."
82871,1,"Lightweight, arch-supportive, perfect! Get the ones with dark foot-beds, otherwise dirt shows quickly! I wear these all summer, have gone through a number of pairs now (they'll eventually wear thin in spots, but also my dog chewed up a few!)."
93492,1,"Very comfortable but almost too wide for my wider foot. If shells or rocks get inside, they can be a little hard to remove. Overall a good shoe."
107682,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
195280,1,Great product look and feel fantastic pricing was fair and product arrived in three days. You can't beat the overall experience.
229239,1,"The shoes looks like in the picture, except for the rubber sole. It looks a little bit ""yellower"" than expected"
235184,1,I have had several pairs of this shoe. Looks good and feels great plus I wear a 101/2 which is hard to find. Ido not know why manufacturers of shoes think that after 10 they only make whole sizes. Will probably buy other colors of this shoe.
74513,1,My sons both love their crocs. When I got their new pairs in the mail this week they both wanted to wear them to bed!
278873,1,"These shoes are very soft, flexible and quite comfortable. They seem to run a little large but thicker socks fix that. Although these are ECCOs, they don't seem as well-made or comfortable as some ECCOs I bought 3-4 years ago."
259751,1,"Product was just as advertised. Only concern was that I did not receive a tracking number so I had no idea when exactly it would arrive. Other than that, great seller =)"
358831,1,"Since hitting middle age, my feet have given me trouble...have been to podiatrists, etc. I tried Berkenstocks and they were okay, but the Crocs have been my life saver. Maybe not gorgeous to look at, but I can walk and walk and WALK in them and not have any problems. I've tried a lot of other highly recommended shoes, but these are by far the best. I love the pink, navy, and khaki...and I do find the Cayman's/Classics to be the best of all styles for comfort."
339310,1,"Exactly as advertised the famous Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneaker is a great buy! Looks great, fits great and is super comfortable. I highly recommend it!"
235362,0,"They are rather tight for a medium width, and, although they are described as having a 1-1/2 inch heel, I measured the heel at 1/2"", the same as the Liberty Flat, which sells for $20 less. The low heel makes them less dressy than what I thought I was getting."
365476,1,I bought these for my nephew's birthday and they were exactly what he wanted. They arrived in the right amount of time and in perfect condition. Would recommend this seller to anyone.
329140,1,"this is truly the best shoe i've ever bought, and trust me, i've had em all, nike, brooks, nb etc etc. THIS IS NOT JUST FOR TRAIL RUNNING. i use mine on trails and on the street and the shoe does great on both. i got these after having these recommended to me by a guy at galyans after i explained that my knees sometimes played up after a lacrosse injury. these shoes just make it a pleasure to run. really chushiony, totally eliminated my knee pains, great grip when i do go on the trails! would totally recommend these to anyone. my friend borrowed them yesterday and was so impressed that she's going to get herself a pair today!"
262046,1,"speedy shipping, package arrived before estimated time of delivery.gladly do business with seller again any day of the week."
271478,1,"These are great boots----they look good and are built to last. The scratches and scuffs look a little contrived, but I still like them. The leather is soft but not thin or cheap. The sole has Goodyear welt construction and is double-stitched.Two things to be aware of: on me, they run about a half size bigger than I expected. And the sole is fairly stiff and slick at first, so there is a break-in period."
304184,1,"While I'm not a runner, I bought these on advice from others that have to walk on concrete as part of their job. The anti roll and cushion soles are the best support I've had for my feet in a long time. I ended up buying a second pair, one set for work, and the other for home and biking.You can't go wrong with this shoe, not to mention you can get them in 4E widths!maloy"
342636,0,"I don't think that these shoes are original converse ,but in any case the quality is acceptable and they are true to size.It seems that one can not get original stuff these days."
61488,1,If you want some comfortable boots these are the ones . My 5th consecutive pair .
281355,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
381824,0,"not bad, looks a little plain though."
162716,1,"I loved the style, height and comfort of this boot; however, it didn't fit. The shaft of the boot is just too wide -- so it flopped around on my calf. Unfortunately I had to return these boots -- but found another (cheaper) pair by Anne Klein that worked out. If you have wider calfs then these will definitely work for you."
14668,0,I like this shoe its comfortable and looks nice. The only thing that I've been disappointed about so far is that after I washed shoes on gentle cycle some of the pieces started to separate from the shoe.
76356,0,The other reviews said they run true to street shoe size. I disagree. They are in the general size are of street shoe sizing but run VERY narrow. If your feet are even a little bit wide these shoes are going to be a stretch for you to fit into.
160965,1,"awesome love them as always!! Just a reminder...get converse two sizes smaller than you usually would:) ex if your size 9, get size 7"
318147,1,"I was very pleased with the shoes. They are very comfortable. The fit was great (something you always worry about when ordering). The color was what I expected.Look great with slacks and shorts. I wear them to work and also wore them to the County fair, walking over 4hrs. Love the shoes."
367605,0,They are a basic tan mocassin. I bought them to wear while walking the dog. They are okay for that.
116018,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. All of us girls have worn them for years, and they are so comfortable. The service was great, and delivered on time, the prices cannot be beat."
129950,0,"After only a few months of very light use, the soles have begun to separate at the heel from the rest of the shoe. It's not bad, but you feel absolutely any moisture at all immediately."
122942,1,Great company. Sent products with expedited delivery. Had to return item and company paid for return mail. Unexpected great customer service!
179237,1,arrived in a timely matter and in great conditionpurchased it for a great price in comparison to other sellers
215504,1,"I have purchased Ryka shoes for about 20 years. These are the only shoes I will buy. They are always a perfect fit and are made for only women. Unlike other top name brands that are made for men and then sized to fit women. In all the years I have bought Ryka I have never had one problem. They always fit perfect. Never any blisters or sore feet trying to break them in. Once you go Ryka you will never go back to expensive, poor fitting shoes."
271337,1,"This is my second pair, in as many years. Comfortable, nice hieght and affordable."
360797,1,"I love, love, love these shoes!! I bought them for a part I had in a musical. They were super comfortable to wear throughout the entire performance. I had to change costumes VERY quickly at one point and these shoes were easy to keep on the loosest strap setting and just slip on. I wore them for 6 performances & 2 rehearsals and they still look only slightly used. These shoes will last a LONG time."
347155,1,"This is my first pair of Chucks, and I have to say that I am absolutely in love with them. A good looking, comfortable, light shoe that goes with everything - what more could you want?"
180236,0,"Timeless look, whether you're a prep or a punk, anyone can pull off wearing a pair of chucks. Not good for athletic performance, it shocks me to realize they were created for basketball use. Ouch! Also, due to their lack of traction and feeble soles, it's easy to burn through a pair in a matter of months if they're your regular shoe. That makes them not worth the $40 price tag Converse is offering them for. If they were $20-25, maybe. I recommend this shoe for people more concerned with style than comfort."
149057,1,"Bought my first pair a couple of years ago. Just bought two more pairs to take on a cruise. They are attractive have good support and are comfortable to walk in. the two velcro front straps were a great adjustment idea. My old ones still have a lot of wear left. Will use for yard work, etc."
9850,1,"I originally ordered a different pair of Rockport's that are so comfortable it should be illegal! These are not the same....they run narrow and do not have the interior support of the other. But just because I had a certain idea in mind doesn't mean they aren't beautiful, quality made shoes. So I gave them a 4."
139804,0,"I love the look, but the leather straps rub against my toes and feet and very soon I am not comfortable walking around in them. I normally love Clark brand shoes."
301260,1,"I read the reviews before buying these shoes and every one said how tight they were. I wear a medium shoe, I bought the normal size I always wear and these were not tight in fact they keep slipping off my heel. I bought some of the heel things that stick to the back of the shoe and that does not even help. I won't be buying another pair."
346074,1,I've been with my husband for 15 years and this is his 3rd pair in all that time. Great durable sandal with consitent high quality.
25950,0,dear sirplease send for me catalog and prices sport equipment.thank youb-aghazadeh
274149,0,"The boot was very comfortable and a great fit. I bought these some time back and just wore them for Halloween. I was disappointed after a couple hours of wearing them, that the heel fell off. If I could have found it, I could glue it back on, but I couldn't find it. Too bad, because these were really cute."
74974,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
323601,1,My husband has worn Reeboks for years. We moved to the beach and everyone wore Romeos because the salty wet weather is so harsh on shoes. When we moved back recently we could not find any at any store!! I was so frustrated as my husband rarely wants anything specific. I thought about Amazon... of course it worked! I now have a happy hubby!! Thanks Amazon!!!
292098,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
349275,1,This is my second pair. The tops outlast the bottoms but they are good quality. I have a c width foot so they are good for me. Everyone likes different sneakers for fit and quality. These are made well and will last about a year of daily use. I am satified with them and will keep buying them. Rob
2522,0,"These boots felt somewhat weird in their arch support. I have size 14-15 feet, and I have learned to be somewhat less picky since most stores don't carry my size. However I desired a comfortable boot that I can hike as well as work outside in. I had some LLBean boots that I worked into the ground, and unfortunately you just can't find quality that easily these days (I sound like my parents now).I cannot comment on Hi-Tec's durability or longevity because I ended up returning these boots and buying a pair of Wolverine work boots that were slightly more expensive."
197389,2,"Good looking shoes, but...after just 1 month,the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends. The shoe still looks perfect, but I had to use shoe goo to fix it. Seems like for the price, and for as long as this style has been around it shouldn't so this?!"
280875,1,The Keds are fine. I have had them for a few days now and they are great. No complaints at all.
167342,1,These are very comfortable clogs. They arrived promptly. I am very happy with this purchase. I will buy Easy Spirit again
267286,1,"I have owned over 8 pairs of these boots.They are well made,comfortable to wear as soon as they are taken out of the box and waterproof.They fit true to size.I highly recommend them to anyone that wants a great boot at a great value."
86787,1,converse are always great for outdoors. Perfect for people who break dance and also for style. First wear is not the best because it hurts your feet but after a month or so it will be comfortable. The only thing I dont like is because it is not water proof so if it rains then your feet gets wet no matter and its hard to slip shoes on like other athletic shoes.
377824,0,"Pro: good styling, looks good even with nicer casual clothes, very durable upper and tread, fully waterproofCon: VERY hard inner sole. Even with good replacement footbeds, harder and less confortable than other hiking shoes and boots I have owned."
327279,0,"These boots are beautiful and look like excellent quality. They arrived promptly.Unfortunately they are too big and we had to return them. The heel is too wide and the foot slips around inside. We ordered 1/2 size smaller than usual due to the reviews we read, but guess we should have gone a full size smaller."
274784,1,"I have owned these boots for over a year now but I did not want to review them before I had some sense of their durability. I have used them for hiking, swamp stomping, and as general winter boots and could not be more pleased with their comfort or quality. They have proven to be waterproof under semi-heavy use and show little sign of wear. The foot bed is well-shaped and extremely comfortable so the boots can be worn all day long without foot and knee pain (things I am susceptible to when wearing low quality footwear), though they are slightly warm in summer weather. Easily much more comfortable than my Merrel boots which cost close to $200 dollars and equal in quality. I have a size 10.5 to 11 foot on the wider end of the spectrum, I bought these in an 11 normal and the fit is great, though for particularly wide feet I believe that wide sizes are available. I can not recommend these highly enough."
81831,1,"I've bought this style of Deer Stags before. They run wide and I have 13 4E feet. Finding reasonably priced shoes in this size is difficult. I was happy to find these in a wide, instead of the usual D, to try out. These also run wide and fit better than the others I've bought. The shoes have nice padding inside and look fantastic. I would buy these again."
145269,1,Great warm boot. Perfect for indoor/outdoor comfort. Have worn shorter ugg and knockoff ugg boots before. Love these tall ones!
15212,1,I purchased these boots in september for the hunting season. I have recently purchased another pair for my father I liked them so much.
387001,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
369225,1,"I love these shoes! They are so comfortable, I end up wearing them all the time. They are great for days at the gym when I'm doing weight days ( so I don't have to wear my running shoes). I love walking around town in these shoes. My other shoes always made my feet hurt after a while. I've been complemented so many times on these shoes. I will probably buy my brother a pair of these for Christmas.The only issue I have, which is slight, is that the bottom sole seems to be made out of a flimsy plastics. Other than that the fabric of the shoe is very high quality, and the toe has a nice suede."
269947,1,This is by far the most comfortable shoe..It is a outstanding walking shoedoes not need to be broken in...ready to walk or just wear
130931,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S.

21875,0,Within 5 minutes my feet were sweating. They are comfortable and well padded but sadly I could just never wear them for this reason so I had to send them back
27735,1,"I have been wearing New Balance shoes for several years now, as they were recommended to me by a friend of mine that managed a sporting goods store. These shoes are very comfortable, and have made my workday go much better, as my old shoes were pretty worn out."
61443,1,"Excellent! Great product, great fit. Best price anywhere. Actually I still have these and wear them every day. I am actually going to order another pair very soon. Thanx"
104552,1,"My fiance wanted some new converse shoes for his birthday, so I searched the internet for awhile trying to find the best deal, this was definitely it! It was the best price paired with free shipping, and they came within a week, so that was great! They've also held up very well, and he loves them, so they get quite a bit of use!"
233341,1,"The Angioline Liberty Flats are available in numerous colors for a reason. The comfort, fit, quality, and appearance can't be beaten. No matter what you wear, there's a color of shoes to match, and they always look nice. I have many people ask me where I buy my shoes, and I'm more than happy to tell them. I recommend The Shoe Mall, and Angioline shoes to anyone who'll listen."
268610,1,"I am now on my second pair of this particular shoe and I would have to say that I am just as pleased with the second pair as I was with the first. I have to admit that the price is what I find the most appealing. These shoes are very hard to distinguish from its more expensive peers and I believe that few individuals would be able to tell the difference. My only complaints are that they do not hold a polish quite as well as I would like and the sole wore out a little quicker than I had expected. These problems can be cured, however, with frequent polishing and a trip to the cobbler to have a rubber sole glued on for a minimal fee. Even without the addition of the rubber sole, my first pair lasted for about six months with daily use. These shoes are perfect for those on a budget, and will certainly get the job done in style."
353856,1,They wear great and not so heavy. Look good too! Recieved in just a couple days. Would order these boots for anyone.
352006,1,"I like these shoes very much. I bought those black ones and they look awesome. Very lightweight but expensive. I dont run with them, so I cant say how these work on sports."
36094,0,"I currently own two pairs of the Danner Mountain Light II Boots because I liked my original pair so much, that I bought a second pair. In fact, had I written this review many years ago, when I first started using the original pair, I would have given them five stars. But alas, I cannot now do so.Yes, they are very comfortable boots, assuming you throw out the insoles they come with and use Superfeet Green insoles instead. Yes, the leather is buttery soft and very tough and durable. Yes, they can be resoled, which generally cuts down on your boot budget if you hike and climb a lot. Also, the Gore Tex liner keeps your feet dry except in extreme conditions. And, I give Danner a big thumbs-up for their recrafting department, which is super helpful and efficient.The problem is with the Vibram Kletterlift soles that are used. I have used boots of innumerable types with Vibram soles for as long as I can remember. My original Mountain Light pair had Kletterlifts which lasted a very long time before needing replacement. Unfortunately, Vibram soles are no longer made using the same formulary as they were a few years ago, so they wear terribly, especially in the lugs. I wear mine down to the mid sole in about a month or so of very hard use. As I live in Argentina, where no cobbler is capable of resoling these boots, I must return them to Danner in Oregon, an expensive proposition.This Vibram wear problem is not just with my Danner boots but also for example with my two pair of La Sportiva mountaineering boots, which have different Vibram soles, but the identical wear problem. With my La Sportiva boots, the soles are shot after just two weeks of hard use. I have spoken to people in the industry and they have assured me that it is not my imagination, that Vibram has changed their formulary.I can understand the dilemma for boot companies. Almost everyone insists on Vibram soles because of their past reputation. If a boot does not use Vibram its sales may suffer. The customer's desire for Vibram forces companies to use them. They are darned if they do and darned if they don't. But, I would like to think that the boot companies have enough influence with Vibram to get them to change the formulary back to what it once was.Danner, I beg of you, please rattle Vibram's cage and get them to change back!"
118140,1,"This is leather, and fine quality. Band is wider than some - will stay on at least. My 5 yr old has med width feet, size 10 in a shoe. This 10.5 was a little roomy even with the drawstring pulled, but for non-professional use, she will grow into in quickly. Is that traditional tan/pink color."
98168,1,"This shoes are very confortable, but the model I bought is too narrow for me. So, it does not keep its shape when I put in."
158960,0,"I carefully went over all the details before I ordered this pair of shoes. Hi tops - check. Size 7.5 - check. White - check. Chuck Taylor - check. Everything seemed excellent. That is, until I opened the box (which arrived just on schedule by the way). By some mistake I had received a pair of very nice looking low tops. Which would have been perfect if that was what I'd ordered. Now, the shoes have been sent back, and a new pair is on its way."
128203,1,"I got mine today. Mine is all black, from inside to outside. Looks even nicer than that of the picture. I like this boot."
155830,1,"I purchased this bag in black patent leather, and I love it! It is totally on trend with the patent finish, the chain and lobster claw hardware, and it is a perfect size for carrying my daily necessities without be so large that items get buried at the bottom. It is easy to open and get things in and out, and if I had more money right now, I would buy it in white too! This bag is a great value - grab it while you can!"
262299,2,"I received these and just had to send them back, they were to tight. I've never had issues with a shoe feeling tight. I have a regular foot, not wide or anything and have had shoes that fit snuggle, but could still wiggle my toes, these were just squeezing my foot and no room at all. Was very dissapointed."
12211,1,"I have every color known to man, and am always looking for more. I teach, so I am on my feet all day; I'm comfy and happy in my Converse All Stars! I must say that in my old age (40) I prefer the lo tops over the hi tops."
154194,1,My high school daughter loves these shoes. They are so comfortable and she can wear them with many types of pants.
17418,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
85562,1,"these slippers are very warm and comfortable, and they are fairly durable (we bought these to replace a well worn pair),"
1448,1,"the fit is good, are truly waterproof right out of the box, no break in period"
385314,1,My 10 yr old son has barely taken them off his feet since Christmas morning! He says they are very comfortable and he thinks they look awesome! Best gift this year!
203437,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
114976,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
102066,1,"I usually get a 9.5W in sandals, but the footbed was too long in this shoe and the back straps were way too loose. I reordered in a 9W and they fit a lot better, not perfectly.. but they are really cute. I throught they were pretty comfortable until I could feel the side of the zipper on one shoe cutting into my big toe. Hopefully it won't happen again!"
384209,1,"I love Amazon! I purchased these shoes a few weeks ago, the color and quality is phenomenal. I have not worn them yet, but I had them at my hair salon and all the women were in awe of my shoes.My only thought with Amazon is - if a shoe is not available, it should not be displayed as the model for that particular shoe.NY Shoe Princess"
228748,1,Took the advice of other reviews of this product and ordered a half-size under my usual shoe size. Perfect fit.
287042,1,attractive alternative to the SAS shoes I had been wearing for many years due to very bad bunions on both feet. Had them removed last year. The Rockports are very comfortable even when wearing them for 10-12 hours at a time. Price is incredibly low for a quality shoe. 1/2 SAS price.
315849,1,"We ordered two pairs of shoes from this retailer. They were very good deals and were very quickly delivered to us even with standard shipping. We are very happy with this transaction. (We: me, the one who pays, and my son, the one with who tears through skateboarding shoes at an alarming rate.)"
163431,1,"I went to a store to try on a couple different sizes. I usually wear an 11 1/2 but these only come in whole sizes. 11 was a tiny bit too small and my big toe hung over the edge a little bit so I went for a 12.I've heard that the toe loop annoys some people so I tried on a pair with and a pair without the toe loop. The Z/2 with the toe loop felt much more secure and didn't annoy me or feel uncomfortable.The diamond pattern hash't bothered my feet at all.I work at a camp and have been walking around in these all day. They haven't bothered me one bit.I also wore them in water and swam a short distance with them on while lifegaurding. They were secure and comfortable while swimming.A little sand did get caught between my foot and the footbed, but was easy to wash out in the water.The strap took a little while to dry (Maybe 15-20 minutes) but that doesn't bother me.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. They are secure, comfortable, and have great support.Go Chacos!"
222087,1,"I was keeping my fingers crossed with these, and, so far, Initially, I was pleasantly surprised with the fit. These actually run large. I should have bought a half-size smaller. I originally posted a review for a different shoe, the Sebago Loafer, which is an absolutely wonderful loafer the review which I will be posting soon.I also bought these as a gift for someone, and those also run a but too large. She's decided to keep them, anyway...she loves these that much. She mentioned she'd stuff something at the front of the loafer so she could walk in them. That's love.As for me, I will be returning these for another pair of the Sebago Loafer.Thank you."
94781,1,I purchased these shoes for my mom for my upcoming wedding and she just loves them. She says they are very comfortable and will have love use of them in the future. They are well constructed and have a very good width to them. i would purchase them myself and would recommend them to anyone who wants a quality and comfortable shoe.
257264,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
264138,0,"The shoe is really green, very much like a pale-ish olive green. It is not at all the nearly white shoe shown. It seemed like a hint of green/like wintergreen in the pic.Also, they were 1/2 size larger than the normal size-and your foot slides to the front, leaving a gap at the back regardless of the little strap that can't hold you back. So, if you order a 9.5 and wear a 10, you'll be okay. I wear an 8.5 & the 8.5 was large. I have a slightly wide foot & it fit okay there. It is an otherwise really nice, cute, semi-comfy shoe-not for the whole day or whole night dancing. I would give it 4 stars if they advertised the true color. 5 if the size was closer & if it were more comfortable."
160325,1,I got them today around the time they said they would be here. The shoes were in great condition inside the box and they were just what I expected to be. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I would order from them again.
223520,1,"This particular shoe is the best all around shoe i have ever owned. They last forever. Are comfortable in Hot and Cold weather. I have recommended this shoe to many many people. Its getting harder and harder to find this particular color and style. I wish reebok would make them more readily available. If you can find a pair BUY THEM, you wont be sorry..."
95369,1,"these are known for beign awsome shoes... & they are! the only problem for me was, not trying them on, so the narrow/medium width became an issue!"
369204,1,This is my first pair of Reef sandles and I have found them to be very comfortable. They run a little small as I usually wear a 7.5 but ordered the 8 for a perfect fit.
375478,1,"I've never written a review before, but these shoes are so amazing it is worthy of my time to tell you. First, If you are like me in thinking Reebok's shoes are normally too narrow; think again. Reebok has decided to lead the way in a truly extra wide shoe that is comfortable! I've tried every brand out there in the athletic stores & this is the only one that doesn't rub any place on my foot. The comfort soles will have you believing you are walking on 10"" of high density foam. It is the most comfortable pair of shoes I've ever owned in 40 years. I have a bad knee and live on tile floors. These shoes absorb all the shock & my knee does not hurt at the end of the day. I wear 2 orthotics inside my shoe and the high toe box accommodates this easily without rubbing my foot against the top of the shoe. You can't go wrong with these. BTW: They are $50 at Academy Sports & Outdoors.FOLLOW UP JULY 2009.I'm sorry to say that I had purchased 3 pairs of these shoes incase they were discontinued. I'm into the 2nd and 3rd pair and both are different than the first pair I reviewed above. They seem smaller and more narrow than the 1st pair. It dawned on me that someone else won the contract (China more than likely) to make the ""run"" of shoes I bought. I just want to let you know that I've learned something. If you find a shoe that you really like and want to buy several pairs to put away, BE SURE TO TRY THEM ON FIRST. I just assumed by checking they were both the same size that it was the same shoe WITH THE SAME FIT since I bought it at the same place. Not true. I suspect the manufacturer made these pairs to the smaller side of the specifications. I WISH WE COULD FIND THINGS MADE IN THE USA, ONCE AGAIN. Bummer."
270602,2,"Out of the box, these slippers are pretty much among the worst things I've ever put my feet into. And I once stepped barefoot into dog poop.First of all, they reek. It smells like play-dough, not like new shoe. I like new shoe smell. It's a good smell, it's a nostalgic smell. Play-dough? On my feet? Not so much. They're moderately soft, which I can live with. But really, slippers should be like putting your feet into clouds. They're for relaxing, taking a load off. If I wanted support I'd wear my shoes. I want something I can wear around the house, indoors and out, and imagine I'm on sunshine. These are more like I'm on the moon. Don't get me wrong, I like the moon, it rules, but definitely not what I was expecting. They just don't feel like a slipper. They feel more like a furry shoe. Could be a positive if you're into that sorta thing.But really, those are the least of my qualms. The reason these slippers are so horrible is that the stitching on the inside is sub par. Strike that, it's sub sub par. It's so sub par it's almost circled around and become above par. The elastic binding the top to the sides just sticks out there, scratching the tops of your feet. It's really quite uncomfortable, and a little disconcerting. Here's an idea for the manufacturer: PUT THE ELASTIC BEHIND THE FAKE FUR. Really, it's not that hard a concept. I want my foot in fluffy dammit! How am I supposed to enjoy fake fluffy if I've got hard, scratchy elastic rubbing against my feet?Who knows, maybe they'll break in. I'm willing to give these slippers the benefit of the doubt. That's why I'm giving them two stars instead of one. I bought them on sale for $10 so I'm not gonna cry over spilled milk. If they were $25 slippers I'd demand my money back. That's the sorta level of slipper where you expect, nay, demand quality. These? I'm a bit just disappointed mostly. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I've been psyching myself up for slippers too much. I really wanted to treat myself to a pair. After going barefoot in the house for so long, I feel like I deserved something. Maybe I set my expectations too high. I haven't worn slippers since I was 10, and those were gorilla slippers. And let me tell you, gorilla slippers... well... there's your life pre-gorilla-slippers and your life post-gorilla-slippers. Maybe they set the bar too high... but I don't really think so. Honestly, I think these are just crappy slippers.Maybe I'll take some play-dough and round off the edges of the elastic. Or maybe I'll just hope they scratch my feet, infect them, and then I'll start a class-action lawsuit against the manufacturer. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I had tried these slippers on in the store, I would have passed on them. You might wanna consider that too, unless you like scratched play-dough feet. I don't judge."
170379,1,"The boots arrived before expected, which was good. The boots fit very good and I wear them almost every day.Couldn't have a better pair."
311867,1,The shoes arrived in the mail in a coulpe of days.....the no shipping was a great plus. They are high quality and comfortable.....after the first day. The first night they pinched my little toe but then streched out. I know I would have paid significantly more had I bought them at the mall. The girls at work thought they were cute too:)
287388,1,"We purchased these black Capezio Little Kid tap shoes, size 1 medium, for my five-year-old son's first tap/jazz dance session this summer. Yesterday, he performed at the Ventura County Fair with his class of three- to five-year-old kids, and had lots of fun! The shoes are holding up well after six weeks of tapping, but there are two things you might want to know: 1.) the size 1 medium fits pretty snugly, and if there had been a size 1.5 available, the fit might have lasted a bit longer for my son -- since half-sizes weren't available, probably should have purchased a size 2, even though his sneakers are size 1; 2.) The taps seem to be of good quality but, like all taps, they are quite slippery -- his teacher suggested to parents that the kids should scuff up the tap bottoms on a cement driveway or patio, so that the taps aren't so slippery for the kids when they have to walk on the dance floor. This is a great tip, and something a new ""tapping"" family might not know!"
254086,1,"I ordered these sneakers for my cousin. He loves them! Great pair of basic sneakers that blends well with any outfit. Great decision, rather than over priced sneakers!"
358368,0,"I purchased these shoes a half size larger than I normally wear and found them still very tight. Toe area is quite narrow. Otherwise, well made and good height for dancing."
178245,1,"i could not find this particular sneaker in 8 1/2 wide and tried all over, some how amazon suddenly flashed it like magic. i love these sneakers and bought 2 immed. ITS LIKE THEY WERE READING MY MIND! reebok classics soft comfy real leather. i live in these sneakers!"
110629,1,"First off, I'm not really a kid, but I don't want to sign up for an acount. Know that. I bought a pair a couple months ago. They obviously get kudos in the cool facter right off the bat. Then I put them to the real test. On the court. They are super comfortable and are still holding up great. They also breathe very well.This brings me to the only problems. Soon after I bought a pair, my friend did too. He plays in them not only on the hard-court, but on the black top when he's practicing also. Therefore he uses them A LOT. A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins. I've only heard of this happening to a couple people, but if you abuse your shows as much as my friend does, you might want to look else where. Also the sound of the pump is audible. Not terribly noticable, expecialy on the court.All in all, this is a great shoe and really encourage you buying it. Whether you want it for hoops or for style, it's sick no matter what."
308656,1,These boots are so comfortable that I often wear them around the house. They are pretty good at keeping my feet warm and they haven't allowed any water to get in yet. It's nice to wear a real American boots that are so well made.
181088,0,"This shoe is so cute and adorable, I simply wish that my feet weren't so wide. Although looking at the shoe gives the appearance that they will be uncomfortably high heels to walk in, the shoe was very confortable and will be most suited for someone with narrow feet. It's black and whit"
298568,1,"This is the fourth pair of these boots my husband has owned. He uses them for work. They last, stay dry & keep his feet warm during cold Ohio winters. Amazon has very competitive pricing for these too."
136529,1,The ordering process was easy. The wait was not long. The product was perfect!!!
354427,1,"These are my second pair of Earth Lazers. I have a narrow foot, size 11, and they fit just perfectly. The heel is snug, and the toebed is more of a medium fit. But, when you walk in these shoes, the weight falls towards the heel, so you don't really need a narrow toe box. I did order them in a size ten, instead of the 11, and my foot feels supported and secure. It's great for someone with a bad back too. They are ultra light and fit easily into luggage for travel. You are probably not supposed to wash these, but I did in a low setting. They came out just fine. I don't think you should put them in the dryer, however. The price offered on Amazon, in conjunction with the Amazon credit card, made this too hard to resist. So glad I got them. Highly recommended!"
224300,1,"I got a pair for myself and absolutely loved them. They are comfortable and versatile. My husband liked them, too, and wanted a pair for himself. So now we have a pair of matching shoes that we each enjoy. They were delivered in a timely manner (both times)... I recommend these shoes and this seller."
385020,1,Very comfortable flip flops that always spring back to original shape after taking them off! I have all colors and love them all!!
277213,1,"I have this Crocs Beach Clog finally after trying another style in my size. I also have the Wrapped Clog (very nice) BUT in womens sizes- the size labeled 8 is really just over a size 9...........and in unisex sizing- to get an 8, i ordered a women's 6-7.......otherwise i love crocs~"
782,0,This review is not about the quality of the shoe (which looked quite satisfactory) but about the sizing.The shoe runs both small and narrow (even though i ordered a wide).FYI- if that happens and you have to return it- You will have to pay for the return shipping to amazon
65471,1,"These are simply the best running/approach shoes I have ever worn. I was thrilled to find them on Amazon as they are impossible to buy in Europe; I have been trying all this year. Why 'La Sportiva' are you not selling these or the newer version,the womens Exum Pro anywhere in Europe? Crazy, it is such a good shoe!"
299096,1,Comfortable and classic Clarks style...can't go wrong! These are the most comfortable shoes in my closet. You rock these to work and hold it down after hours.
293269,1,"The ASICS Gel Kayano XI is a superbly cushioned shoe not just for running but for walking, areobics, or just wearing around. I have worn the Kayano series for several years--tried another shoe this fall which just didn't measure up--so I am back with my favorites--the Gel Kayano. The fit is size perfect, the cushioning forms to my foot, the light weight keeps me moving with ease and the color selection which ASICS gives the Kayano is a nice bonus. Even thought they are pricey, I will watch the sales and only buy Kayanos from now on."
349870,1,My daughter used them lots. They are very comfortable and affordable. A good choice for everyday tasks and school. It's highly recommended for kids and teens.
143581,1,"Nice everyday shoe. The soles do wear a bit early from past experience, but overall a very comfortable shoe that looks good with jeans or khakis. Super fast shipping from Amazon and the best price anywhere."
170812,1,I have a very narrow foot. Hard and expensive to fit. VANELi is one of the few shoes that meet my needs. These flats are great - can dress up or down. Would like to have a pair in every color.
24894,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
315598,1,"I have an excessivly wide foot. This purchase ended a long search for a boot that felt as I thought it should feel, with no pinched feet. The boot is soft supple leather but not too soft as to lose it's shape. Being an older person I looked for a lighter weight boot this one fits the bill, speaking of which, was at a very good price. I would give this boot a 4 1/2 star rating"
207064,1,"I already have two pairs exactly like these (one in white, one in tan), and I just purchased a third pair (this time from Amazon) in black. So my entire wardrobe is now covered for all colors.These shoes are extremely comfortable (like walking on air), and the Velcro closing is great (tying shoelaces is very difficult for me).The style is versatile -- I can wear these shoes with casual or formal clothing, and anything inbetween."
222397,1,"After my shepherd puppy gave my favorite pair of slippers the death blow by dismembering them into numerouse pieces, I decided I needed to go to my ""go to"" moccasin company. This company makes the best moccasins you can buy as far as I'm concerned. I do always order a half size down (order 8 instead of 8.5)because Minnetonkas tend to run large. If they don't fit you know how easy it is to return things to Amazon. They are soft as can be, super fluffy-lined and a sheer pleasure to wear. I live in Florida and it's 90 degrees outside right this minute so I'm not wearing them today. You can wear them for a few hours when it's hot outside, but I found my feet getting too moist so I switch over to unlined moccasins."
318691,0,"These shoes are not correctly sized - they are much smaller than marked, so beware."
337729,1,NOTHING CAN EVER TAKE THE PLACE OF A TRIED & TRUE PAIR OF CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STARS. (WE CALLED THEM BO-BOS IN THE 70'S)
245380,1,I bought these socks for my husband. He has not stopped talking about how much he loves them. They are nice and warm. He wears them everyday when he relaxes.
27263,1,"Great infant dress shoes (I never thought I would be in the market for those!) My 22 month old son just wore them to his uncle's wedding. Everyone stopped and stared at him, he looked so cute. It goes well with the infant boys suit I bought for him."
378933,1,"Back when I was in school we bought these every year for show choir. They were amazing shoes, that held up very well. For dancers, they are the best. They work best on stage in tan, judges always told us black shoes distracted the audience from your face. They do tend to run small if my memory serves right, order a full size up (they do have wide sizes too). The bottoms are a little slick, but if you buy some guards to put on the bottom, or spray some hairspray on them, you won't have to worry about slipping around."
374936,1,"I don't wear a uniform for a living, never have, never will. Being an ornery sort I don't think I'd do well as a cop, questioning everything and not wanting to do the ruling class's dirty work for them for a mere pittance.But I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night and I have to say these are great boots for anyone. I started wearing these after a roommate who was in AFROTC sold me on them. They're very nice boots regardless of being marketed as a LE/military boot, much different than a work boot and more like a hiking boot. In fact, I also own these in brown sold as the Danner Foothill, which is marketed as a hunting boot and is the exact same except it has speedlaces and comes in basic brown instead of JBT black. Either way, my plain toe Acadias have been through a lot over four years for work and play and they're still going strong.Pros:1) They're light and comfortable compared to a work boot. Period. For what you're getting they're incredibly light, I have no idea how Danner does this beyond using a cordura upper to save weight. However, I imagine if you went to these from a tennis shoe you'd find them heavy.2) They're durable. After four years of every other day wear (I alternate with other boots to extend their life) mine have worn soles but that's about it. I imagine I'll get another year or two out of them before sending them in to be resoled for a nominal cost by Danner just because. I use the Danner boot dressing periodically to recondition the leather and brush off the cordura and that's it. They're as maintenance free as a farm girl and work just as hard too.3) They're completely waterproof to the shin and that's not hype. I walked two miles to work and back in them today (six inches of snow this morning; six inches of slush tonight) and my feet are bone dry while the cuffs of my pants are iced over. The breathe well also thanks to the cordura upper. I've blown out other waterproof boots in less than a year (their name is real similar to a hockey team up north) and was told by the vendor it's due to grit and dirt working their way into the boot and ruining the GoreTex bootie. My Acadias nearly always have a little bit of Colorado, a little bit of Montana, and a little bit of San Diego on them from work travel and even with neglect the GoreTex is still perfect. Interesting. I've snowshoed successfully with these too if that tells you anything.4) The Vibram sole is classic and functional and works well on concrete, pavement, and off road. Not so good on snow and ice but what is?5) The lace to toe means you can snug them down over a thin sock or loosen them up over a thicker sock. Very versatile.6) Despite not being insulated they're somehow warm. I have cold feet and I routinely wear these with a good wool sock down to +10-deg F with no problem. Below that they get a little chilly.7) They're made in the US and Danner will take care of you (within reason) if you have a problem. Some people don't care about the made in the US aspect; I do. BTW, I won't buy China made Danners. Read the reviews on them first.8) Zero break in period. Put them on and wear them.Cons (these are very minor; these are damn near a perfect set of boots unless you ride horses or climb poles for a living):1) These have no arch support in any way, form, or fashion. If you order a pair online without handling them I'm here to tell you these are flatter than Kansas on the inside. Ditch the subpar provided ""orthotic"" and get some quality after market insoles (not from ChinaMart either; I run SuperFeet and Sole insoles in all my boots with great success) with real arch support if you need it.2) They fit narrow. My understanding is all the US-made stitchdown Danners run narrow, so if you're on the ragged edge of having a wide foot as I am, go for the wide as these are not forgiving at all in width. I ordered a pair of Ds, laced 'em up, pulled 'em on, hobbled around the office for a few minutes, sent 'em back promptly. The wide widths fit great if you have a wideish foot and you can suck down any extra width with the laces.3) The provided laces suck. Not a big deal. Gutted 550 cord for laces will last longer than my starter marriage and work great too.4) The TSA loves my Acadias for some reason. I rarely get past the Thugs Standing Around without the Thugs fondling my Danners without dinner and a kiss first and swabbing them down for residue. Maybe it's my overall appearance. Dunno. YMMV.That's about it. I have four pairs of Acadias (plain toe Acadia, steel toe Acadia, insulated plan toe Acadia, and the Foothill) with hard use and lots of miles on them and they will not die.Buy 'em if you need 'em for work or play, run 'em hard like they're made to be used, and send 'em back to Danner to be spiffed up as needed. They'll be like an old friend in a few months I promise."
369581,1,Looked all over and could not find these anywhere including the Vans outlet here locally. Arrived on time and fit great.Love my Vans!!!
36660,1,Just received. I loved it at the first sight.I will review the product again after hiking.but only one pair of shoelaces. It would be better will we can have one more yellow pair of shoelaces.
202972,0,"I was totally satisfied with the purchase of the Keen sandales, but unfortunately, I guess my feet have expanded since I ordered a replacementfor the 10.5 size sandles I have, but when they arrived they were too tight. I had to pay for return shipment to the company, which amounted to $ 13.90.I tried to get the sandales replaced with size 11, but I have been notified that my account has been credited and if I want a new pair of sandals I need to order them again.Paul H.Sammelwitz"
297266,1,"Never owned a pair of Tim's before. Took them out for an all day hike and WOW! Really resistant to water, comfortable, and are durable. look forward to owning these for a few years."
36703,1,"very cheap for Keds, fits excellent, got it really fast in two days, i just love them they ar very confortable and looks well with everything. Totally worth it:)"
229176,1,I love my converse! You should get some too. I love theway they look and smell when they are brand new! They come in allKind of colors and you can make your own . they have lasted on theMarket since 1935! You need to run and your own pair right now!
235186,1,I am very pleased with these shoes. Only wish I could get them in white also. If available let me know
289700,1,"These sandals work exactly the way i pictured them. The bottom is rough and has got a nice sneaker pattern on them to give me the grip of real shoes, and the top straps are good enough to keep my feet in. With it being a Sandal, it feels like being in a convertible where you get all the comfort of a regular pair of shoes, but your feet can breath. Great as a pair of summer shoes."
354801,0,"I love these shoes. However, I ordered the wrong size and exchanging them has been a hassle. It has been over a month and I do not have the shoes or the money and no one can seem to help me."
139084,0,"Although these boots were so cute, they just felt heavy and clunky on my feet. Heel-to-toe step seemed too much like work. Knew I wouldn't wear very often and if I did, not for very long, so decided to return."
18195,1,"I have every color known to man, and am always looking for more. I teach, so I am on my feet all day; I'm comfy and happy in my Converse All Stars! I must say that in my old age (40) I prefer the lo tops over the hi tops."
51038,1,"quality at a great price, very soft and confortable fit, stylish strap.fast shipping. What more can you expect from flip flops"
76686,1,Would of liked the leather thicker.But compares to other shoes that I have bought at a much higher price. Good buy.
6013,1,MuCh more comfortable than they look. Everything old becomes new again. Platforms are in once more.
79298,1,"I got these for my brother for Christmas, and he loved them. What more can i say? Converses are awesome for anybody!"
202242,0,"Good looking shoe -- I've worn it about 15 times boating -- they do a good job relative to grip on the boat -- however, the leather is showing wear at this point I didn't expect. The color is fading in some areas and not in others. They shoes appear a lot older than they are."
348883,1,"Awesome shoes that I've bought several times over the years. I love the nondescript style and the (somewhat) retro look. Low key, nothing flashy but very cool.They're getting harder to find. Here's hoping Reebok keeps making these."
138921,1,"shoes are supportive, and wear well on both roads and trails."
24387,1,"I'm in my forties and I should note that most people of my age grew up thinking of Mizuno as a &quot;speciality sport&quot; shoe. When I started wearing Wave Riders four years ago, the comments I got from friends were along the lines of &quot;I thought they made baseball [or volleyball] shoes.&quot;But, trust me: Mizuno makes great running shoes. The Wave Rider is - in my mind - the best 'cushion' shoe on the market today. With this seventh generation release of the model, Mizuno demonstrates it understands three important things about running shoes:- Most runners want a good high-mileage shoe for under $100. [The Wave Rider has stayed under $90 retail for all seven model releases.]- When runners find a shoe they like, they get ripped when the company either drops the model or radically re-imagines it for the next release. The Wave Rider has been incrementally tweaked and improved over the years, but the basic shoe remains the same.- I'm a runner. I don't want a hip, street shoe where style is first, running mechanics second. The Wave Rider is where it ought to be on the spectrum: there's a nod towards style, but I don't feel like a fashion victim.One sizing note: I traditionally take an 11 in all other types of shoes, but I need an 11.5 for the Wave Rider. That's been very consistent throughout the years."
205226,1,"These are hands down the best looking slip on sneakers around. Great price, great style and feel. Just wish amazon had more sizes available."
270480,0,"The shoes are quite comfortable, but I find them very uncomfortable while doing extended exercise walking."
249548,1,"I bought these for my Dad and they were a little too big. He wears a size 10 1/2 so I bought him an 11 and it did not work out.He said they were very comfy, though, and they looked nice and elegant.I wish they had half sizes in these slippers... sadly they don't so I had to ship the pair I bought back."
386455,1,"While I enjoy my 574's, and I plan to buymore pairs, they are not made in theUSA as a previous reviewer indicated. My574's say ""Made in China"" on the tongue."
205432,1,"I've worn Fort Lewis boots in my home state of Alaska for five years. They have taken plenty of abuse, including two runs down the Chilkoot Trail. Not only are they still intact, but they are still waterproof - pretty astounding for leather boots. They require almost no breakin and are a whole lot lighter and more comfortable than my Wescos. But Danners run a bit narrow. Go for the D width if you normally wear a 'C' or 'B'. Otherwise, I suggest you might avoid having to hassle with returns by purchasing EE width. The Danner D is narrower than that of other shoe manufacturers."
62666,1,"I love Keds tennis shoes. Denim is very hard to find and I'm thankful Amazon is so easy to shop. No muss, no fuss. Just find the product and someone brings it to your door. I must say, though, that there should never be s&h charges on anything. Bank rates and credit card rates are getting too difficult to live with without having to considering s&h."
36689,2,"After reading some of the other reviews, I hesitated to purchase these Keds but decided to take a chance anyway. That was a mistake. The Keds that arrived the other day are nothing like I remember (and I lived in Keds for many years). These are a very cheap version of the sturdy, supportive Keds of yesteryear that fit like a glove and lasted forever. The new ones are also quite a bit narrower, thinner, pointed in the toe, and feel like something you'd get at a dollar store for a few bucks. Returning this product for a refund and won't be purchasing Keds in the future."
127837,1,"First I like the boots, but I have calf's that are larger than 14""s. That is why I ordered a lager size. They fitted fine, but when I was removing them the zippers got jammed and on one I had to destroy the zipper to get it off and the other I was able to remove with the zipper still jammed. I whish they made a boots that are not all the way to below the knee. I do superhero costumes and I like the range of colors they have. I would to liked to know more information on getting boots for a larger calf's I am not the only person that has this problem and now I may have to order a second pair of boots to replace the ones that got damaged."
32160,1,"Wow! This is one of the most comfortable pair of sandals I've ever put on my feet. The fit is true to size. If they weren't white, I'd still be wearing them after Labor Day since they are soooooo comfortable!"
22157,0,"I absolutely loved these shoes; they're amazingly comfortable, and they're generally good looking. That's why when they started falling apart, it really disheartened me. Their good looks started to wear down, as the leather in the front started to lose its color, and the sole of the shoe began to fall apart on the sides and back.Overall, I still really like the shoes, but they're no longer acceptable to wear in the office. I'll find a use for them somewhere, somehow, but it won't be when my appearance is being judged."
57200,2,These shoes are not as good as they used to be. Very little support. The sole is very thin. Definetly not worth the price.
192573,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
242983,1,"I purchase this shoe in white or white with the blue collar (size 7W) for work about every 10-12 months. I rotate the older shoes to yard work or donate. I have had one pair out of about 6 or 7 split open where the upper and sole meet at the ball of the foot. That surprised me but I had gotten plenty of wear out of it. I also own a pair of blue suede for jeans. Overall, I've been happy with them."
81493,1,"I gave this snikers to my 15 year-old son and he loved. It has a juvenile color and it can use it daily, are confortables, the color is durable. Their friends have liked it. I recommend it"
367837,1,i loved the mocs...totally..but one was 1/2 size bigger than the other one...but it was marked the same..maybe should check on quality control
252138,1,"I LOVE these boots! I don't know much about cowboy boots, but I love these! The colors and the stitching are absolutely beautiful! The stitching on the top of the foot is far enough forward that it shows when I wear jeans. I was a little worried that the black sole would look tacky with brown and pink boots, but it looks fine. I wear a 9.5 and I found these to be true to size. They were a little tight across the top of my foot, but after I wore them for a couple of days, they stretched out and fit perfect. I have low arches and found them to have great arch support. I wore them for 3 days straight right after I got them and didn't have any problems with blisters or rubbing."
64921,1,"These are great run around shoes and camping. Light weight so you'renot logged down on short hikes. Don.t show dirt and i,ve washd them in the past. I wear 8.5 N andthese shoes fit pefectly. Nice navy lighter than shown but not toolight. Avazoncame through again for me. Jakjaneus"
101123,1,"I really like this shoe! It's hard for me to find a shoe as narrow as I need, but this one fits just right across the toes and on the heel. It's a little wide at the instep, but I can definitely live with it. I was a little dissappointed to find there is no arch support. I think if there were a support, the wideness would disappear."
319909,1,"This shoe is very comfortable. The only thing you might want to consider is that as this is a remake of a ""vintage"" style, the sizes tend to run a little smaller compared to a more modern shoe, IMO. I typically wear a 9 or 9.5 in a ""new"" shoe, but in the older adidas ""originals"" styles, I buy a 10."
158610,1,"This is the best running shoe I have ever owned! I had trouble with my LCL, not anymore. I used to start to get tired after 4 miles, I can go twice as long with these. If you have flat, narrow feet and small ankles, this is the shoe for you. Pretty good arch support. Could use more, but I'm not complaining!! I hope they never discontinue this shoe!"
181483,0,"I ordered the Sperry Women's Eye Sahara and received the ""Men's"" model.I returned them and tried to reorder the women's style and was advised by your Help Chat Room ""Don't order this item."" ""Look at Reviews"""
194650,1,"Best sandal I have ever purchased! I have every color, but still keep on buying them, mostly in black. Always want to have a pair or 2 that looks brand new. Thay are SO comfortable, especially if you have foot or leg problems. I am 63 and have been buying these for at least the last 8 years. I do have foot problems and sometimes they are the only shoe that I can wear. I am in love with these sandals. The metallic ones are good if you want something a little dressy. Again, so comfortable, well made and they last a long time!"
92734,1,The shoe stretcher works as advertised. It fits into shoes very easily and it stretches them. I would recommend it.
286488,1,"I like this model shoe enough to have 2 pair of them, in 2 colors. Quality is good, and they are very comfortable.A couple tips to pass along. Yes these have a distressed look, which shows up more with darker colors. I feel it adds to their character - just beware of this finish. Keep in mind that these go GREAT with worn jeans, so it's a good match.The other important tip is that these do run large in size. This style has a large toebox already, but they are still a wee bit long. But they are a tad wide as well. Ultimately it's the insole shape that makes these a shoe that you might want to fall back a size on, or if you wear a half-size, drop the half. As example for me, I normally wear mens 13. I could wear these in 13 as well and deal with the slightly longer length and width, but size 12 was overall more comfortable for me due to the insole shape and foot positioning. This makes a big difference when you are walking with these.Overall I am very pleased! I have knocked them back 1 star simply due to their not being true to normal size."
138394,1,"This is my absolute favorite summer shoe. I have it in brown, green and cream. Super comfy and stylish all the while a life saver for your back. I have an antique shop and am on my feet all day on concrete. Since I started wearing these sandals my sore feet and back are so much better. Comfortable from the first day of wearing them. They do leave a bit of a mark on the top of your foot if you wear them all the time. It's worth the comfort and cute style!"
63256,1,"LOVE these. Got them in grey with yellow laces- LOVE this color combo. They are true to size, comfy with or without socks (thin socks), and clean very easy. I use oxyclean spray and/or put them in the washer and they come out squeaky clean. So glad I got these!"
105145,1,"Bought a pair of these for my girlfriend, who wears them to work. Last time I heard her complain about her feet. Now I hear about the hours she works:-)"
262990,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
378550,0,"Shoe looks beautiful... in the website! I ordered it, put ""expidted shipment"" on it, and I never received... I got an email that my order was going to be ""delayed"", then it was cancelled. I was terribly disappointed. My word of caution: don't get your hopes up. It may be out of stock before you get to try them."
15779,1,Greatest Most durable boots I've ever purchased. I'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid. All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost. I'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting.
174130,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
132150,1,This shoe is off da chain i bought this shoe when it came out. I gots the blue and white ones and they comfterable as hell they gots a spring in the sole so dat the wheel spins the only bad thing is that when you walk you hear the air from the spring but overall this shoe is off da hizzle.
322054,1,"It's a great ballet shoe, nice leather and sole piece--seem well made. Unfortunately I thought street shoe size would work for this also. It didn't. I had to send it back and get another size up. You might want to get a size larger too..but great for the price!"
377625,1,"I absolutely love Danner boots! This is my third pair in eight years and I am not easy on them! I am a State Trooper and my boots are a very important part of my uniform. They must be tough, comfortable, long lasting, and able to shine up like a new penny! These boots fit the bill in every area. Best of all, Amazon was $70 cheaper than every other place on the Internet....plus the shipping is free! When you ship them to rural Alaska, that is a BIG deal! Thank you Amazon for offering high quality products at great prices!"
244691,1,Very Cool! My friends told that they look cool with jeans and whatever I dress and my Bro asked for a pair!
275618,1,"My husband loved his first pair of these boots so much, when he wore them out, he wanted another pair. So we ordered them online at Amazon.com, great price and quick service."
151822,1,Ordered 3 pair of these at the same time. Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Have already recommended them to others.
273458,0,they arent that confortable. They fit kind of tight at the end of the shoe
61799,1,Had my first pair for seven years. Most comfortable shoes/boots I've ever found. Just a little too worn to look nice. I'll use them around the yard. Paid even less for the new pair than I did seven years ago. Thanks Amazon!
142834,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
253590,1,"This is only my second pair of cowboy boots and I love them. They fit great, they don't clump around and I even ran for a second in them and they did not hurt my feet. I do not think they look too long (long toes) either. I am not used to western boots yet, so was a bit worried. These just look great. They look ""nice"" but somewhat casual, too. My feet are pretty wide, so I got the W. These run a bit wide, anyway, so don't get the W unless you really have some wide feet."
100281,1,"The shoes I got were the pink glitter ones. They were true to fit, perfect for my Halloween costume and very comfortable. I gave only 4 stars because they were a little stiff and the glitter caused some snags in my knee high stockings. Overall, highly recommended."
293275,0,"These shoes aren't super comfortable, but they aren't UNcomfortable. I only wear them for about an hour at a time for adult intramurals, so they are perfect for that purpose. The red color is fun and they get the job done. For the price, they're great."
77111,1,I took the advice of the previous reviews and order two sizes up. They fit perfectly. Been to several classes so far and wearing really well.
268757,1,Comfortable and good shock resistance. Waterproof. Not the prettiest shoe in the market but very functional and a sensational price!
151848,1,I love this shoe. It is the most comfortable shoe I have ever had. I am 70 years old & must have comfortable shoes to stay on my feet for any length of time. I love the easy way it slips on. Great for travel but great for us oldies that need ease of use. I take a wide & it fit perfectly.
65492,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
334633,1,These are the second pair of Wallabee boots I've bought for my son. He won't wear anything but these. They wear well.
49451,0,"I liked the boots, they fit comfortably. However after wearing them a few tims one of the lace hooks broke loose. Still wearable though, and I enjoy my boots alot."
312772,1,"Muchas gracias, compre desde venezuela sin ningun problema, me llego la mercancia a tiempo y en buen estado, como acordadon recibi la mercancia en la direccion acordada, muy agradecido"
99535,1,"These shoes are great. They are really comfortable, and very fashionable as well. Could be lighter but I would buy them again!"
140967,1,"I just received my new pair of Dr. Scholl's original sandals today. I got the suede camo ones with the pink buckle and pink lining. Walked around in them around the house all morning, and they fit well (I wear a size 10 and they are true to size). I adjusted the buckle so that they were a bit tighter on my foot and that old toe-grip feeling that I remember was almost the same as when I was a girl! Overall, I love them except for one thing: the lining is a very thin, hot pink synthetic type of material. I was expecting the lining to be suede or at least a soft, fuzzy type of fabric. That part is a bit stiff on the tops of my feet, so I am hoping it breaks in and becomes a little softer with wear. Otherwise, they fit great, the straps adjusted fine, and the color is cute and fun for summer!"
29480,1,"FINALLY...a sneaker that is comfortable from day one! I received my shoes today and put them on immediately. I had a lot of errands to run so they were put to a real test. I live in New York where you've got to move with the flow. Well from the minute I put them on I was comfortable. First the fit was fabulous. They are true to size. Then I was on my way. I was out for 4 1/2 hours; it was like walking on cushions. I am a heavy woman, with osteoarthritis and they gave me total support. When I got home...no blisters...no breaking in redness and all with no socks! I would highly recommend these to anyone who does a lot of walking and would gladly purchase them again."
357113,1,"I usually wear a street size 8 1/2 narrow or slim and I ordered this shoe in a few different sizes. The 9 1/2 narrow fit the bill perfectly. The shoes are great for the stage/dance and so comfortable I'd wear them as street shoes if they had my size in the caramel.If you look at the shoe in the box (at least in the narrow width), it is a fairly slender-cut shoe so if you have a narrow foot, fear not--this shoe should fit you fine."
370522,1,These shoes are cute and great for standing at my pharmacy job. Thank you
231068,1,"If you have any kind of hip, knee or ankle problem, these are the shoes for you. These shoes ensure you are placing your weight down on the proper part of your foot - not on the outside, for instance, which is the tendency of runners. Correct foot placement ensures the knees bear the weight correctly and off loads the hip joints. As an old runner and athlete, I began to have serious pain in my knees because I had worn the cartiledge down on the exterior part of my knees; these shoes have saved my having knee replacement at this time. I now walk properly and, consequently, my knees are rolling over the central and interior portion of cartiledge, areas which are not worn out. Recommend you order a half size larger than your regular street shoe as New Balance runs small. Good luck!"
292981,1,Always scary to buy shoes online but My husband loved them. The fit was perfect and couldnt believe the quickness of receiving them - 1day!! They are soft and not stiff.
260085,1,"Bought as a gift for my son. They were true to fit size, comfortable and a very good price."
247677,1,My second pair my old ones are 5 yrs. old. But they are still good just have paint on them and some weather cracking and I will keep for old work boots so I don't get paint on my new ones.
342458,1,"I just took a second job in which I will be on my feet all day, but still have to dress in business attire. I have had them only a few days and am wearing them for the second time. They are so comfortable. I could wear them 24/7 and never get uncomfortable they way I do in most other shoes. They are true to size and so nicely made. Will definitely look for David Tate shoes in the future."
162546,0,The shoe is awesome -- but had to return twice -- wear a size smaller in this shoe than I really wear!
267533,1,"I've worn my previous pair for hiking in California and the Swiss Alps, in rain and shine, and my only complaint is that I would have liked a more rigid sole for the rougher terrain. Other than that i can't fault the comfort or durability. I got the second pair because although the first has lots of life left, I would hate to have to look around for something this good at this good a price again!"
327433,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
164075,1,The shoes arrived very quickly and the correct size. They are very comfortable despite being taller of a heel than I expected.
321778,1,"My 80 year old mother loves these shoes. The older she gets, the harder it becomes to get something comfortable. I just bought her a second pair."
82229,1,"Shoes arrived extremely late. Quality is terrific, though. Aerosoles are great walking shoes."
293834,1,"Excellent shoes for bouldering or sport routes, I've just ordered my second pair after getting a full season's worth of outdoor and gym climbing in on them. The heel pocket is very snug, I've never had the dagrons slip off on me while popping a heel hook. Sizing is pretty much consistent with your street shoe size, which I always found a bit odd as other five ten shoes I've had I've had to size down 1-1.5 sizes from street shoes."
52348,1,These do promote a more stable stride especially on slick surfaces. I only buy Propet for walking shoes. They are quality made. My only disappointment was the sizing. They run wider in the heel and toe than other shoes I've purchased from them in the same size.
58848,1,"This was the perfect size, I ordered the large and had to send it back because it was too big."
17977,0,I liked the shoe because of it's support to my ankles but it doesn't do to much if you have flat feet.
15678,1,They are nice shoes. I would buy them again. The quality and style is good. They have a nice selection of colors.
151973,1,"I cant give a detailed review of the shoe itself, because I never received my order. I ordered a pair thru Amazon, and the seller was ShoeMall. Within a few days, my order was canceled because the shoe was no longer available. I have had another experience similar to this with ShoeMall.To comment on the shoe itself, I tried a pair of Traveltime sneakers on in a store, at the end of a long shopping day. My aching feet felt like they were walking on pillows! I couldn't believe how comfortable they were. I didnt purchase any at that time but wish I had!!"
218336,1,"I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
232176,1,I received a quality pair of Adidas Samba Classics at an unbelievable price. They were delivered on time during the Christmas season. I couldn't be happier.
369569,1,"These shoes are great for skating, the soles of the shoe have a nice flat bottom with thick rubber that gives a solid feel on the deck of the skateboard with padding on the inside. I skate ditches a few times a week and can usually get a few months out of a pair of these shoes before wearing holes in the soles of the shoes."
119675,1,product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
369071,1,"Really love the quality of these flip-flops and how comfy they are. I can basically wear one pair for several years, throw them in the wash every now and then, and they still hold up. Definitely recommend these over Tevas."
292789,1,The color is amazing! If you wear any Brown Tees this is the must have shoe!
58616,1,"Keds have always been good sneakers. These seem to have lived up to that. Since they are white, they did not wash well but I discovered if you dry them in the dryer, the streaks that show up when you air dry them disappear."
30264,1,"My feet are important and the quality of shoes I get my feet on are important too that's why I choose Vaneli shoes, specially for the office, I wear them at least 9 hours a day that's why I have these particular style in many colors. They are so comfortable and look very nice, the leather is so soft, they feel like gloves, true to the size, just make sure you order the right width. Nothing like Vaneli shoes!"
309510,1,These are THE most comfortable shoes with my plantar fascitis foot problem that I have recently aquired. I highly recommend them. I wish they were more durable for wearing at the beach et......
186339,1,I was looking for birkenstock because they are very supportive and comfortable whe you are on your feet as much as I am as a nurse.
114571,1,"These are a nice pair of leather ballet shoes. Although the size I ordered was still big for my daughter, even tho Ive read reviews to order one size up because they ran small. I found it to run almost true to size for my daughter."
108597,1,"One of the sexiest shoe on the entire Ellie range. These are very well made (superb craftmanship), and I definitely LOVE the adjustable buckle vamp ; it allows for a perfect fit of your toes and foot on the front. My only complaint is that the strap could have been a bit longer, it would have been a little more easy to use and adjust.A final personal advice : go for one size under your regular size, for with the adjustable front strap, you have plenty of room for your foot, and it looks definitly HOT and sexier ! Well, this my own personal preference and opinion !"

231150,1,Rainbow flip-flops are basically the best leather flip-flops you can buy. worth the price and the time required to break them in.
99942,1,"I am very pleased by how quickly the shoes came--it only took 2 days! I ordered the Sahara colored (leather) sperry's for my sister. And I'm very glad that I ordered 1/2 a size lower than her normal shoe size (as suggested by other sperry customers) because they have stretched out a bit. She said that when she first put them on, they were not as comfortable as she thought they would be. She did not get any blisters, but the heels of the shoe were definately uncomfortable for her. HOWEVER, since she has been wearing them everyday for almost two weeks,the heel stretched out and she says they feel great!"
239200,0,"I like these shoes for just slipping on to hang around or go run errands, but DO NOT buy these shoes for any kind of serious walking. The elastic around the ankle is not tight enough to keep your foot well located. Particularly on downhill stretches, my toes bunched up into the front of the shoes. I ended up with blisters as a result."
25609,1,"Kinda impossible to go wrong with Kiwi Brown. It's been around forever and it just does what it's supposed to do. Definitely recommend. Great packaging design, too."
377427,0,"Purchased these for my BF as a gift based on, for the most part, great reviews. He is pretty big on wearing slippers around the house so I wanted something of good quality, comfortable and durable. During the winter months, he always wears socks with his slippers. So for his normal 10.5 size shoe, I purchased the 11 and they fit just right with his socks on. I can not comment on the durability, but they did seem to be of good quality and he said they were very comfy. Unfortunately, they are very noisy on hard surfaced floors. We have laminate flooring through most of the house and he sounded like he was wearing hard shoes when he walked around. They sounded uncomfortable and it got very annoying. Another issue he had with them was that the coloring from the suede part of the slippers, stained his socks. After about a week of wearing them he decided to return them. For as much as they cost, he shouldn't have to deal with those issues."
190506,1,"Just purchased my fourth pair of these shoes. Need I say more? Well, one thing: compared with other shoes I've owned, the waterproofing is excellent - and, guys, you know that when you need it, you really need it."
353814,1,"Best pair of work boots I have ever worn (2nd pair). Absolutely zero break in pain or discomfort.You cannot go wrong with these, you will go wrong IF you do not!!!!"
322320,1,"This is my first time owning Rockport shoes but I am extremely satisfied. They are comfortable, look great, easy to wear. I'll see how they hold up after 6 months but I love these shoes"
386599,1,Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine for that long. I've skated them for that long too. Super comfortable when they're broken in and will last you for years. Vans for life.
24290,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
257751,1,"I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered a larger size than I thought I would need. I normally wear size 12, but after reading the reviews that all said they run small I ordered the largest size available at the time which was 13 W. I would have ordered a 14 but it wasn't available at the time. 14 would have been perfect but these will do. ORDER LARGER THAN YOU THINK YOU NEED."
309360,1,I would like to have been able to wear the shoe. It was too little and was not what I wanted. I would recommend it for other to try however
253024,1,"I started wearing Clarks desert boot in suede, crepe sole since 1979 and sometimes they are out of stock in local Clarks boutique, and from now on, I can order from Amazon. I always get 2 pairs at one time so I can wear them alternately to let the suede to restore its shape. Thanks to Clarks and Amazon. Some more information to share, if you find the sole is wearing out and you start feeling the hard rough surface of road, put a liner that has a thin pad into the shoe and you can go on with the boot for couple more months. The boot holds uneven ground well but can be very slippery on SMOOTH WET floor. Be careful"
52667,1,"These shoes are great. Stability when walking. Size/fit are true. I would recommend these shoes for all walkers, but especially for those like me, a senior citizen whose daily exercise is mainly walking. I had purchased a white pair last year and was very pleased with them so I bought these black ones to wear in the winter."
297683,1,"This is a fun shoe to wear for intermediate exercise such as Pilates. It is comfortable, provides cushioning like a gym shoe and is much more stylish than a regular gym shoe. I also wear them when I want a dressier shoe, but am going to be on my feet for awhile."
26666,0,"I bought these as character shoes for opera performance. They are very uncomfortable for now and I cannot wear them more than an hour without swearing, but all the singers I work with tell me that once you wear them for a while, they become very comfortable..."
199643,1,"This is my second pair of Earth Lazers. They are wonderful walking shoes. I use them for work and exercise. Very comfortable, lightweight and flexible. I wore them on a trip to Europe and my feet never hurt after doing much walking."
27542,0,"Shoe is a bit narrow. The heel is higher than I wanted-2"". Could use more padding in the ball of shoe, which is where you put your weight when your dancing. I'm a beginner dancer and the leather sole is slippery even after using sand paper to rough it up. (I found a suede sole to be less slippery for a beginner.)"
285933,0,"I wear a size 8.5 and one reviewer wrote to order a size SMALLER. I ordered size 8 and the boots are too small to wear with socks. If I wear thin socks they end up bunching up at the bottom of my feet within a few minutes which is very annoying and uncomfortable. I didn't return them, hoping they would adjust to my feet after a while, but they never did. For the money I paid, I am disappointed that these are not ""the most comfortable boots"" as previously reviewed. I recommend you order your true size to get the best fit."
172396,1,"I purchased a pair of these early last summer based on a recommendation. They are extremely comfortable and cool -- comfortable enough that I've worn them nearly every day (that there wasn't actually snow on the ground) since. A year later they have a lot more give and some of the leather is beginning to fray. I purchased a second pair and keep the first as my ""backyard"" sandals."
174646,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
191373,1,"I have another pair of these shoes and loved them; therefore, I purchased the pair through Amazon at a good price."
91727,1,"Look sharp at the gym. Kind of squeeky when wet. I throw them in the washing machine to clean them. I liked them enough to give a pair away as a gift ...j.g. Staten Island, NY"
353471,1,"these boots are lightweight and incredibly comfortable! i haven;t challenged the water resistance or insulation to extremes but have found them to hold up well in heavy rain and temps to the mid 20's. the padded tongue and collar and padded insole are more comfy than any other brand i have tried recently. as always, i was able to find a deal on amazon and got them about 30 dollars cheaper than any shoe website or store in my area. if you're on your feet alot at work or just want a comfy boot to kick around in...these is well worth your money!"
386293,1,Purchased these for a family member. They really like them! She says the shoes are extremely comfortable! I purchased this model of shoe due to the great reviews by others who purchased them.
205900,1,"I see so many people perplexed about what size to order in the Havaianas. I went to their website to figure it out. You are ordering a flip flop based on Brazilian sizing that is stamped with a USA MEN'S SIZE equivalent. For example, size 39/40 is a USA MENS size 7/8. If you are a woman, you need to convert that USA MENS size into a woman's size...basically, you'll add 2 to the USA MENS number. For example, the men's size 7/8 would convert to a woman's size 9/10.I purchased Brazilian size 39/40 for myself. That is a men's size 7/8 and stamped so on the flip flop. I wear a USA woman's size 9 and the flip flop fits perfectly.I purchased Brazilian size 37/38 for my step daughter. That is a men's size 5/6 and stamped so on the flip flop. She wears a USA woman's size 7.5 and the flip flop fits perfectly."
352184,1,I love these sandals!! I am not one to wear flats EVER but I needed a pair of brown sandals that I would be able to walk longer distances in. These are fashionable . . .I wear them with capris and long skirts . . . AND comfortable.
210307,1,I bought these shoes for my 22-year-old daughter -- she loves them. They are VERY tall but she says they are comfortable!
247890,1,Are there larger sizes?? I would like a mens size 12 please. It is a christmas present so please hurry.
244114,1,"If you know Bostonian shoes then you will know that Amazon.com offers some great prices for them. If you don't know Bostonian brand shoes then I can tell you that they are well made, stylish (office) shoes that represent reasonable value for money."
282198,1,"These are great shoes! I've worn Clarks for many years, and have nothing bad to say about them. Desert Trex is a favorite."
338106,1,Sneakers were a gift for son-in-law. That's the kind he likes. He's happy.
225450,2,"These shoes look great. They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays. The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet. The soles are too flat. When I tried running in them, my heels began to hurt. Walking wise, they aren't the most comfortable to say the least. They are also heavy for what they are. Too expensive for what they are. These shoes are probably bad for your back because they don't absorb any impact. Personally, I don't recommend them for anyone."
338551,1,"I had to buy several Converse All-Star shoes for my newly formed basketball league. The wife recommended buying them at the German retail giant Kohl's. She wanted to use the 30% off coupon. But for some reason them Germans don't want to carry the in-between shoe sizes for those rare instances of humans that fit somewhere in the middle of 10 and 11.Thanks to the a seller on the Amazon Marketplace, I was able to get a pair at a comparable price that was shipped merely a day later after ordering! Yay to my new league getting to finally play their first game!"
255277,1,"I have wide, hot feet. These shoes, with their perforation, are much cooler than regular tennies, which I have tons of. Now it seems I only wear these Pony's. Surprisingly, although they don't look like it, are very supportive because of the strategic canvas bands. The only reason I give 4 is because the sole tends to be slippery when you least expect it...i.e. on a waxed floor....Otherwise the sole is very grippy."
71464,0,"I have worn these Moccasins for years. I love them so much that I buy a back-up pair incase something happens to the pair I am wearing. The problem with the last time I did this is that, by the time I needed the new pair, the return time ran out. This pair is cut so narrow that they rub blisters. I have never had this happen before. I am now stuck with a pair I cannot wear. I read that they are now made outside of this country and that is probably what created the problem. There is nothing better than American made the way it used to be. Now, not so much. If you purchase them as back-up, try them on while you can still send them back if they don't fit. I knew better and could kick myself for not trying them on. When they consistantly fit, it is an expensive mistake when they don't."
188362,1,"I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells. When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to). Most of their shoes need no ""break in"" time. I own the Yeti slides, they are so warm and comfortable. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years. The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret. You know, you're walking in heaven."
54366,0,Not as red as pictured. Overall I'm ok with the item but keep in mind that the colors are not as vibrant as pictured.
124608,1,"I had been looking for a pair of pink tennis shoes. Online I found the color that I wanted, I'm very pleased."
188500,1,"I am on my second pair of these boots, and I absolutely love them. The look great, and they are very comfortable for dialy wear. That is why I gave them 5 stars.If you are looking for a pair of hiking boots, these are NOT what you want. I give them zero stars for hiking. I recently wore these with gel inserts on a 9 mile hike in the Shenandoah National Park and my feet hurt so bad I wanted to die. Needless to say, I will be shopping for a pair of actual hiking shoes now, but when these wear out, I will definately buy another pair for casual wear."
300898,1,"I really like these shoes, wearing very comfortable, is slightly larger than the normal code point, but does not affect the wearing comfort."
87983,0,I measured my daughters foot and ordered the correct size for her however the shoes were way too small. The entire shoe was smaller than my daughter's bare foot! I would say to order at least a size bigger.
56674,1,These shoes have always been my favorite standby for summer. They have been around for years and I always have a pair or two in my closet.
146880,0,"I have a pair of UGGS that are over 16 years old. They were made in New Zealand and of higher quality. Now UGGS are made in China and it shows/feels. After verifying authenticity and trying on my boots...they feel so flimsy, but what can one do?My old pair finally started to wear out on the inside behind the heel. They are still ok with a double pair of socks, but I wanted a taller pair of boots. The toes on my old boots are reinforced with another strip of suede. It feels really strange putting on my new ones as they don't have that reinforcement and feels like it will wear out over time in the toes.Hopefully I will be proved wrong."
331446,0,"I purchased one pair for my mum a few months ago, those were made in Italy and they're great! So I ordered a econd pair, just got them and they're made in Mexico and are like the Italy ones, this are mush smales (even they're the same size) and les wider. Wish I had know this before and I would have not purchased them......"
151032,1,"I just keep buying this model year after year, they are perfect tennis shoes, very comfortable, great quality, I still have a pair from 5 years ago. Very good for training, running, nothing fancy. just perfecct."
333861,1,I love them there everything i remember the shoe to be.style and comfort what else could one want.
332532,1,I've had these shoe before and can honestly say they are more comfortable than dress shoes that cost $150-$200 so they are a nice dress or causal shoe for the money
190395,1,"My son needed a pair of white tennis shoes for his casual choir outfit. After looking in every store around and online I was so happy to find these. I hated the idea of spending money on a pair of ugly solid white shoes that he wouldn't wear outside of choir and these are perfect. They are exactly what we were looking for and they are so good looking. He's completely happy with them, they fit well and they don't look like shoes his grandpa would wear. Love K-Swiss!"
275542,1,"I've worn my previous pair for hiking in California and the Swiss Alps, in rain and shine, and my only complaint is that I would have liked a more rigid sole for the rougher terrain. Other than that i can't fault the comfort or durability. I got the second pair because although the first has lots of life left, I would hate to have to look around for something this good at this good a price again!"
156769,1,I just love these slippers and give them to all the man in my family as gifts.
145494,1,I brought the uggs for my birthday. They look great and are true to size. I brought black this time so i can wear these more often.
312890,1,"This footwear is great for walking the treadmill. If I was buying training shoes I'd be paying about six to seven times the amount as I did for these. Now, normally I take a size 10/6x so new balance is about the only brand I can get with a fit. Well, I bought the crocs at $15 a pair because not too many peeps want a red xxlarge. I also have a high arch and walk on the outside of my foot. I needed to take a pocket knife to the inner side of the clog to make room for my width. The high arch and and wide foot is the reason I went with the xxlarge. Since I don't run on the treadmill (I walk briskly) these are most comfortable and ideal. The price was so low that I bought three pair. If I didn't need to modify them a bit with my knife I'd give them five stars for my needs."
189935,1,I've bought my daughter probably 5 pairs of these shoes over the years and she loves them. This is the cheapest I've ever paid so that made it that much better.
216942,2,I ordered these shoes a week and a half ago and still have not recieved them. I don't know how much longer I am going to have to wait. Your really better off buying them at your nearest retailer of shoes and if they dont have them ask them to order them for you. This is ridiculous. If your expecting a speedy delievery under a week this product may not be for you.
7365,1,Like this shoe. It's my third pair. Recommend it for comfort and support. HFC Why are you requiring me to say 6 more words?
330165,1,This is my 2nd pair of Betula Birk's. I had to replace my last pair due to an aggressive chewer (puppy). Summer is not bearable to me without these sandals. I love the 3 straps. I always want the 3 straps as it makes the shoe less likely to ever slip out from under you.
376762,1,"use ONLY these shoes to work in-- i own a child care business so i'm on my feet alot plus need the added support & other benefits of the stability walker-- like most propet products (i've got a number of different styles), they all enable orthotics to be used with or without at least one of the 2 insoles that come with their shoes.... get a size large enuff to accommodate your orthotic PLUS the shock absorber insole; just remove the liner insole that has no support, etc to it and you'll be alot happier! without the shock absorber insole.... well.... it's NOT fun! also, LOTS of toe room-- i went up from a 7 1/2 reg width to an 8 wide width (also use athletic socks) and it's perfect!"
63754,2,I purchased a pair size 7 1/2. The ones I received were labeled 7 1/2 but were at least 8 1/2 shoes. These shoes are very narrow.
96434,1,"Walking shoes arrived timely and in good shape. Compared to the cross trainer's of the exact same size, they are less comfortable and tighter on my foot (size 2E)"
333298,0,What about those of us that have smaller feet? This is the first I have seen that there are no size6?? I would love to buy these but a 7 is too big!
130987,0,"I ordered based on the size - 39 is US 8. Well, the shoe is at least 2-3 inches too large, and 1-2 inches too wide. I do have slightly wide feet but these are really wide. I'm not sure who said it ran small but I would need maybe a 37 - 38 in this shoe."
12306,1,"They were a last minute Christmas gift. They came so quickly, the size was normal, the color fun, he loved them."
323959,1,"I am anywhere from a size 8 to 9.5 in U.S. Men's shoes. I initially ordered a medium, but changed my mind to a small (and Amazon customer service was very obliging in helping me with this). I'm glad I did because small was the correct choice. The split toe fills the shoe nicely and allows for some length adjustment. I much prefer the Woodlore shoe tree over a couple Jos. A Banks shoe trees I have that don't have the split toe and instead work on a spring system, which is currently rather rigid and difficult to maneuver. I can get this shoe tree in and out with total ease."
355890,1,"I'm on my fifth day of wearing them.. They are just now starting to break in and they are becoming even more comfortable. They don't seem to be clarks best quality by any means.. but for the price, you can't beat it."
7518,1,"Excellent shoes, very confortable and they look good. Exactly what you would expect from clarks. Would recomend them to anyone looking for a light and confortable everyday shoe."
199928,0,"This shoe is cute, but not comfortable. You need to order a size larger than usual. It is chunkier than I thought, but I couldn't beat it for the price."
238484,1,"This is a gorgeous shoe and extremely comfortable. Anne Klein style is evident--it's a very luxe-looking shoe. Fantastic bargain and they run true to size.Update 2nd season (18 mos after purchase): the very filmy plastic-like material covering the heels of these shoes has started to peel away, starting at the sole of the heel. I have given them some fairly regular use, but I would not have anticipated this as the leather uppers still look beautiful--nearly new! Truly tragic :(I realize there may not even be any of these left on the market, but the info may be an indicator of the quality of other shoes by the same maker."
304388,1,"I can't find a single thing to complain about with these shoes. They're comfortable, flexible, lightweight, and stylish. The sole provides a lot of grip (I don't play soccer in them but the floors at my work are often wet and I don't slip and fall). You can get the classic kind or the originals kind (only difference I can tell is the length of the tongue, I have no preference). The laces that came with mine are the perfect length, the shoes fit like a glove. Many say they run small, but I do believe they have wide feet, because the Sambas have a sort of average or almost narrow design. Either way they fit me perfect when I ordered my normal size. These shoes last a long time, I have owned a few pairs now. I wear them until they die which is everyday for about a year. They have many different colors to choose from, but they all look good. They can be casual shoes or dressed up just a tad (they're athletic shoes, not dress shoes) but they look good with jeans or shorts. Overall great shoes, Amazon has a great price for them. I highly recommend them!"
263641,1,This is a xmas gift for my husband...They came quickly and are perfect. They were the best price(46$) and I am very happy with my purchase.
196398,1,"UPDATE!! Though I didn't get what I originally purchased, Extreme Footwear was wonderful in that they rushed the correct pair to me. Since they were an outside vendor Amazon couldn't ship me the correct pair they could only do the return. Extreme Footwear took the iniciative do to that for me and I am a happy customer. The shoes are exactly what we hoped for. More importantly, My son is happy!"
200556,1,"I've been a Top-Siders fan for years. The shoe does have an excellent grip on wet surfaces. The look is also great and they are comfortable. The price on this purchase came in less than other sites, arrived on time and in good condition. Overall, a great buying experience."
143473,1,"No surprises here - I always love this series of Dan Post boots... and they're beautiful and comfortable, as usual."
210753,1,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
111340,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
95618,2,"I purchased the shoes in June and I had to buy a new pair of work shoes already and it's only October. The shoes were a real dissapointment. They were no better than shoes from Payless shoes. Do not recomment at all.I am a waitress an on my feet all day, so I was expecting better from nurse mates."
184923,1,"I recently bought 2 pairs of Nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat.I received 2 pairs of nellie Chukka Timerlands in colour Wheat White.when requesting the colour on the order form, you have 2 options for wheat. The option for Wheat White is not separate from regular wheat.I am now stuck with 2 pairs of the wrong colour. I live in Ireland and therefore would be very expensive for me to send them back to you.I am very dissapointed with my purchases. Unless you can rectify the situation for me I will not be recommending your service to family and friends.Thanking youRachel Costello"
32078,1,"I am a restaurant manager and I believe that I should receive danger pay due to the fact that the shoes I have to wear to stay stylish are usually extremely uncomfortable. Not with these! Though they boast a substantial heel, they are comfortable enough for a 8-10 hour shift. I never stop moving at work and these help me every step of the way. Great craftsmanship and an excellent price point as well!! Wish they came in more colors- a nude and a brown would be instant additions to my wardrobe."
201565,1,"Excellent service! Before you click anywhere else, check out theprice and service here!"
369530,1,They feel comfortable and true to size. The black and white go with everything. I'll be buying this same pair again.
49125,1,"These arrived shiny and clean. A pair of heavy socks and throw in some insoles and I was in the ""comfort Zone"". the 4 stars instead of five is because the metal lace eyelets pop out occasionally. But, for a 20 dollar boot I see no other problems..."
89548,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
135921,1,Exactly the same as what I was expecting. Size and color was perfect. It is nice to wear with skinny jeans.
49575,0,"I liked the boots, they fit comfortably. However after wearing them a few tims one of the lace hooks broke loose. Still wearable though, and I enjoy my boots alot."
201145,0,I purchased these off Amazon for $54 a couple years ago. After a year and a half of shopfloor walking the insides had worn off and the steel plate started rubbing my toes and ruining socks. Still look good though.
185751,1,I'm here to buy another pair. These were comfortable from the first time I put them on. I wear them all the time and these were my primary pair of shoes while traveling to several countries recently. Never once did my feet hurt (and that's rare indeed when walking on precarious surfaces for long periods of time). I wish they offered even more options like a black swede. But definitely worth it!!!!
4734,1,"With proper care, these boots are nearly indestructible. Comfortable, easy to break in, with soles that barely seem to wear down--even after years of walking all over the earth."
109578,1,"...I've been wearing Chuck Taylor's (both in low and hi tops) for well over 30 years now. I remember when they were far, far cheaper than they are today, and the mainstay colors were much easier to find (i.e., black, gray, canvas, blue and red), but I don't intend for this to be one of those ""in my day, you could go out to dinner and movie for a nickel"" type of reviews.The bottom line - these are great, comfortable shoes. I usually wear mine as they were originally intended - for use in the gym. Specifically, these are excellent, economical shoes to wear when doing certain weight-lifting/body-building routines such as deadlifts, squats and overhead presses (among the majority of my routines). Perhaps the next best thing to doing those routines bare-footed (outside of the much more expensive Vibram Five Fingers KSO - Men's). Particularly when used only in the gym, these shoes last forever. Even when they are worn daily, out and about, they still hold up amazingly well. An absolute favorite of mine.Highly recommended."
256653,1,These boots are the best women's boot I have found! I have owned 3 pair over the last 6 years.I believe they may run a bit big (my feet could be shrinking). I usually were a 8 in most sneakers and shoes. I have worn both the 8 and 7.5 in these. The 8 provide a bit more room for heavy socks.I am a merchant mariner and spend endless hours on my feet and unforgiving steel decks. These boots are very comfortable with the dura shock souls. The anti slip souls are amazing and have saved me from slipping on deck many times.I usually treat the leather and then put waterproofing spray on them. It helps but they aren't waterproof if you step in a puddle of course. After sweating or getting wet the leather color will come off onto your sock.I highly recommend these boots!
231555,1,This Teva sandal is great. It is so comfortable that you don't know you're even wearing it. It looks super with all sorts of clothes - casual to dressy.
166863,1,"I have been chasing grouse, pheasant and quail (when we used to have them) all over Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and South Dakota for 30 years. I have had numerous boots over the years, Red Wing, Cabela's Kangaroo, Rocky, Irish Setter,etc. I have had some good ones but nothing compares to this Danner boot. I wanted something that wouldn't take long to break in and I preferred something made in America. I got both with this boot. They felt like a 10 year old boot the first time I wore them .... that's a good thing. Pretty pricey but I don't jack around when it comes to my feet."
12073,1,"I have been a fan of Converse since the day I saw Will Smith unpack a brand new pair in the movie iRobot. I wanted one for myself, where else amazon is the best place to buy. The Product price is very affordable except the shipping and handling costs. They are a bit high to Sri Lanka. Would be great if they are low too."
102719,1,Bought this through amazon. Love this shoe . bought a taupe and a black pair. They have good arch support and can wear with dress or slacks..
4511,0,"I purchased these on the basis the description stated they were waterproof. After 5 minutes walking in wet grass, my feet were soaking wet. On the other hand, these boots are extremely comfortable - when dry. If your looking for nice pair of hiking boots, under dry conditions, these are a great choice. Wet = 1 star, Dry = 5 stars, Overall = 3 stars."
6676,1,This is a fantastic touch up for your car interior. Be sure to combine it with the deglaser to make sure the application works most successfully. This made my near pristine classic look tremendous.
187865,1,"These thick wool insoles are the best thing to come by this winter.I put them in my loose slippers and my feet are 10 times warmer which makes me warmer. I also got a pair for my mud boots. Just call me toastie toes! Finally! These are nice and thick, not whimpy."
300277,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
35620,1,"These shoes are comfortable. I took a chance they would work, lucked out, great fit, look cute too. I wear them during the warmer months."
192014,0,"I got my Sanuk Vagabonds at a clearance store for $20. Having been told about them in near-legendary terms, I absolutely had to try them. They're extremely comfortable, possibly moreso than any other footwear I've had other than feyue shoes. Unfortunately, after 2 months of wearing them like I'd expect to wear any kind of sandals, the ball of my foot began to hurt. I took it off and noticed there was a big nasty bruise right on the ball of my foot. On the sandal, it had worn through more in just that spot than anywhere else. There's streaks of white showing in various spots on the shoes (sandals).I'm mitigating the issue by inserting a pair of Birkenstock insoles from a pair of clogs I used to wear. It's extended the life, but I have NO idea how anyone can get the 2-3 years they claim they get out of these unless they're wearing them for one day a week."
171541,1,"The handbag is very nice, very well made, looks good but it is a bit larger than the dimensions."
257530,1,I bought these shoes about last year for $29+ and this month I purchased 3 pairs of my size at $9.99 each. WOW What a Steal!!!!!
155301,1,Have tried many other boots but keep coming back to these. You cant beat the comfort for the price and they are always available when I need a new pair.
337532,1,"We bought these for our 5 year old but our 4 year old wanted the Merrell Chameleon in Wineberry. I have to say the Merrells look more comfortable as they're not as stiff, have a padded tongue, and fuller padding around the ankle. That all being said, the 5 year old loves these... because they're pink. The laces are difficult to tie as they are so slippery and tend to loosen up before you can get a good bow tied, especially for a young one just learning to tie. They are competent boots, which were hard to find for little girls. We used them on short hikes in a state park and they performed acceptably. Cannot comment on their waterproofness as we did not tromp through any water. If you have a little princess with her heart set on pink and a need for waffle-stompers, these will work."
61972,1,"These are my second pair of Hi Tec Altitude hiking boots, and they are even better than the first pair. Better quality, better fit, better style, etc. I found a USED pair in my size at Amazon for half the regular price, so I bought them. There is nothing to show they were used. They are like new. Great deal!"
39314,0,"I bought these for my husband after a lot of searching for hikers. He found them comfortable for shorter periods of time. They're weren't an ""all day"" wear shoe."
290872,0,"I ordered these boots because they say they are 12"" but they are really 10"". They are also made from thin leather."
223828,1,Bought these for my husband. He prefers hi-tops but this was better than he expected. He does prefer hi-tops for ankle support.
304612,1,I bought this pair of shoes not for soccer but for everyday use. It's quite comfortable and stylish. Pretty good for its price.
271730,1,"heavy duty durable boots , love the way they handle on my bike and there not rely heavy in wight ,and seriously they look good"
377314,1,"I absolutely love Danner boots! This is my third pair in eight years and I am not easy on them! I am a State Trooper and my boots are a very important part of my uniform. They must be tough, comfortable, long lasting, and able to shine up like a new penny! These boots fit the bill in every area. Best of all, Amazon was $70 cheaper than every other place on the Internet....plus the shipping is free! When you ship them to rural Alaska, that is a BIG deal! Thank you Amazon for offering high quality products at great prices!"
80861,1,"The shoes are great, and the shipping time was reasonable, as was the price. A warning: not all types can be shipped to Canada, which is frustrating to find out just as you're finishing up an order."
90065,0,"Ordered a size 10, received a size 10. In actuality, they are at least a size 12 or 13. Way too large but not expensive enough to bother with sending back."
4767,1,"I absolutely love this shoe! They are soo comfortable and look great on. I have flat feet so I have a hard time finding running shoes that fit me, infact I havent bought a pair of running shoes in almost 3 years because I havent found any that fit right. I tried this brand on at a department store and loved them, but not the price. So when I found these on amazon I had to have them and am sooo glad that I did!!! Recommend them to anyone and everyone!!!"
104044,1,"love the Birkenstock brand. This style I wear a 38 and this style runs 1/2 size too big, even with thick socks. A little disappointing."
272870,1,"I've read other reviews of this shoe and they haven't been good. So I bought a pair.The shoes fit fine. They're comfortable and hold your foot. They're true to size and are supported by a kind of double strap around the ankle. If you like thin straps, don't buy them. You won't like the look. However, I found them appealingly comfortable, snug and attractive. Didn't miss the conventional vertical strap on the side at the ankle. The double strap compensates for this. They'll take a little time to work in. I wore them all day and the only issue I had was the vertical strap in the back of the foot. It dug in a little after eight hours of wear."
332548,0,"I got this at my overseas address in 48 hours! wow. It is well priced. These are lightweight and very comfortable shoes. However, the front side changed its shape after a couple of months."
172914,1,Not many shoe companies bother to make different widths. That's amazing considering that millions live in this country alone and they can't all have the same feet width. The extra width means I no longer get corns and blisters. Plus the show is very good. I'm stuck on New Balance.
165408,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
246675,1,"I bought two pairs of these shoes, black croc and brown croc. They are so comfortable and I wear them so much that the black ones are nearly worn out and I will order another pair soon."
73024,1,"Granted, at first glance one may not be too impressed with the looks of these shoes. I was one of these people. However, on a trip to Maine, I needed a pair of shoes that would serve well on land as well as in the water on trails and on the oceans. That being said, I discovered the true toughness and comfort of these shoes. I even hiked up a 3,000 foot mountain in these things and they still exhibit modest wear on the soles and around the entire shoe. This was extremely rocky and rugged terrain to boot and would not advise this as the primary terrain to tackle with Crocs.SIZINGI am a true 10.5 in mens. However, 10 was definitely too small and uncomfortable for me, so I bought size 11 since there are no half sizes. From this discovery, it is safe to say that Crocs are pretty true to size. 11s are a little big on me, but the strap still locks my foot in place and it does not feel like my foot is coming out of the shoe if I am not using the strap. The foam material Crocs are made from grips your feet pretty well, even when wet or sweaty.COMFORTThere are not many shoes, even shoes I've spent over $100, that can match Crocs in comfort. I could wear these shoes all day and my feet would not hurt or blister while on the trails. On a regular day out, same story. For summer, they are great because air is constantly able to flow through and cool your feet. When they get wet, I mean completely soaked, they usually will dry off within about 5 minutes.STYLEThese are really not as ugly as people think. Once you wear them and get them on, they really start to grow on you both on how they look and how they feel. People who say they hate these shoes are those who have never put a pair on and worn them (I was one of these people). As far as colors go, white and lighter colors seem like they will definitely get dirty easily. I have black and they are easy to clean of, just a rinse and rub down with a rag.The main thing is people just have to have an open mind when purchasing this style of footwear. They are a little unorthodox but they are high quality, functional, and as bad looking as people think. They are so easy just to slip on and they are featherweight and easy to walk in. I use them a lot for just getting the mail or going to the gym before I put my gym shoes on. I have been pleasently surprised with Crocs' resilience and highly recommend these bad boys."
302306,1,It's a Chuck Taylor through and through. Not much support but I don't care. These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway. So we just dropped it in and he was good to go. He wore these with his tux for the prom. He was stylin' and comfortable. I do recommend going up 1/2 size if you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short.
183251,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
331495,2,I ordered my daughter the orange Crocs for her birthday. They arrived in two days in time for her to open for her big day. They broke within an hour of wearing. I am so disappointed. I have to find out how and if I can return them. What a hassle!
309294,0,I was hoping that the charcoal would be a little darker. But it was not. I will keep them but now I know that when it say charcoal it means a light gray not a dark gray.
276566,0,I have had several pairs of these boots over the years and liked them. The most recent pair had a manufacturing defect that was biting thre inside of my left ankle. I had to lace them so loose that the support was inadequate. I guess with Chinese children making boots you can't expect perfection.
261278,1,I bought these for a gift. The recipient loved them. Apparently it is hard to find the half sizes in stores with this shoe. No complaints with these.
35889,1,"These shoes are way hip and since they're hightops, my kid can't kick them off in the carseat! I haven't heard any complaints about comfort from him either. They have held up through two sons and are a little faded from frequent washing, but look all the cooler for it."
46116,1,Very cute flat shoe. If your feet tend to swell however I would order a wide width. Other than that the shoe looks great with jeans or capri pants!
376059,0,"These shoes were for my wife, and I can only tell you what she tells me. She spends 14 hours a day in them as she works at the local hospital, and she's always on her feet, so she needs well made shoes.They are good shoes, and offer good support, BUT the sole liner ALWAYS come out, or shifts it's position in these shoes. These are the third pair she's owned of this brand and style, and this has happened to all of them. Obviously, a design flaw. And, this third pair does pinch in the toe area, even though they are wide.Good shoes, but not the best. She is looking for something better."
327081,1,"These flips are the best! Comfy and cute! Plus, if they get dirty I just throw them in the washer!"
271284,1,"I ordered the timberland Boat Shoes from Amazon. I like to moccassins in the house, slipping them off for out door shoes. These were exactly as described and pictured, Fit just right and have the thick soles I like.Often the size is not exact [or at least doesn't conform to other shoe vendors sizes) but these shoes fit as do most other shoe orders I have placed. These required no ""break-in"" as some moccassins do.Just as important to me is the shape of the shoe and quality of the shoe materials. Just what I expected from the listing"
285403,0,"got this shoes because of the reviews that i read regarding how comfy it is. well, its comfy!"
86558,1,"I have always been reluctant to buy shoes on-line but I decided to give it a try. Thanks to all of you wonderful Amazon customers who took the time to describe your experience and give your honest feedback! I have a very high arch and instep and many shoes will not fit over my foot. Also, in some shoes I wear one size and in some another size. I took a chance and bought what is usually my ""regular size"". They fit perfectly. With the adjustable straps, my instep problems are solved. But most of all, when I put them on the first time, my instant response was ""Ahhhhhhh"" - they are so very comfortable right out of the box. No ""breaking in"" at all. They have become by favorite summer shoes and while some sandals are only for casual wear, these are nice enough to wear anywhere. Delivery was on time as advertised and they even included easy return instructions and pre-paid return label. Fortunately, I didn't have to use it."
250576,1,"The men's New Balance 574 has been around for many years. It's a 'retro' style in that it's based on an older style and comes in MANY different color combinations for the fashion-forward thinkers out there. They look vastly different than the current crop of 'minamalist' running shoes every shoe manufacturer is producing.Fashion aside, the New Balance 574 is actually a pretty decent running shoe. I've had them before many times over and they fit the shape of my foot perfectly. I do, in fact, use them for actual running. I put about 5-10 miles a week on them and they are durable, supportive, and well-cushioned. They are, however, based on 'old-shoe' technology and I've added Superfeet green insoles now that I've gotten older(see my review here on Superfeet for more information).In all fairness, most running shoes - even the high-dollar, current crop -have very poor insoles in them from the factory. The reason I've been told is because there's little 'shelf-appeal' with an insole! The only shoe I've found lately that doesn't need any help is the New Balance 990-series. Those shoes, however, are now in the $140-150 range and out of my budget.Try on a New Balance 574 the next time you're in a shoe store. Yeah... they may be marketed as a 'fashion' shoe now, but they are actual RUNNING shoes from a day when running shoes were meant to do one thing well - perform!Jae"
342246,1,"Love the look of these shoes - a stylish stand out. As usual I bought a half-size bigger (a nine to my normal 8.5). It's a narrow shoe and fits snugly, and I got blisters on my instep during my first 10 miler. Having run 50+ road miles on them, they're broken in and are now quite comfy. I expected a softer landing with more bounce (maybe I'll try the Megabounce next time?), but overall I'm pleased with the Gigardide. They look cool enough to wear with jeans and should be great for trampling through airports and malls."
85107,1,I like it very much. It is so comfortable. I'd like to wear it all the summer. The speed is very fast and the shoe just what I want
13299,1,My granddaughter asked for these at Christmas. She thinks they are awesome and can't wait to wear them to school in the new year.
100770,1,"The quality is exactly the same as the ones that we purchase at the dance school for almost a quarter of the price. My daughter has been using the Capezio line of Ballet Shoes ever since she started dance and we have found them to be very sturdy and long lasting. All my daughter cares about really is that they are cute, of course :)"
162243,0,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
276937,1,"I've worn my previous pair for hiking in California and the Swiss Alps, in rain and shine, and my only complaint is that I would have liked a more rigid sole for the rougher terrain. Other than that i can't fault the comfort or durability. I got the second pair because although the first has lots of life left, I would hate to have to look around for something this good at this good a price again!"
87987,0,"The ballet shoes are very nice, but not true to size. My granddaughter (age 4) wears a size 7, I ordered a 7.5 to give her room to grow, and they were too small! Some advice about the sizing would have been helpful. Now we have to send them back."
305700,1,I bought my first pair of Rockport Prowalkers in 1993 and wore them 1-2 days/week since then. I cannot believe how long they've lasted and how comfortable they are. The new pair are great.
145744,0,"I love UGG boots...this pair is my second. However, I am not happy with EastBay, the shipper. They shipped me the wrong product and then took three and a half weeks to send me the right product. I had to continuously email them about the status of the shipment...very annoying. I love the boots though...so soft and comfortable."
221177,2,"This company sells shoes made from the hides of animals; in fact, the majority of shoes they offer for sale through amazon are dead animal skins. If it looks and smells like an animals' hide, and, it comes from a company who sells shoes made from the skins of once living animals - I'm not buying it. A shoe marketed as ""vegan"" won't cause us to overlook the fact they sell products made from slaughtered animals."
250620,1,"I got these sneakers for my husband after months of searching in stores. New Balance must not make them too much anymore. Anyway, our entire family owned a pair at one point and we must say it is by far the most comfortable, lightweight sneakers we have ever worn. Considering the price and comfort it is an excellent deal."
235240,0,"I should have ordered this as a size 12 or 11 1/2 if available but I still likeed the shoe and still have them for around the house lounging around but not good for any strenuous sport because of snug because of size, not the shoe."
55075,1,I have worn Keds for over 50 years and I love them. The last pair I had had something different about the instep that wasn't as comfortable as usual but his pair is wonderful! I like them because they're not bulky like a lot of the sneakers out there now!
233122,1,"I've owned various colors of this shoe over the years. They are classic and comfortable. They feel a little tight when you first try them on, but they always stretch to fit your feet like a glove. Great shoe!"
305009,0,"No one wants to look like a soup sandwich and these work well at keeping my uniform shirt tucked tight. Occasionally they will come unfastened. Also, the adjustable buckle stabs me in the leg when I get in the car ....... and sometimes I like the pain."
15581,1,"I tried these boots on locally and ordered them here. I like the boots. My feet get cold so I like the 1000 grams of thinsulate. The soles are plenty hard and a little slick in my tree stand but that is not a big deal. These are definitely cold weather boots, not for hiking as much as they are for sitting on stand. They seem well build like all Danner's so I think they will hold up. I would buy them again!"
293048,1,"These shoes felt good on my feet right out of the box - no break in time required. The actual shoe looks just like the picture on line. They are lighter in weight than I expected, which I consider a plus. Build quality appears to be really good. Highly recommended."
295823,1,Yaktrax work great and are easy to put on. I don't feel so old now going hiking in the winter is easier.
204744,1,Love these flip flops. They are so comfortable. This is my second pair. I wear them about everyday during the spring and summer. These and the Reef Lounger are awesome. You don't want to ever take them off.. They are a must for the summer!!!
346173,0,"I purchased from the photo. was in a hurry that day. Glad they where the low ones he wanted. novelty item. My son wanted them , he is 30 yrs old. A fun item he used to have many years ago. the size recomendations was correct. 1/2 size smaller was just right.... Not the Hi Tops they state in the add."
2465,1,"These boots are an excellent value. They are comfortable, provide great heel and ankle support, good grip, and keep your feed warm and dry in cold climates.Purchased a pair for a vacation in New Brunswick, Canada. These boots kept my feet dry and comfortable the whole time, even while snow shoeing and hiking across a snow covered beach front. Didn't slip once in them, though I encountered ice a few times.Very good purchase!"
265665,1,"All i can say is these shoes get ""action""! I bought my pair of Hi-tech hiking boots because this is the boots i trust , when i'm packing my big bucks, big boars,ect. The traction is great and my socks doesn't get wet! Mahalo Hi-Tech!"
137229,1,"After seeing all the reviews about this shoe, I wanted to actually physically try on a pair before buying to make sure of the size. I love these shoes. They're comfortable and just great. I just wanted to post about the size difference I experienced. I have been wearing size (male) 10.5 for years now. I've bought many different shoes from different brands and this is always my style. After trying on many pairs of these shoes I finally found my size for these shoes. 8.5. A full two sizes lower! 8 was too tight and 9 was a bit too big."
238633,1,"I got very tired of having a big old ""george costanza"" wallet and i always kept my wallet in the front. So i decided to get a front wallet. its awesome and perfectly fits. Feels great. looks great. Great recommend."
371998,1,"I BOUGHT THESE FOR MYSELF. I LOVE THEM AND I WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME. I'M 51 YEARS OLD SO YOU'RE NEVER TOO OLD FOR THEM. THEY'RE COMFY AND I WOULDN'T GIVE THEM UP FOR ANYTHING. MATTER OF FACT, I HOPE TO GET SOME RED ONES REAL SOON!!"
92124,1,"I have had these slippers a couple months and we have experienced a lot of cold weather. The slippers are warm, comfortable and provide stable support IMO for a slipper. The workmanship in the footwear is excellent and the materials high quality. I am more than satisfied although cheaper slippers are available if you buy these you will not be sorry in my opinion. I have a wide foot and wear a 10.5 EEE or EEEE in my shoes. I ordered a size 11 EEE and they fit excellent although as anticipated they were tight till broken in."
33096,1,"Love these shoes - could not find them in ther stores in my area. They hae every color but white. Have a pair but they are really old and wanted a pair that looked nicer. The shoes are comfortable and they look a little more dressy than the normal tennis shoe. Paid a little more than the price at our stores but, they are worth the extra cost."
52638,1,"I have in-turned ankles and I use these shoes with my ankle supports. Not many shoes will enable me to walk in comfort with additional arch/ankle supports inserted in the shoes, but these will. It is comfort for both feet!Update May 15,2012: I bought the original pair in 2008, they are still good, albeit somewhat worn. I just purchased my second pair, and I retired the original pair for garden work only. I am pleased with both pairs of these shoes."
55315,1,"I wore my old black ones out and the navy were a great deal (under $20). Super comfortable, exactly what I expected."
199719,1,"After breaking my ankle several years ago, my physical therapist recommended these shoes. They were immediately comfortable from the first moment I put them on - no breaking in period. I wore them for 3 years, even after they were long past their useful life, because I couldn't find another pair in stores. After looking them up online, I ordered a second new pair and couldn't be happier. Perfect for my sometimes unstable ankle and tendency to pronate, cushy and comfortable."
169341,1,"the color is adorable, exactly what i want. however they run REALLY big! usually i wear a size 7.5, I've seen a lot of reviews complaining that they run big so i ordered a size 6 (ONE AND A HALF SIZE DOWN). Guess what they still run big!"
134146,1,These shoes are awesome! My son has a high instep and regular soccer cleats were way too tight. He couldn't even get his foot in a whole size larger. These cleats are wide enough that he slips his foot right in but are not too wide that he loses the feel of the ball. I highly recommend these shoes for children with wide feet or high insteps.
102575,1,"These shoes are comfortable, and the price was right. They run a little smaller per size than the Aetrex Rhino Runner which I reviewed earlier, and are not quite as comfortable to me, but I would buy another pair when these are worn out. Nice to have a black shoe for comfort wear sometimes, instead of wearing the more flashy Rhino Runner. They seem to be holding up well."
19999,1,"They are very good quality construction. They provide good support. The shoe fits well.They are Superior in comfort to my ""dress shoes"" but not quite what I had expected from a ""walking shoe"". After upgrading the inserts, it became a very comfortable shoe but still did not offer the shock absorption expected. I would buy them again but my expectations are changed."
316111,0,"I love the previous pair of janet sandals that I purchased about 6 years ago, but the newer ones were not true to size overall for me. i was saddened to return what I thought was a welcomed replacement for my very worn favorite."
78181,1,"These shoes are as soft and black as my heart is. Much more comfortable and sexy than hi tops IMHO. They'll make your feet smell, though."
365116,1,These shoes are great for the price. They are light and they let your feet breathe easily. Only con is there is no arch support so after wearing the for a while my feet hurt badly.
206678,1,"These shoes are so comfortable, The first time I put them on they felt great. The heel is a little narrow on the top so, if you have wide feet they hang over the heel a little, but, it didn't change my mind about keeping them. If you are considering these Go for it!! Great price too!!"
217321,1,"I really like the style of these shoes. I like the fact that I can slip them on and off easily without having to untie the laces. However, they are slightly uncomfortable to walk in after a short while. My other Skechers Seige shoes are much more comfortable."
155045,1,"These shoes were a birthday present for my 4yo. Based on reviews, I decided to buy one shoe size up from her current shoe size to be safe. She went up a size right before her birthday and they fit perfect. They match street shoe size as recommended. Great shoes at a great price!"
300173,2,Only saving grace for these shoes is how sharp they look. They are horribly uncomfortable and blistering. I own similar sperry's and never once had a similar issue.I strongly reccomend you buy sperry's instead
311804,1,The product arrived on time and in excellent condition. No complaints or concerns. The leather is a little tight at first but it stretches with time. The size is true.
183633,1,"For over 25 years I have relied on Softspots for casual wear. The shoes are durable and very comfortable. Great for travel and slip off going through airport security. The range of color choices (black, navy, brown, taupe) add a plus."
140224,1,"These shoes are so comfortable. They never need a ""break in"" period. I have several pairs and they wear beautifully! Even pairs that I purchased years ago look great!"
317894,1,"Great product, my daughter loves them and she learned to put them on by herself, my only issue is that one of the buttons that holds the straps was continually breaking loose, had to use a strong glue to keep it together, other than that I'm happy with the product and the shipping was very fast too."
170505,0,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
283393,0,"Although I like these Malibu sandals, they are bigger than the Life Stride ""Milani"" sandals I bought a few years ago at Macy's. I thought I was purchasing the same shoe (they look similar)- my mistake. It appears that life Stride no longer makes the Milani style. I can wear the new ones with an orthopedic insert - but am disappointed that they are such a large size seven."
116685,0,"I read the reviews and ordered a size up and they are way too big for my daughter who's having her ballet recital in two weeks! I would have to let her wear her regular practice ballet shoes and clean it with saddle soap just to make it look nicer. Now what am I suppose to do with these? I hate returning items and I guess I will just have to wait until she grows into them, hopefully she will still be interested in ballet next year!"
45180,1,I just bought this Bostonian Tahoe Oxford shoe and was very pleased how quickly it was delivered. I like buying online since I buy wide shoes and not every store carries a great selection. These shoes did come in a wide version and they fit great.....
327950,1,"Good traction, and you can feel where your foot is in relation to the ground. The laces are secure and don't flop around.Very good product."
179196,1,"This was the second time we ordered Pink Converse Shoes for my daughter, the first time I didn't get the size right. I returned them to ""Shoes R Us"" I think it was called and they took care of my mistake very quickly. Unfortunately they didn't have the size I needed so I ordered a replacement pair from Last Pairs. They came quickly, fit perfectly and were reasonably priced, the same as our local mall, without the hassle! Very good experience overall, would recommend."
130258,1,"I need a dress shoes without heels due to a bad back. These shoes were sold out at the local shoe, but Amazon saved the day! A perfect fit with soft leather uppers and patent leather toe and heel, goes perfectly with pants or skirts. The very first time I purchased shoes online and it was a success!"
319010,0,"From the description and prior reviews, I was expecting a supportive, comfortable shoe of modest weight. My current preferred shoe of this type is the S.A.S shoe (&#34;Bout Time model) that sells for twice or more the price. But it wears very well and is comfortable out of the box, which is to say it supports the foot well, and is moderately light weight. The uppers on the Hush Puppy shoes look nice, but the sole has a much larger outline than the shoe itself, which is to say, the edge noticeably sticks out. The shoe is quite heavy (compared to SAS and others). The inner support doesn't support my feet as well (less arch support). And, my foot move around in the shoe even though the size seems correct in terms of toe placement. I'll likely send them back."
380876,0,"These shoes didn't cost much, and there's reason: they're not worth much. I'm not saying they're bad, just Ok.These are the kind of leather shoes that always manage to look like vinyl (they're supposed to be leather); that don't quite ever break in properly; that grip, but not enough; that fit, but a bit clumsily; that aren't hot, just not comfortable. And The support is just all wrong. A six inch boot is problamatic to start with, so the collar (at the ankle) has to be made well: These are too wide, as is the last hieght inside the shoe, from the top of the toe to the top of the toe box, to the arch; just too roomy in all the wrong places, and my feet are dead average. I wear them, they look fine, but if I dont lace the last two lugs (from the arch to the ankle) outside, the collar will eat my ankles alive. In the end, I'm afraid they look and feel cheap."
1412,1,there is not one single other item I would consider more vital to surviving an outbreak of the walking dead. these are a must have.
84497,0,i am having trouble with my amazon orders i am still waiting for a bible tote i ordered in early june and have paid for. i ordered some crock shoes and got a double order and sent back a reply on this no responce .i like o order amazon things but have now stopped till it replys to my email on my wrong order also about my binble tote i ordered in early june . loretta bickle
2800,1,"I have to agree with L.Nesland. Shoe Goo is GREAT!!!!I bought Shoe Goo originally to repair some bicycling shoes(the heals were practically nonexistent) I found that using saliva on my finger tips keeps them clean while spreading it (you must remember I was not bonding, I was using it as an external surface). I use it to fix almost anything that needs physical enhancement. I haven't used the Goo to bond 2 surfaces together yet, but I'm SURE that it will work perfectly when I do. I agree that you should use petroleum jelly on the threads, my 1st cap broke(it glued itself to the tube threads)I haven't had that problem with my 2nd or 3rd tubes. I just finished repairing my 2nd pair of bicycle shoes. This time I'm building up the heal higher so I don't feel like I'm walking up hill. I'm glad the they came out with black, now you can use it on most dress shoes and they will still look like dress shoes. I found out (by accident) that if you want to change the color. Just after you finish spreading the goo, drip some candle wax the color you want over the goo. I had a Squirrel that was missing a leg, I made a cast of the existing leg with red wax. After the goo cured, and I took the wax off I noticed that the goo took the color of the red wax. NOW my Squirrel has a red prosthesis."
261668,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
109482,1,"a few minutes at the computer with teenager, a couple of days latter=happiness! Thank you,"
329065,1,"Wow, was I satisfied when I opened the box and slipped my foot into this shoe. Very sophisticated and extremely comfortable. I am looking forward to the warmer weather and know that this shoe will be a staple of my wardrobe whether dressing up or down.You can't miss with Donald Pliner. The quality and style are constants of his line."
351693,1,"I have to agree with all of the other reviews except the lone disgruntled one that this slipper has to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I wear them everywhere, even shopping. I've had a number of compliments on how great they look. I can't wait to get another pair, hopefully in blue if they ever become available in my size. I was hesitant about ordering them, mainly because I never have ordered shoes on-line before and because of variations in sizes among manufacturers. I normally wear size 8 and ordered 8M which fit perfectly. Hopefully, this will help provide some insight on how the sizes run."
280261,1,"Have always purchased this brand for my daughter. We love them. They fit great, they look great, and are a great value."
291500,1,"I purchased the boots for my 7 yr. old daughter. I really liked the quality and she is very pleased with them. Everytime we go somewhere, she wears them. So I know that she is pleased too! I will keep this in mind when I'm ready for another purchase. I have two otheer daughters. Thanks for your speedy shipment and prompt service."
175650,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
218711,1,I got these for my son's 14th birthday. He was so excited he threw them on on the spot. He has worn them about a month now and they are still his favorites.
137893,0,"These shoes are really cute, I get compliments on them all the time . They are perfect for wearing to work because technically they are sneakers but they really are too ""formal looking"" for their secret to be revealed :)However, I have been wearing them for about a month and I have found two problems: 1) The back of the left shoe really cuts into my heel, making it somewhat raw and red if I walk around in these shoes all day (not heavy duty walking, just walking around in the office). 2) THEY SMELLLLLL!!!!!! I am really surprised no one has mentioned this yet. They do not breathe at ALL so they (and your feet) end up stinking so badly that it's embarrassing. I never have foot odor problems with any other shoes except for these. I can even smell how bad they are if I'm sitting at my desk with my foot (yes the shoes are on) crossed over my knee... Because of these two issues, I'm not sure I would have bought them in the first place... I still wear them occasionally simply because they are so cute, but honestly it is a sacrifice to do so!**Update - After reading some other reviews/comments on here, one reviewer suggested getting the Hue ""hidden"" liner cotton socks, so i went and bought some today to wear with these, and it makes the whole smell/sweat thing MUCH better... yay!"
113914,1,"First of all I suggest 1/2 number less... if you compare it with adidas sneakers. The shoes are great, made with good materials, good design and very comfortable. I ordered these sneakers on black, but came gray on logo and the rear part, but there's no regret about it, looks so good. Definitely I recommend this item."
120842,1,I have twin sons - both in soccer - one now wears black while the other wears silver. It helps the coaches tell them apart more quickly than looking at numbers :-). Both are wearing Adidas soccer shoes and seem to find them comfortable and I was pleased with the price. Go for it!
61071,1,This is a great boot. Light with good arch support. I wear them in mud and rain and my feet are dry and warm. Well worth the money.
212246,1,"Having been an Easy Spirit fan for many years, I'm always looking for less-than-full price shoes. These ""Motion"" have been a consistently good buy, a great value shoe that holds up well, comfortable, polishes like new, and never separates at the seams. I wear the newest ones for outings, the older ones for around the house, the oldest ones for the garden. But I always watch for when they go for less than full price....because I know I will get great, consistent shoes."
388157,0,"I really wanted these shoes to work. But it's no use. The straps are too shallow for my instep...and somehow I don't feel I'm getting real support. In a way there is arch support but I like to actually feel the arch support and have less of a 'I'm wearing a cushion' feeling. As it is, for me it's like wearing a cushion while having my instep flattened by the strap.The search goes on! But if your feet are a different shape, I can see that these are soft and cute and might be great. I also happen to need real support for my feet, so this just doesn't work for me."
196589,1,I have been looking for a black pair of Chucks for a long time and I love these shoes!
179207,1,Exactly the same as what I was expecting. Size and color was perfect. It is nice to wear with skinny jeans.
315840,1,I really like these shoes. They are pretty sturdy and not as lightweight and flexible as some trail shoes or sneakers. They also have about an inch of height where you won't get wet which is nice along the water's edge.
198174,1,"I've bought these Converse shoes (both navy and white) for my son. They came on scheduled time. He liked them, wear every day."
334339,1,"I live in these shoes. I wore out my first pair of black leather flats after a year of constant wear and immediately replaced them. Currently I have them in five colors: black western leather, silver leather, brown, green and red suede, and I'm getting two more pair in black suede and gold leather. Did I mention that I love these shoes? They are superlatively comfortable, look good with everything but the most formal outfits, and hold up well in wet weather. I've worn mine through a drenching thunderstorm, stuffed them with newspaper to help them hold their shape when they were drying and they came out looking like new. I buy them in my usual size and they fit great. They don't have anything in the way of arch support, but I've walked for miles in mine with no problem at all. This shoe is the gold standard of ballet flats. Wear them till you wear them out, then buy some more.Judy Lind"
185407,1,"I like black sneakers best because you can pull them off going to casual social things like neighborhood parties, cookouts, etc. and they dont look dumpy.these are comforatable and break in nicely."
100452,1,Club C is an awesome Club to belong to. It gets you out and about in the fresh air. 1
139322,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
298109,1,"This shoes were the cristhmas gift to my best friend female, she liked them, so comfortable, cheap and originals in its style. Great product, recomended. My Best RegardsDavid"
266570,1,I am from New Zealand and buying this shoe all the way from USA was an extreme decision. I got this shoe in June 2011. I have been using it for the last few months and the following points are worth mentioning.1. Great balance and fit. though initially a bit tight and takes a bit of wearing for proper fit which is quite natural for leather.2. wear at the back heel at minimum which is a common problem for me and in some cases shoes may almost wear out in a month. (I walk to my work and return with is about daily 5kms)3. They are really waterproof! Not a even any moistness inside! Just wonderful4. Elegant and good looking!5. Worth the money spend including the $25 shipping! Will buy again the same brand and product!
106018,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
123663,0,"This shoe is aesthetically superior to anything on the market, particularly the latest version, a unrivaled gem which sports a navy blue faux-suede. If you don't actually want to PLAY basketball in these, definitely get a pair.However, if you're using the shoe for its intended purpose, I hope you have narrow feet and strong ankles. As a huge fan of the original T-Macs (didn't get the T-Mac 2's because they were too narrow), I was hoping that the 3's would restore my faith in the shoe. I'm a serious baller - I play just about every day and participate in 3 corporate/city leagues.That being said, after only owning these shoes for just three few weeks, I had to return them because I sprained BOTH ankles (never happened with the T-Mac 1's) AND severely bruised my medial and plantar nerves (never happened in my life - ever). Though ankle injuries are all too common in basketball, these injuries did not occur in the typical &quot;landed on someone's foot&quot; fashion, which is cause for serious concern. I consulted my podiatrist on the issue and she informed me that my shoes provided poor support and suggested I look into a pair of New Balances.Additionally, the outside of the shoe will dig into your ankle if you lace your shoes up tightly, as there is no cushioning around the top rim of the shoe.Proceed with caution - do not be wowed by looks, particularly if you need support or have wider feet."
315242,0,"The shoe looks great and is very comfortable. You can feel the support right away as you slip them on. Even while standing and stretching, I can feel the bounce in the ""hole""ful sole. I've had these since October and I ran 10 to 20 miles a week since I've had them. They're still in good shape but in the past month or so (maybe at the 400 mile mark) my right heel has felt tender the day after a 3 to 4 mile run. My right knee also feels locked up as I finish up my run. I'm 6'0"" and 195-200 lbs and I may be pounding my feet a little harder than the normal runner. I primarily run applying the interval training method (sprint-jog-sprint-jog...) so that may have something to do with it. I've also heard that getting the right pair of socks is also very crucial to a runner's comfort, not just the shoes. Surprise, huh?I bought this shoe when it was still priced at a full $125. FinishLine was having a promotion which I took advantage of and got it for $85 including shipping otherwise I'm not a fan of overpaying for products that perform the same as its lower-priced competitors. I'm a bit of a sneaker connoisseur so I know my kicks somewhat. My friend's orthopedist uncle has actually cut down the middle of running sneakers of a handful of the better known brands and has found that adidas are functionally better than Nikes but so is New Balance, Aasics, and Sauconys. Nike's are just damn expensive because they need to pay for Lebron's ad campaigns. I'm very intrigued to start running in Aasics and Sauconys but once I make the switch, I'll be excited to wear the Megabounces as casual shoes that I can wear around town.Like I said, they still look great!"
66621,1,I love the Breeze Walker sandal. I gave it 4 stars because they changed their sole. At least that is my opinion. I am going to call the manufacturer to check. What I am referring to is that it seems to be a man-made composition instead of the way it used to be leather. As a result I feel like it is slippery if there is perspiration. Other than that it is a very comfortable walking shoe.
262315,1,I absolutely love love love these boots!!! I'm a New Yorker living in Atlanta and im so used to wearing these boots so i was super excited to find them on Amazon...On top of the fast shipping they arrived before Christmas...These are my work boots and they were packaged just right... I'm very thankful...and great job Amazon!!
144674,1,They arrived as expected. I love the boots. Very well made and much better than other cheaper similarly looking boots.
272944,1,"wow. these shoes are awesome. they are extremely comfortable. not to mention the attention i have gotten from these (i currently own the blue ones) for instance people laugh and point out the good year insignia on the sides and back, and the distinct colors that these shoes are made in. these definitly attract attenion. and plus they just overall, look real neat. and they are unique. i am in high school, and i am the only person i know that has these shoes in a school of 2100 kids in omaha nebraska. trust me, these shoes are definatly ""hip"". haha."
56440,1,"I got these for my daughter for her work shoes, she loves them. They hold up nicely, she works for Donatos and they have held up nice."
273060,1,"These were a great buy, I had tried several different shoes and these were the best fit. I have slightly wider feet and the curved top of shoe is better for my toes than any other. They may be expensive but are more likely to fit the best!"
343220,0,Fast delivery - but my wife says the shoes are very poor quality.Worn once and tossed into the trash.Not the seller's fault however - so 5 stars to them and 1 to the mfg. thus 3 stars.
29531,1,"These were a bit larger than the size 9 that I ordered. It's a good, cheap sneaker."
143808,1,shipped fast ordered around christmas at the last minute and were brand new as listed size was right have held up great
388713,0,"I bought them 1/2 a size larger than normal and they fit fine. They will be good pair of boots to get dirty without feeling bad, how can you go wrong for $19.79."
153746,1,Great warm boot. Perfect for indoor/outdoor comfort. Have worn shorter ugg and knockoff ugg boots before. Love these tall ones!
386031,1,"The men's New Balance 574 has been around for many years. It's a 'retro' style in that it's based on an older style and comes in MANY different color combinations for the fashion-forward thinkers out there. They look vastly different than the current crop of 'minamalist' running shoes every shoe manufacturer is producing.Fashion aside, the New Balance 574 is actually a pretty decent running shoe. I've had them before many times over and they fit the shape of my foot perfectly. I do, in fact, use them for actual running. I put about 5-10 miles a week on them and they are durable, supportive, and well-cushioned. They are, however, based on 'old-shoe' technology and I've added Superfeet green insoles now that I've gotten older(see my review here on Superfeet for more information).In all fairness, most running shoes - even the high-dollar, current crop -have very poor insoles in them from the factory. The reason I've been told is because there's little 'shelf-appeal' with an insole! The only shoe I've found lately that doesn't need any help is the New Balance 990-series. Those shoes, however, are now in the $140-150 range and out of my budget.Try on a New Balance 574 the next time you're in a shoe store. Yeah... they may be marketed as a 'fashion' shoe now, but they are actual RUNNING shoes from a day when running shoes were meant to do one thing well - perform!Jae"
109999,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
352927,1,"I got these shoes to wear with a plain black dress to a school formal. You can dress then up or down. Three things i love about them are that the toe and the gathered leather give then a different look that other black flats, they are true to size (other brands's size 10 doesn't fit me), and they're comfortable.great shoes! :D"
336365,1,"I purchased these shoes for my rapidly growing tweenager. She absolutlely loved them. They are so nice, much prettier than the photo. You can not beat these prices, even at Wal-mart. I also bought a blue pair for her with the same satisfying results. Two thumbs up to this seller for offering a quality product with fast shipping at an incredible price : )"
166975,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I highly recommend these for anyone on their feet all day long. My feet were always hurting until I bought these shoes.
181968,0,I purchased these shoes because I have a hard time finding my size 5. I have purchased these before through another place and they seemed to be more comfortable and softer inside. I can only wear these for a short time before my feet start to hurt and I have to remove them.
49920,1,Bought 2 pairs of this shoe a few years ago and couldn't find them anywhere else. Finally found them here and will probably buy a few more pairs. Each of the 2 original pairs are still in use but needed new ones that looked cleaner than the other ones do now. Great pair of shoes!
268717,0,"I ordered these shoes because they are cute but the fit was off. One shoe felt 1/2 size smaller so one peep hole was bigger than the other. Two of my toes came out of one shoe and NONE and the other. It looked funny. I really wanted to keep them because they cute. Okay now,the ONE shoe that did fit. Comfort was there, width was fine, the only thing is the strap in the back of the heel hurts. It's stiff,I'm thinking it will soften up a bit with time. I'm fighting myself in ordering them and giving them a second chance. They are cute and look better in person than the photo. If you have the time and patience then I would get them. Good Luck:)"
7005,0,"the style of the boot is very cute. it fits really loose, not sure if they're just too big but i ordered the same size shoe that i wear normally. they are pretty thin so don't expect them to keep your feet much warmer than sneakers, they just cover a little more leg. the lacy part of the shoe easily gets dog hair stuck in it and also catches on things. I bought boots to help keep my feet dry at work and i knew that these particular boots wouldn't be ""water proof"" but these get wet instantly! my skate shoes protect against the water better than these. so these boots are ""cute"" but they aren't made well at all."
387323,0,"Questionable quality, already beginning to look worn out in less than a month. I expected much more for the price paid."
195709,1,"This is an excelent shoe for running in and, being in the military I do quite a bit of running. I have found this shoe to have great shock absobtion like most new balance shoes but, this one is better than most. I would recomend this shoe to any avid runners out there I only wish it cam in more colors."
28431,1,Was looking for a good shoe for Formal Wear. Found them at a local Mens Clothing store. Decided to go on line and shop around. The exact same Shoe but for 15% less and free shipping. Total overall savings was 25%.I am very pleased.
315658,0,Revisited a product I have liked before. After first wearing the leather finish was flimsier and scratched off with absolutely minimal abuse. Price held steady over time but the quality suffered.Still comfortable and true to size.
334939,0,Although these shoes are really very nice looking they are unfortunately one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have tried to wear. They're ok for a couple of hours as long as you do not need to wald a distance.
221875,1,I have to say I have a problem with a high arch and a wide foot..These slippers feel nice and snug without being tight. And give a secure feeling when you walk due to the rubber bottoms..
44890,1,"This is my 2nd pair of Keen's. I had my first pair for over five years and wore them frequently. They're extremely well made, durable, and comfortable."
24812,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
81639,1,I love shoes...I couldnt wait to get these...I had them in a few days and their great. I even got a pair for my son. I recomend the shoes and Amazon!!
254601,0,Design:4/5Comfort 3/5Quality 4/5Sizing: Runs a little big (I wear Nike size 10 or sometimes 10.5; Clarks Desert Boot size 9.5)
300952,1,This boot is very classic and stylish. My four year old son loves his boots and it matches all of his wardrobe.
315434,1,"Goodness, I've had these shoes so long now. Love them, wear them weekly in the fall and winter, and will be sad when I wear them out. Great quality, comfort, and fit, and I'm hard to fit."
202699,1,"I bought a pair of Keens for my trip to Glacier Nat'l Park. They are perfect for rafting because they have the toe-bumper in the front, so it's painless to wedge your feet in the raft. I also hiked for a few hours per day in the shoes, which was also enjoyable, but after a while my arches hurt. They don't have high arch support at all, so I couldn't wear them for too long. My feet got sweaty in the shoes, but they never felt too hot, and with a quick dip in some water, they're clean again (they also dry in a matter of hours)! They seem to run a bit small, so be sure to try on a few different sizes. The width is great, and the colors are fun. Sometimes sand or pebbles might get into the shoe and it can take a minute to remove (you will probably have to take the shoe off), but it's really not a big deal. Overall, I'd recommend Keens for their durability and versatility."
127696,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
88083,1,"I usually get a 9.5W in sandals, but the footbed was too long in this shoe and the back straps were way too loose. I reordered in a 9W and they fit a lot better, not perfectly.. but they are really cute. I throught they were pretty comfortable until I could feel the side of the zipper on one shoe cutting into my big toe. Hopefully it won't happen again!"
355712,1,"I love ASICS...I've been using these twice a week for over 3 years now. They're still functional (i.e. no holes, loose sole, etc.)."
283426,1,"I purchased these shoes in the red, because I was looking for a pair of sexy shoes with a srurdy heel. Well, when the Roxi arrived, I was a little amazed that it was on an espadrille, as I did not read the detailed description. The espadrille style does not take away anything from the shoe, yet allows it to be more light weight, which is what I wanted anyway. The sandal is comfortable and padded. My feet are slightly wide, and I did not have a problem. The patent is of great quality, and the color is vibrant. I would recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a sexy comfortable sandal. If you usually wear wide width shoes, Jessica Simpson has a few other styles (Bonee, Beve, Josette) which may suit you better. Overall a fantastic shoe."
135482,1,I'm really happy with these Chucks. Seller sent them in perfect condition a couple days before expected. Good Price. Good Purchase. Good Day!
306415,0,I got this pair when it was on sale for $15. The size is at least half size bigger than the real size should be. And very wide. The heel is really high. Not comfortable at all. The quality is not as good as the price shows. It just worth $15.
381142,1,"I have had my new Easy Spirit shoes for about 2 weeks. I love the fit and comfort of the shoes. I walk daily at least 2- 3 times and day, and I was looking for shoes that would give me the support I need, and were at the same time comfortable. I was leery about ordering shoes online because I usually like to try them on. But I took a chance, ordered my regular size, and the fit is perfect. If you are looking for a stylish and comfortable shoe that is good for walking, I think these shoes would be a good buy."
255819,1,i recommend these shoe to everyone because them fit so good on my baby's little feet not like other these shoe's are so comforable my baby can wear them all day and not want them off
328520,1,"I've never bought track shoes before and this certainly won't be my last pair. They make you feel faster and more responsive on the track, and for the price and quality buying these shoes was a no-brainer. I think a 1/2 size larger would be more comfortable."
276725,1,"I've always had good luck with Hi-Techs and this is one of the best. I've been breaking them in for about a week, they are stiff and you will probably need to do that. They are very well made and sturdy, and most importantly very comfortable.As to sizing they do seem to run a bit large, my 9.5 is a bit loose but I like extra room for insoles and thick socks. I have wide toes, narrow heel and high arches and that seems to be what Hi-Tech fits well. This toe box, while looking surprisingly narrow has penty of room for me, perhaps because of the loose fit.I have not walked over any slippery rocks so I cannot rate the outer sole. It is Hi-Tech's own which is to be expected, I guess, in lower price boots since Vibrams now seem reserved for $150-plus boots. I'll have to see if they are sticky enough for slippery rock scrambling."
95784,1,"What a joyous event these Heely's made for Amy. She can really ""whiz along with these well-made skates. Thanks Amazon and this wonderful Heely's product. She really is enjoying her Heely's.A Very Grateful Grandma & Grandaughter"
172783,1,"I saw these moccasins in a store in San Juan Capistrano CA but by the time I went back to get them, they did not have my size anymore, so I found them on Amazon.com. Lucky me! They are so soft, and comfortable. I like the color because it is neutral and I can wear them with anything and they will be good in warm weather."
116234,0,"Regards, I have not realized the comment of the purchase, due to the fact that I have had problems with the company in charge of the transport to my country, in all that it comes, I him guarantee that he will think"
121755,1,"Who says you can't have your beer and drink it too? These are the most comfortable flip-flops I've ever owned, and I can open my bottles too!! I'm seriously considering getting another pair now in case they are discontinued!"
10828,1,They were shipped promptly. I wear a 10 D in most shoes & that's what I ordered. A little big. If you can go a 1/2 size smaller I would. The lining on the inside's a little thin but about right for the price. Be careful how you choose your shipping method. Usually the cheapest method is either preselected or at the top of the shipping options. This one had the most expensive preselected & on top.
316612,1,Great Basketball Shoes. My son who is 50 years old has worn these for many years and will not wear any other shoe Goes to show age doesn't matter.
343270,1,"I was lucky enough to track down a pair of 52s, which converts to about a size 16 US. I have a very wide foot and these shoes are extremely comfortable and roomy. A previous reviewer complained about looseness, but a loose shoe might be too big for the rider. If it's the clip, that's easy enough to change with another type of clip or by tightening the clip."
54386,1,Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado. Muchas gracias. Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.Saludos desde Venezuela
318102,2,"This is the third pair of See Kai Run shoes I've had for my toddler. The others were good, and wore reasonably well. These wore terribly. After 2 months of regular use the leather on the toe is worn through. I contacted the company through my retailer and they said the wear is ""normal"" and they are not going to do anything about it. Shoes made for a toddler should hold up to several months of normal wear. I do not recommend these at all, nor am I impressed with their customer service. If you choose to buy from See Kai Run, do not expect them to stand behind their products."
128718,0,"These shoes are extremely cute, there is no doubt about that. I get compliments on them all the time. However, there are two major issues that I have with these shoes that probably would have stopped me from purchasing them (and I don't even wear them that often anymore because of these problems): 1) The back of the left shoe cuts into my heel, making it somewhat raw and red after a day at the office (light walking, nothing major). 2) THEY STINKKKK!!!! These shoes don't ""breathe"" and WILL make your feet smell terribly (if worn without socks, which is really the only way you can wear these), no matter if you have problems with foot odor or not. I have never had problems with smelly feet/shoes, but with these, I do. I can even smell how bad they are when the shoes are ON, if I have my foot crossed over my knee or something. It's really bad. Otherwise, what a shame, because these are shoes that are nice enough to wear to work without being dress shoes. Also, whereas I wear a 10 in other sneakers (athletic sneakers), I find Skechers run a bit small so I wear 9.5 in these.**Update - After reading some other reviews/comments on here, one reviewer suggested getting the Hue ""hidden"" liner cotton socks, so i went and bought some today to wear with these, and it makes the whole smell/sweat thing MUCH better... yay!"
153119,1,"This is the seventh year I have purchased the Easy Spirit Slip-ons - I find them extremely comfortableand very convenient for slipping on and off, especially in Dr.'s offices, etc.Will most certainly buy this product again."
377272,1,"I was a little skeptical at first given the cost. But, I have to say that I am fully converted. Break-in was almost negligible. I have been through Ireland, France and climbed the Pyrenees in Spain with these boots. They still look new. Great Vibram tread and my feet stay warm and dry. Laces up easy. They fit a bit narrow compared to other boots I have. My size was a 1/2 size smaller than regular shoes. Takes on a nice shine that looks like glass. These are my favourite duty boot for work. Highly recommended. You get what you pay for. Note: When choosing, make sure the particular model is made in the USA. There is a difference."
155781,1,"These shoes look great, are comfortable, and affordable.The only downside is that, for me, they don't hold up all that long. I've gone through 2 pair in less than 2 years. They start to come apart inside after awhile. I put allot of time in on my feet though. 60 hours a week or so. I guess for some reason I expect shoes to last longer.But they are a good value. I'll keep buying them as I wear out old ones."
182871,2,"The shoe that came was not the shoe shown here. No stitching on the back of the shoe and the cut of leather is inferior. Very disappointed, I have worn Florsheim for a long time--but never again!"
123707,1,The new style of the T-macs. These are the best. They are very comfartable. I bought them the day they came out. If you are into black then buy them now. Because I know they are coming out in White and Blue so they will have the same pattern as last year. So if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid December. Otherwise this show is very comfy and better than last year.
78933,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
354716,1,"I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
385202,1,I've worn Clark's shoes for years. These didn't disappoint. The fit is normally true-to-size and the styles are current without being trendy. My only complaint is that they were a little too wide this time.
172485,1,"This is a great shoe, one of the best I've ever purchased. This shoe has it all, comfort, style, and fit. If you have a wide foot or a high instep, this shoe will still be comfortable on your foot. This is a great shoe for anyone who has to be on their feet for long periods of time. It looks especially nice with jeans or other causal pants."
236537,1,Receiver??? You are denied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Adidas plus talented corner back equals devistating defense and victory against any offense!! Adidas is Victory!!
195019,1,"Love the style of this sandal. Not my first pair. Very comfortable, good fit in the size I need. The only problem I had was that the color was not what I thought I was ordering, but would like to have more colors in the same style."
102451,1,the fit the thickness in the sole just a perfect shoe. my old ones wore out was not sure about ordering online but did and very glad. thanks.
311315,1,"Bought these for my daughter. She was looking for a lightweight comfortable shoe, and this one fit the bill. They are comfortable to wear at work as well as around the house she says."
313066,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
31072,0,The boot is attractive but the pictures make it seem as if the upper portion of the boot is more rigid but in reality it is not rigid at all. More flexible and doesn't look as good as if it was rigid.
245056,1,This is one of my son's Christmas wishes. It arrived on time. My son loves it so much. It's just like what's described and pictured.
374717,0,"I agree with the previous mom who wrote a review. We actually bought ours at Target as well, and the sizing is quite off. Plan on buying a size smaller than your child usually wears! Other than the sizing issue, the boots are super cute and my son absolutely loves them. He likes to wear them around the house for dress up play as well.... we don't get much rain where we live."
277620,1,"These boots fit very well to me and are rather comfortable. The grip on these are great, and after about 300 miles of use in these, they still look new. Highly recommend these boots for anyone on a budget."
184389,1,"I love my new moccasins, they are perfect for winter time because of the heat they give your feet! I have very cold feet all the time so they help me warm up. I do have one complaint and it's because of the ties, they tend to become untied when you walk so you have to be careful not to trip on them."
323121,1,"my wife wears small size, hard to find good fit. very pleased with her purchase"
236282,1,"I go through a pair of these each year, and I keep coming back to them. They are comfortable, durable, fairly light and priced right. I usually buy these at a police supply site, but Amazon is much more convenient and had them at a better price. I highly recomend these, and their shorter cousin, the 6 inch ATAC side zip."
135589,0,Shoes fit nice. Love them! Had to reattach buckles on both sandals so that was'nt good. But I didnt have time to return them and get replacement before our trip.
7706,1,"Searched local stores, this shoe and no where to be found. Ordered on Amazon, and it is exactly what I wanted. I am extremely pleased."
241305,1,"They came in a timely manner, in the little Converse box. They're just as the should be: classic kicks that will last a long time."
338968,1,"excellent!!!My daughter wanted red and we couldn't find them anywhere, not even on the converse site. So we are real pleased with Amazon for finding them for us."
304233,1,"So far I am quite happy about this purchase, like the color and style, quite comfortable too, haven't experienced bad weathers yet, don't know whether whether the water will go through it in the rainy weather.. I am glad I chose half a size smaller than my usual size, thanks to the previous comments:)"
220085,1,"I love these shoes. Very cute, simple, classic style. The graphite color is very versatile (comes with white laces if you don't dig the yellow). Some arch support for comfort and good structure to the shoe. I wouldn't run a marathon in these shoes, but they are perfect on the weekends or vacation, when you be doing a good amount of walking but still want to look cute."
121390,1,"im glad with this product, i know them from before and was a good price."
175491,1,I received my Scout Sandal very quickly. It was in perfect shape and fit just like was supposed to.I am very pleased with the service and the product.
139838,1,"I've always liked LifeStride shoes. These are very comfortable and they look good. I'll definitely buy a pair again, soon."
113358,0,"Of the stride rite shoes I've purchased, these seem to bother my son's feet. He loves the various sneakers and ""bulldozer"" boots. He has an extra wide foot, and all the stride rite products accomodate this. The Danny shoe leaves red marks on his ankles. And he seems to complain when we put these on him. I'd recommend a higher cut dress shoe."
8984,1,"Shoe is high quality, well made and very comfortable- I wear it everyday. Received many compliments from others. Highly recommended."
339032,1,I love my new shoes. They are perfect for CrossFitting since they are flat. Perfect for squats. Thank you!!!
34572,2,this shoe is just perfect with everything but when you walk with it for a long time your toes will hurt w/the wooden sole... Just to painful.. good for short distance walking.
145060,1,My daughter thought it was the best gift ever. I loved the price. I gotta order me a pair now
95830,1,"Great shoes, very comfortable. However, I usually wear these with shorts (live in AZ, too hot for pants), and because the shoes look stupid when wearing socks so I usually go barefoot (really great for the beach or pool). But because of this, the shoes get very smelly, even after spraying shoe freshener in them. After i take them off, the smell is absorbed in my feet, and if i walk around my house barefoot, everyone can smell it. Overall, great shoes, however if you wear these bad boys barefooted, be prepared to have to wash you feet after taking them off."
282292,1,These make wonderful Taekwondo mat shoes. They decrease mat friction and still allow you to see your foot positions. They pack easily. My new one's are my 3rd pair.
378404,1,"I usually wear a street size 8 1/2 narrow or slim and I ordered this shoe in a few different sizes. The 9 1/2 narrow fit the bill perfectly. The shoes are great for the stage/dance and so comfortable I'd wear them as street shoes if they had my size in the caramel.If you look at the shoe in the box (at least in the narrow width), it is a fairly slender-cut shoe so if you have a narrow foot, fear not--this shoe should fit you fine."
90636,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
328893,1,These shoes are comfortable and look great. Addidas shoes tend to run a little smaller than some other brands. These shoes have a little higher arch than I prefer (I have flat feet)but nothing that is too intrusive.
110147,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
199321,0,"I bought the shoes for my husband. He says, ""The shoes are not comfortable. I like the colors and they look good but they are not comfortable at all. I will probably never buy this type again."""
151262,1,Incredible boots accomodating an appealing/aggressive style as well as providing great comfort for your feet on all terrain.
269442,1,"After one or two weeks of break in period,these rockport prowalkers are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had,bar none. This includes any top of the line running shoes I've had such as New Balance. Ecellent value and comfort! Can't beat it!"
219623,1,"The shoes arrived in perfect condition, true to size (10.5) fabulous bright red color, not a problem at all. Would definitley do business with the seller again. Thank you!"
165831,1,"These boots are great, I bought them to go with my halloween costume a while back and now I wear them every time I go out. Its been 7 months now and there still in great condition."
78864,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
83037,1,"I love reef flip flops, they hold up well, and mold to your foot in no time. They kinda rock"
105135,1,"It's been a little over a year since I purchased a pair of these shoes in the brown color option in my usual size. I don't wear them on a regular basis--I am generally in skirts and dressier shoes if I am out of the house--but when I travel they are excellent to wear, and they are also fine for trips to the supermarket in colder weather. I wore these shoes almost non-stop when I visited my parents recently and stayed for a few days; they were great for walking around town and window shopping as well as traipsing across fields in the mountains. My left shoe gives me some pain across the top of my foot, I am unsure as to why this is the case, but I laced my shoes up in a 'hackey-sack' configuration so there is less pressure there, and the left shoe is almost comfortable now. During longer treks I still feel some discomfort but I do not blame that on either the shoe or my foot, they just probably are not the best match for each other. But my right foot feels perfectly fine in its Eastland shoe, nice and snug and solid. My grandmother, when she saw me during my trip, asked me if I've grown (I'm in my thirties so that is highly unlikely!), and I said it was the shoes! From looking at them casually on someone's feet you would probably would not notice the height in the sole and heel, as it is not obtrusive, but it is there."
58963,1,"After having to return them because they didn't fit, I got the perfect pair of shoes. They even paid for the return shipping. They look great!"
73274,0,I think I bought these for my wife several years ago. The dog chewed them. He got more use than my wife.
76140,1,"This boot is awesome! It feels amazingly comfortable, for all it's buckles, zips and stacked, super high heel. I was looking for a 'knock off' look-alike boot for a ""Selene"" from ""Underworld"" Halloween costume. This boot is almost identical AND it's comfortable and I'll probably end up wearing it for other outfits!"
149578,1,"If you have high or moderately high arches with a tendancy to wear down the shoes on the outside of the foot, you are like me. This shoe is pretty good for that type of foot and still provides decent to good heel support. The outside of my legs around the calves tend to cramp a little while running (less when I warm up), and while this shoe doesn't completely fix that, it helps it better than even Saucony's did. Other than Asics, Saucony, and now Mizuno, I wouldn't wear anything else.The other problem I've had for several years is heel and achilles soreness for a short time after running. This shoe comes close to eliminating that problem, but the Mizunos I've recently tried seem to have a bit more cushioning.Asics is a great product, and this shoe is a moderately priced option for underpronators like me. If that word means nothing to you, you need to research running shoes and have your own feet checked out at a running shoe store."
204742,1,"I paid $15 for these shoes through Amazon and they are wonderful!! Another pair I can add to my growing collection! I can't say enough about these shoes! I wear them almost everyday! They are comfortable, very durable, and come in an assortment of colors (to match every outfit). Reefs are simply spectacular!"
282698,1,"After 18 years, my husband finally let go of his Rainbow Flip Flops bought in 1989. Granted the past two summers of wearing them has been an act of love on his part but, they were his favorites and though slightly cracked from lying in the sun....he could still wear them. He was like a kid with a toy when he received his new pair for Christmas...and though the logo was different, the name was the same and the quality appeared to be the same, as well. When he bought his one and only orignal pair in 1989...we gasped at the price since it was higher than the drug store brands...but, they are worth every penny...no gasps needed...they last almost forever...made extremely well...comfortable, handsome leather...we're fans!"
286879,1,"I could not find replacement strings anywhere, so naturally I tried Amazon. They had an approved store front so I felt comfortable doing business with them. I received the laces in record time."
386432,1,I can't really judge the answering machine since I have not yet had the time to install it. It looks OK.
316416,1,Purchased as a gift. She likes them. Warm and cozy. Can go outside easily.
317058,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Please continue to make these.
283972,0,"Somehow I don't feel comfortable when there are two belts or shoelaces not linked anywhere. Their width is not equal. So if I sew them on the shoes, that won't look nice. The shoes may not need a lace to tie tight. But to secure, the laces may still be needed. So I will return the shoes."
14137,1,I purchased shoes from Overstock.com and the shoes were perfect. They arrived on time and the fit was exact. Will certainly order from the manufacturer again.
242338,1,I love my converse! You should get some too. I love theway they look and smell when they are brand new! They come in allKind of colors and you can make your own . they have lasted on theMarket since 1935! You need to run and your own pair right now!
250850,1,This was exactly what I was looking for. I had this pair of shoes before and was not finding a replacement in the stores. This shoe turned out to be exactly the same as the pair I had purchased before and been so happy with. I was quite pleased
200906,1,"I've been wearing topsiders since 1974 as casual footwear, as bedroom slippers, and even as gardening shoes. My only complaint is that not all colors are available in all sizes. Other than that, it is my shoe of choice and always will be."
132526,1,"And she uses it every single week for her ballet dance classes. They are snug and slip on easily on her little foot, and she can do it all by herself... exactly what they are meant to be ..."
288099,1,"Happy, happy, happy. Everybody happy.Nobody makes better sandals than Birkenstock. I suggest you go down to a local store to get your feet sized in european sizing before ordering online."
114345,1,"I am very pleased with my purchase, I bought the black and white for my grandaughter who is part of the chidlren's dnce ministry and I got them jsut on time..recommend this seller. If you need fast shipping this is the seller. and theprices are affordable. great shoes thanks!"
51207,1,LOVE THIS ITEM! Used it several times for 3 day trips and it even holds the Kindle and mini computer.
361952,1,This shoes look sleek no doubt about that. Ive been trying to get my hands on them for a while now but i can't seem to find them anywhere. Can anyone tell me where to buy a beautfiul shoe like this?
330908,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
117761,1,"These are a nice pair of leather ballet shoes. Although the size I ordered was still big for my daughter, even tho Ive read reviews to order one size up because they ran small. I found it to run almost true to size for my daughter."
165818,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
175682,1,"These are great shoes! I have problem feet that are difficult to fit. Most shoes are very uncomfortable on my feet, but these are not. It's nice to have good-looking shoes that I can wear with dresses and other outfits and still feel comfortable. I recommend these Softwalks to other women who have bunions or wide, difficult-to-fit feet."
247491,1,"These shoes are cute and comfortable, although they run a tad small. I hope they'll stretch out a little with wear."
153178,1,"these slip-on's are extremely comfi, very light and attractive. they are true to size Will get more in different color!"
276967,1,"I love wearing these boots when walking in the mud, snow or hiking. Because they are leather I have a second pair for my garage that I use while welding. My father is tough on shoes and it's difficult to find shoes that fit his wide feet. I gave these as a gift and he loves them. They lasted him about a year. So every Christmas I buy him a new pair. Mabey i'll get him two this year."
321294,1,Now first thing is first I am not a dancer... at all but I bought theses shoes because they where cute and I wanted something nice to wear around the house. Now I saw that people where complaining about how to shoe gapes around your foot. Well you know the string that is in the front? Untie those and pull them has hard as you can and BAM it gets tighter! I got annoyed for the same reason because I thought about taking the elastic off and moving it to the gaping hole but after the string became untied I tried that trick and now they are perfect. Another thing is I would suggest to order at least a half size smaller because personally I like shoes to be a bit snug but this is my thing. Just another note if you are in a dance class then its better to take the advice of your teacher V.S a review from amazon :)
166557,1,"Got the shoes for my boyfriend for valentines and he absolutely loves it! Fits perfectly on him, price was perfect for my budget and a perfect valentines present!!!"
38346,1,"These boots were given to my husband as a replacement of something similliar but the heels have held up so much better on these boots. He was happy with the fit, not too tight, and how well they hold up in all kinds of weather. The color and leather still look great."
185703,1,These are soooo comfortable. They're not as snug around the upper foot as a &#34;tie&#34; type shoe would be but they still have the great arch/foot support and you can slide them on so quickly. They also look nice with almost any slacks.
282555,0,"I've worn Rainbows exclusively for about 7-8 years and figured I'd give the hempies a try. At first I really enjoyed the sandal, the feeling of hemp after all of the years of cold leather was, for lack of a better word, comforting. This only issue I had with these was that the hemp material wore down in no time; I reckon it was less than 2 months before my big toes on both feet were breaking down to the next layer. The hemp material also started to gunk-up a bit within a couple uses which left them a bit more unsightly than the leathers (I'm not THAT dirty). If I purchased another pair I would probably just make sure its not my daily sandal."
31948,1,I bought these because they looked light weight yet sturdy. I am pleased with them. They keep my feet dry and I have not had a problem yet with them.
72431,2,"I was looking for a comfortable wedge heeled shoe to wear with jeans, and disappointingly, this wasn't it. I wear a size 8-1/2 M and rarely have to order anything other than my true size. This shoe was tight in the toes and very uncomfortable -- they felt too small and a bit on the narrow side. I didn't think ordering a half size up would resolve the problem and honestly didn't want to have the hassle of exchanging them with the risk of the replacement size not working out well, either. I opted to return these."
50572,1,I bought these to go with my super girl costume for Halloween & these shoes turned a so so costume into a va-voom one. I usually wear a size 7 medium width boot so that's the size I ordered & it fit perfectly. I also usually have trouble with boots because my calves are athletic & tend be a little thicker but the lace up allows you to adjust and I was amazed at how comfortable the shoes are. I got everyone's attention and received a ton of compliments so i was very happy with this purchase. I plan to find another costume that i can wear these boots with for next Halloween.
218739,1,These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. The price was the best I've seen anywhere. I couldn't be happier.
35813,1,Love this shoe for my baby.Another one to add to his collection of Chucks.
36525,1,THE KEDS SHOES WERE GREAT. THE GIRLS LOVE THEM AND THEY ARRIVED WHEN SAID.WOULD ORDER THEM AGAIN AND PROBABLY WILL.
223683,1,"Who wouldn't want a pair of Timmies? As a female, I too have a pair and love them for comfort and warmth."
190622,0,"These boots are not true red. They have a bit of dark brick or maroon tinge to them. I was disappointed in the color but my daughter did not notice. They seem comfortable and sturdy, although after just a few weeks there are a few spots where the color has flaked off, but I'm not surprised because they are being worn hard and often."
11929,1,"Very cool shoes, decent price and a very quick shipper. what more could you ask for?"
356872,1,I gave these KED Sneakers a 5 Star rating because they are everything I expected and more! Thrilled to pieces!
323529,1,Great price and fast delivery. My husband has several pairs of these shoes and loves them. I was glad to find them on sale.
377740,1,These were a gift; the recipient reports that they fit well and are holding up nicely. These slippers have timeless good looks.
380290,1,these are great and fit true to size...not too high for dancing...color is close to skin and blends nicely with my leg
327901,1,"first of all, i am a big soccer fan and i have been playing the sport for more than 12 years, i play at least 3 times a week so i have tried aloooooooooooot of shoes,dont bother by the nike crab ( except for the talaria model for its light weight 7 lb ! ) ... this addidas shoe is really great, gives you great grib on the ball thanks to the leather exterior and curivng of the side. when you try it you might find it heavy so give it time (two games max) and you will see . great heel support and for the fashon lovers its nice looking."
289632,1,I love these boots they are perfect for my six year old. They are durable and I love the darker color so the dirt does not show as much. The price was great and shipping was fast
324800,0,NICE SHOES FIT WELL HARD TO PUT ON OPENING IS SMALL TO GET YOUR FOOT IN ... DONT BUY IF YOU HAVE A HIGH INSTEP
33023,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
172327,0,great for a light weight sneaker. not very stylish though.
72782,1,has anyone else bought them? i want to know if they would fit well over my muscular calves? i don't have thin legs. before making this purchase i would really like to know about the fitting. i hate returning items. thanks in advance!
97693,1,My son loves his Wallabees. They were a Christmas gift and he wears them all the time. I was not disappointed!!
172273,0,Just what I was looking for BUT I wear a 7.5 and have a high arch. They ran small on me and I had a really hard time getting them on. It's a shame because I liked the look....has to send them back
165257,1,My daughter loves these. They are bright and warm and fun to wear.the only problem with these is that they show stains more easily than a darker color.
264758,1,"love this shoe...very comfortable and the look is great. The first day I wore this shoe I received numerous compliments. I will be buying more in the future. I have such a hard time finding a shoe that fits and that makes my day pleasurable,this shoe fits the criteria of a ""GREAT SHOE"". I was a little skeptical at first buying a shoe on line, but was very pleased when I got this and tried it on : I would recommend this shoe to everyone!!!!!"
274075,0,"This seems like a nice boot, but my usual size was just too large, and I'm not sure they make a half size smaller (11.5)"
343561,1,"These shoes are a blend of sneakers and shoes, can be worn with all types of casual clothes. Extremely comfortable, need no breaking in. Can be worn all day and are good as a walking shoe. I love them."
291370,1,Bought these to wear at my son's wedding reception after my high heels became uncomfortable. These slippers did the job and I wore them the rest of the evening.
176661,1,Great boot! Have held up to spraying pesticide's Monday through Friday Very well!! I would buy this boot again! They still look new after nearly a year of use.
80451,1,"My mom would never wear these unless I bought them, but she loves them!!! They are uber comfortable and she feels like a teenager again!"
214989,1,"An American made, high quality boot. The boots were comfortable from the start. They didn't require a break in period."
70509,1,"Not only are the the Puma Anjan trendy and hot but they are also the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn. I bought my first pair last summer, as I work long shifts on my feet and these shoes are excellent for that. They are thin and have breathable mesh, I very much recommend you go out and buy them."
106668,1,"I love these shoes. After putting ~250 miles on the first pair I bought, I bought two more in different colors to stockpile away, just in case they discontinue this model."
171872,1,"Nothing bad to say about these shoes. Fit was great, color was spot-on but what I thought would be a cool take on men's wear seemed dated to me. Perhaps it was the finish on the leather or the sole. Either way I sent them back. Hope to find something similar with a bit more pizazz. A gold heel or patent leather..."
108245,1,"Several years ago, I moved into hotter inland climates which have prolonged intensely hot summers. My work requires formal business attire. Needless to say when I get home from work, or am off for the weekend, I wear my reefs with absolute pleasure. They are extremely comfortable and will contour to your foot, to provide nice stability, keeping your foot on, or rather in the surface on the flip-flop. The tread and traction is excellent as well. They are comfortable stylish and keep your feet cool during hot weather. Everytime I put them on, I know I will be relaxin, ahhhhh, how nice. Best flip flop on the market. Have tried others, but the simplicity of the Reefs reign supreme. As far as fit goes, if you are a half size such as 9.5, get a 10, they will fit perfectly.On a side note, 6-7 years ago, Reef made a flip flop I liked even better, it had a twist to the design which I loved. Basically, instead of the nylon fabric which goes in between your toes, they had one with an extremely soft comfortable rubber which went in between your toes. It was slightly more comfortable than the nylon part, they employ in all their flip flops now, except for their all rubber ones. Another benefit of this rubber part was it kept the nylon strap elevated, so when you put your foot in, it went right in, you did not have to squiggle your toes to raise the nylon strap in order to slide your toes in and get the toes seated up against the nylon, or rather in this case the soft rubber. With this rubber part, you just put your foot in, and voila, you're off and relaxin, totally hassle free. This was not an all rubber piece that went from the toe strap and all the way to back of the flip flop forking and branching off to the rear of the flip flop where they attach to the deck rear deck of the flip flop on both sides in the rear; it was not a totally nylon-fabric free flip flop, in other words it was not all rubber like other flip flops by Reef and other manufacturers. It was a hybrid, with a rubber part that elevated the nylon straps, so you could just glide right in. It combined the best of both worlds with the convenience of the rubber part where you put your toes in, but after that nylon straps were attached to that rubber toe-piece and went back and attached to the rear deck of the flip flop. The nylon straps are more breathable than rubber and keep your feet nice and cool, while the rubber part that goes in between your toes, made them the ideal, best flip flop ever made. I hope someone from Reef comes across this review. Bring back the hybrid Reef, myself and others will buy them again and again. Also these flip flops are extremely durable. I wear the heck out of them; I mean I put serious mileage on them. I usually buy them every two years,"
149756,1,"The straps on the right foot seemed a bit tighter than the ones on the left, so, I got some blisters when first wearing it. However, over time, the fabric stretched a little making them much more comfortable. They're great! So cute and yet so comfortable!"
182851,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
375144,1,"My mom has really wide arthritic feet. She has arthritis in her ankles, feet, knees, 1 hip, and lower spine. I ordered these shoes for her, after trying a large variety (about 10 other pairs) of shoes. None of the other styles we tried fit. She either couldn't get her foot in, or, in the case of ankle boot styles, they wouldn't close around her ankles. These were a last resort because she doesn't like the tennis shoe look (she's 72). Nevertheless, these fit! Hooray! They are comfortable and stable. The velcro can be adjusted to different widths. Totally worth the money and true to size!"
359950,1,These shoes were just as expected and comfortable to dance in. The order came very quickly and arrived on the expected date.
371339,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
292435,2,Problem with this shoe is that they don't carry my size 8.5 double E. So why is that I am having a problem finding my size. Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department. To me there is no excuse of not carring my size.
126200,1,"I bought these shoes about four months ago and I only wear them when I play racquetball. After a lot of use they are still in perfect shape, they have great grip and are really light. I consider myself a beginner at racquetball, but one thing is for sure; once I got these shoes it definitely stepped up my game. Id recommend these shoes to anyone."
283151,0,"Very comfy, would probably be more comfortable if I wasn't pregnant and had extra weight bearing down on my feet."
289551,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
68026,1,"I bought my puma's on amazon like 4 years ago, before everyone else started wearing them. I can't stand big giant basketball shoes with velcro, and springs that look like space boots. If you want nice casual kicks you need to get some pumas. They have tons of cool colors and you can't go wrong with black. Who doesn't love these."
291794,1,These boots are made for rough and tough boys. They look great even though they've been worn nearly every day for a month!
211105,1,"Good basic black pump. It took a couple wears to break in the shoe, but since has been fairly comfortable."
241094,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
9099,1,"My mother has long, narrow feet and has had difficulty finding a good fit. This was convenient and a perfect fit. She's delighted -- and so am I."
308183,1,I got them today around the time they said they would be here. The shoes were in great condition inside the box and they were just what I expected to be. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I would order from them again.
222936,1,"I ordered these shoes to wear on a cruise. I had seen them in the mall, but Amazon had them for much less.... They were made well and are fairly comfortable despite their height. I have worn them several times, dressed up and dressed down. I highly recommend them."
296887,1,I had a pair of these in 1976. I've gone retro and still look good in my stylish comfortable Treks.
3843,0,"These seemed like good quality boots, however the sizing was 1/2 a size off. I ended up returning the product so I can't speak for actual comfort or longevity of product. But it is frustrating when a product doesn't fit. Shoes are usually pretty constant too. I purchased these particular ones based on all the great reviews but I didn't see any that commented on sizing issues, so just beware."
137171,1,"This shoes came in and i feel in love with them, they are in great condition. Just what i wanted and expected! the color is great. They came in the box and they looked stunning. I totally recommend them!"
326232,1,TAD SLICK ON KITCHEN WET FLOORS COMPARED TO OTHER NON-SKID SHOES.. VERY COMFORTABLE ..WORE THEM FOR 7 HOURS WAITING TABLES AND THEY WAY MORE COMFORTABLE THAN SHOE FOR CREWS OR TREAD SAFE..SO I GAVE IT A 4 STAR...THEY JUST COULD BE A TAD MORE NON-SKID FOR MY TASTE...
36428,1,"I was hoping to order these in 10 1/2, but that appeared to not be an option. I have a difficult time with many shoe manufacturers not offering my size. I use extra inner soles & that helps, but I wish my size was available."
360036,0,"I ordered a size larger as recommended and it turned out to be too large for me. Half a size larger would have been better. The shoes feel comfortable, except that the sole of the shoes feels slippery. I was afraid I would slip and fall, so I returned the shoes."
168531,1,"I found these shoes to be great. You can wear them anywhere on dry land in place of regular sneakers, and not worry about wearing them into the water. If you pick up muck, just wash them out with a hose. They were much better than the cheap ($10) beach shoes I had previously."
216506,0,">Comes with an extra pair of black laces for you to exhibit your fashion spunk.>Also has the traditional white laces so that you can stay...traditional.>You get two pairs of laces for the price of one.>Note: the shoes come already laced with white laces. The extra pair of black laces comes in the shoe box.BTW, these don't come with the black laces as advertised. Obviously that's not why I bought them, but I thought it was a pretty good deal to get both white, and the black they advertised for. Overall, the shoes are good as always, but kinda dissapointing to not get what was offered. Guess I can't exhibit my fashion spunk afterall...lol."
65667,1,"I bought these for my 18 month old daughter. They are adorable with tights! She loves having these on. I'd say they run a little big, but I'm fine with that. It's sometimes nice to have sneakers to put on her that she can't take off!"
102288,0,"i've been looking for mary jane's for a while and decided that i'd give these a try since they were so reasonably priced. they also come in wide sizes, and that's a plus. i just received them and i have yet to wear them. i did try them on. while they are super cute, they are also really big. my feet get wider the closer you get to my toes, so my feet are sort of like...ducks feet?! lol. anyway, i imagine these would be comfortable enough for people that have the longer second toe. my second toe is much shorter than my big toe, that combined with the duck-like shape of my feet, causes these shoes to be a bit uncomfortable. the way the toe area is designed it leaves a huge gap between my smaller toes and the end of the shoe, and presses my big toe into my other toes.i realize that the shape of my feet are not the norm, but i know a few other people with similar problems and i thought i'd point these things out. to be make it clear...the toe area has it's longest point in front of where the second toe would be. anyone with a wide width across their toes might find these uncomfortable.they are also a lot bigger than i expected. i usually wear a regular 9 1/2 and these wide width 9's feel a lot more like a 10 or a 10 1/2 to me.they are cute though."
247507,0,But the size is very small for the normal we find in other modelsMy 11 received is like 10.
175668,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
243386,1,Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado. Muchas gracias. Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.Saludos desde Venezuela
255297,1,"These were the only sneakers we could find for our 1 year old who has wide feet like his dad. Most other brands do not come in wide, leaving very few choices on the market. These shoes look great and go with everything. Our toddler adjusted to them quickly, so they must be comfortable too!"
55006,1,"great shoe at a great price, classic shoe that goes well with just about any outfit, fits snug so may want to size up"
192562,1,"This is the third time I have purchased this shoe, it isso comfortable, my other shoes are jealous as they sit silently in the closet collecting dust. If you want a comfortable shoe, a good looking shoe, I recomment this one. And the price was right!"
76814,0,"The Capezio shoe looks great, but had to send back. Even ordering a half size larger than my street shoe, it was too small."
204507,1,My elderly mother has bunions and hammers toes. She likes a little heel and these are perfect for her. This is the third pair she gets. These are also VERY durable.
58354,1,This style of Keds are cute enough to wear with summer dresses and maxi skirts. They provide more arch support than ballet flats and are good for lots of walking.
116488,1,These shoes were ordered to replace a pair just like them so obviously I liked them originally and like them now also.
205317,1,"I originally got my first pair of this shoe at Sears like 5 years ago, and they rocked, lightweight, easy to clean, comfy. But then I moved overseas to my next assignment, and I forgot them at my parents house! And guess what my Dad gave them to Salvation Army, so now here I am reunited with the best shoes in the world I think. Thank god I found them on Amazon! Someone out there maybe still got a free pair of great shoes for free :-P"
316001,1,"The wide designation for shoes means an E width. D was once wide but has become narrower. So if you want a wide, comfortable, supporting shoe that looks good enough to wear to church, this is the shoe for you. Leather is thick and shiny. Good inner support. True to size."
226539,1,Sweeet!...my boy is flipping over these. He wants to wear them everywhere - I drew the line at church.
119191,1,"I've purchased these slippers for years, so I knew what I would be getting. They are the best for flexibility and for showing point."
5700,1,"These flipflops are both well-made and comfortable. The strap material is soft and didn't cause any irritation or discomfort from day 1. The arch support is made for someone with moderate arches so it should be comfortable for most people. They are designed to give reasonable traction when wet or dry so they're great for a day at the lake. The dram only holds about an ounce of fluid but hey, it's more for fun than anything else. If you're planning to use these to sneak your alcohol into a sporting event then I'd come up with another strategy. But they do make a good conversation starter. The only reason I give them four stars instead of 5 is that the dram is made of hard plastic and so reduces the cushioning in the heel area somewhat. But other than that I'd recommend them."
352640,1,Thought I had ordered these in 9 M - They were ordered as a gift and they fit her OK after all... She really likes them.
62886,1,The shoe was exactly what I was looking for and the price was better than on Keds own web site.
46191,0,Shoe looks great but the size I ordered ran small. I bought about 6 pair of sandles this year and all fit well but they were bought at the store and I tried them on. These were the same size but were just a little small.
325313,1,"I was worried that the shoes would be an ill fit. When they arrived I found my worries were for nothing because the shoes were true to size, not too snug or loose. The material is good, and the heel is strong! You don't have to worry about it snapping off if you have to do a lot of moving around (which happened to a pair of costume shoes I bought from a different seller!) they hold up fine. Highly recommended to break in the shoes before the event you plan to wear them for though otherwise you'll be sore all day. :) Also as other people have mentioned if you are a half size I would suggest ordering a size UP instead of DOWN."
56006,1,Love these boat shoes. A+++++for comfort in the front toes and back heel. Hope they sell other colors. Nice construction.
81794,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
295221,1,"I bought 2 pairs of these, one for me and the other for my girlfriend, to walk to class during the winter. They do exactly what they are designed to do in terms of traction on ice, but there are some drawbacks. First of all, they can be tricky to put on. I figured out how to do it with one hand without sitting down, but my girlfriend needed me to put them on for her the first couple weeks and still needs to sit down and use two hands now. This shouldn't be a problem for many people who are doing outdoor activities and won't be putting them on and taking them off repeatedly throughout the day. Secondly, they are treacherous on hard floors. This is clearly indicated on the box, but it is pretty surprising how easily the wires slide across smooth tile. They seem to fare fine against pavement for those non-icy patches, but you really do have to take them off when you go inside. I think this is true of all winter traction aides, but it can be a hassle for a college student who walks to and from class a few times a day. A nice bonus is that they do fold up pretty nicely and fit into my pocket. Also a positive is that they stay on exceptionally well right over your shoes and I have yet to have a slip while wearing them.I would recommend these to anyone who does walking on snow pack or ice regularly."
35511,1,"Second pair that i have purchased for working a 12 hour shift. Boots are steel toed, rated for 600 volts, and light and flexible. Feel like regular boots. I even wear them on my days off sometimes as they are a good looking shoe. Company purchases 1 pair of safety shoes per year, and after 16 years i have gone through many different brands of safety shoes. These are the best. No leg fatigue or foot pain. They come in wide size, but normal size fits fine. I enjoy the added safety of the 600 volts rating as i work around high voltage constantly."
131302,0,"Sole/footbed is weak/ thin especially in arches,inner liner stitching is seperating as new pretty wimpy overall,short time snow shoveling at best"
213044,1,"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But, if you're a newcomer to them, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers."
348900,1,Excelent quality. Really comfortable and an awesome shipping time.A great G.N.AGoodNiceAffordableNow I ordered another pair for my son.
143599,0,"These shoes have been great for work, but they only lasted about 6 months. Granted, I do work in a laboratory dealing with coal, limestone, and various other matrices, but I would think the soles of a good shoe would last longer than these have. With that being said, the shoes are comfortable and are definitely stain-resistant. I've spilled or dripped many different acids and caustics on them over the past 6 months and they've held up well (except for the soles, of course). These are good work shoes if you don't mind replacing them every 6 months."
244110,1,"Purchasing these Tap shoes were a gamble, but using the sizing guide was great. They fit perfectly with a little room for growth!"
65583,1,i was looking everywhere for a deal and found the m VERY CHEAP priced here. overall the shoes look very cool and are extremely light. im used to vans shoes that feel heavy on the feet but these shoes are very light and thin as if walking on air. i like them so far. not bad at all.
278226,1,Very comfortable. I'm waiting for winter too fully enjoy the comfort.Hopefully it will survive the approaching cold weather. Yes do buy.
327159,0,I receive this boots in size 6 and I have to returned and buy the size 7 sizes runs small
282399,2,"The right boot had a fold in the inner liner of the leather upper, digging in to a toe. There is also a defect of the finish on the leather right at the tip of the toe. I am returning the boots. Quality control should be better for such obvious flaws. Made in China."
329414,1,"I bought these boots since a friend has the same pair and I was looking for a nice weathered looking leather (Bay Apache) that absolutely had a leather sole so the boot can be repaired in the future.Still breaking the boots in, but I know the leather will become nice and soft. Should last for many years to come.In terms of style, these are a kind of subtle boot since if you are wearing jeans, they just kind of look like leather shoes which was the look I was going for.I have seen higher quality boots, but they tend to cost a few hundred dollars. For daily wear, this pair is great."
109906,1,Comfortable shoe and cute. Had to stretch as was a bit too tight but perfect now.
354428,1,"This is my fourth pair of Lazers.It's a great shoe if you have foot problems like bunions, hammer toes and pain in the ball of the foot. The negative heel takes the weight off the ball and the soft ""suede"" allows for give and does not rub sensitive areas.I have been able to do serious walking since I discovered these shoes. I just wish I could get the dark blue in my size again. Apparently not made anymore? I do love my ""blue suede shoes."""
318646,1,I just purchased a pair of these shoes to replace some exactly like them that I have worn every day since 1994!! Those have reached the point where the heels are so run down that they make me walk a bit crooked and one sole is nearly worn through. But can you believe that kind of service from a pair of shoes? They are so comfortable from the first day of wearing and like a well known bunny the just keep going and going. I can't reccommend highly enough.
14794,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
26015,1,"This really is the best shoe I have found for training on pavement. It is very cushioned, and I notice less leg pain than with the various kinds I was trying before these. It wears like iron - I get probably 50% more life than from a pair than from other trainers I have used. Part of that is due to the fact that the uppers are still made with real animal hides, not synthetic. I put 600 miles on my last pair and visually it looked almost brand new.Oh, the best part: they're one of the few shoes still made in the USA by American workers."
103904,1,"For fashion sneakers, Skechers continues to impress. These shoes look great and are very comfortable as well."
360397,0,"I ordered a half-size larger, in response to reviews here, and that was good advice. But alas, one shoe was larger than the other, even though marked the same size. Amazon, as always, was great about the return. Apart from that, it's a fun shoe at a good price."
194978,1,"This is my 3rd pair & if I didn't wear them doing everything - including yard work, I wouldn't have to order new ones. Not to mention my basset hound liked the material and chewed one up. I love these shoes and replaced them because I wear them so much - very comfortable too."
156940,1,I bought these for my husband and he loooooves them. Once they are broken in they are extremely comfy not to mention convenient!
49274,1,"When I was a kid in the 70s, there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out, but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards, either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings. Those sneakers were great for any sport, they held up under abuse, and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike. These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design, and come in a wide variety of cuts, colors & materials. I've got several pairs of low-cuts, one pair in suede with natural (translucent brown) rubber toe, another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber, and this pair, shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber. There are a variety of color combinations to pick from, in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile. They are some of the toughest, well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well. They're the ultimate casual weekend shoe, and the most recent ones I've gotten come with a lighter, shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert, giving better support. I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too, and honestly, the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands. They can stand up to serious abuse, especially the ones made out of leather."
230378,1,"I purchased these boots to replace a pair of burlys that were quite old; they had cracked along the top of the foot near the ankle. My husband uses them to slosh through the hilly woods on particularly soggy days as well as for wading in streams. I am told they are completely waterproof, quite comfy, have awesome traction and the fit is mostly true to size. They maybe run a fraction big, so to be a perfect fit when wearing thick socks. He's very happy with these boots. My father has been wearing LaCrosse boots for as long as I can remember and these latest boots continue in the tradition. I didn't give them a 5 for a purely girlie minor detail. I think some people might roll their eyes now, but here goes, they smell bad. Despite the advertising that they are scent free, it took a couple weeks of airing out to get rid of the rubber boot smell. It doesn't matter so much for us, but if you are planning to use them for hunting I would recommend buying them early so that they have time to lose that smell. Otherwise they are perfect!"
267867,1,This was the best out there for the money. Bought them for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. Very water proof after playing in the snow with the kids...
339043,1,"I've always been sceptical when buying any clothing and footwear online. I've always wanted a pair of Chuck's. Got these, tried them on and I love them!"
316626,0,I bought this for my husband to wear as work shoes as he is standing all day and he needs ankles support. The leather and manufacture seems pretty flimsy and smells really bad. And not like leather but like chemicals. The inside lining looks cheap. Too bad I bought two pairs.
245838,2,"IT SEEMS LOSING A RETURN TICKET FOR THIS COMPANY IS A MAJOR ERROR. I DID SO AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CLEAR THE MATTER WITH THEM SINCE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I STILL HAVE THE SHOES AND TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR RETURNING THEM/"
190149,2,"This shoe is narrow across the toes, and definitely needs a better arch support. I'm truly disappointed with this shoe, but wanted an all white leather tennis shoe."
112405,1,I bought these sandals to replace an old faithful pair of keens I bought several years ago that finally had to be retired. Keens are comfortable and durable. Highly recommended!! I have several pair.
174513,2,"I ordered these shoes not only because their adorable, but I love the pale pink color. When I opened the box yesterday I found that they are bright, hot pink, not the pale pink that is pictured. I'm pretty sure that this is the new color that Minnetonka uses, but I thought that since I was buying from Amazon, it would be the color advertised. I am returning them and now looking at sites like ebay to find the pale pink color."
312836,1,This was a gift. It arrived on time for my 80 something year old grandmother's birthday. Even she thinks they are comfortable.
104664,1,These are the best flats I've ever owned! I've actually worn out my old ones and am looking desperately for another pair! Anyone know where these are still sold?
331224,1,Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
25370,2,I WANTED THE BLACK 9WEST PUMPS. AFTER I PLACED THE ORDER AND REALIZED I IMMEDIATELY CALLED AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SHE INSISTED THAT I ORDERED THE BLACK EVEN THOUGH THE COLOR SAID NATURAL. SO I HAD TO GO ON VACATION WITHOUT THE BLACK PUMPS THAT I WANTED.
191581,1,I purchase this sandals for my mother. She likes this sandals because they are very soft and easy to put on. Also the leather is very soft and comfortable.
5924,0,"My 6 yr old daughter loves these shoes! we got the black and fushsia, & although very pretty to look at, not to practical for school! the front of her shoes have become pretty tattered with the sequins falling off. She is pretty active, but still wants to be girlie, so I thought these would be perfect with the sneaker type sole! And they are, except for the diminishing sequins pieces! More for pictures or dressier affairs!"
4109,1,"These boots are some of the most comfortable that I've ever worn. Even after being on my feet for more than 6 hours my feet felt good. The boots are very warm which is kind of a draw back since I live in Las Vegas. However, after a day of work I was pleasantly surprised to find my socks were still dry. These would probably be best suited for cold climate hiking, but they work pretty good in the desert. Well worth the money."
324838,1,"converse are so back!! these shoes are the best ever because they're comfertable to run in(or walk..), totally durable!!(they're washable canvas!!), and completely kool! beleive me about this stuff cause i have four pairs, and all of my friends have them, and we all love them so much!! converse come in all the colors under the sun, and kool prints like camo! if you were thinking about getting these but hesitated, go ahead! they are perfect to wear with any outfit: punk, shopping, date, or even to prom! one girl at my school did, and it looked really good! you definitly won't regret your purchase!!"
344075,1,"While I'm not the one wearing them, they certainly are attractive and classic in style. Build quality appeared good. We are actually going to laser engrave on the side of the canvas part to customize for a friend. They will be Supah cool!"
204845,1,"First off, I'm not really a kid, but I don't want to sign up for an acount. Know that. I bought a pair a couple months ago. They obviously get kudos in the cool facter right off the bat. Then I put them to the real test. On the court. They are super comfortable and are still holding up great. They also breathe very well.This brings me to the only problems. Soon after I bought a pair, my friend did too. He plays in them not only on the hard-court, but on the black top when he's practicing also. Therefore he uses them A LOT. A few days ago one of the air pumps in the sole sprung a leak and his right shoes rim no longer spins. I've only heard of this happening to a couple people, but if you abuse your shows as much as my friend does, you might want to look else where. Also the sound of the pump is audible. Not terribly noticable, expecialy on the court.All in all, this is a great shoe and really encourage you buying it. Whether you want it for hoops or for style, it's sick no matter what."
61818,1,"Before my purchase I read all the rave review's about this boot. I'm now in total agreement with everyone else. This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn. After one week I bought a second pair (Black & Brown). I work in a casual dress office and, they look great!"
109964,1,I have owned these sandals before and just love how comfortable they are. I have tried very hard to find ones to compare with being as comfortable when wearing to do shopping and to do anything for a long time. I would definitely recommend them for comfort and durability.
16785,1,I love these cleats. I just bought my third pair of them. I play an average of 2-3x a week in different leagues and pickup games and each pair has lasted 2-3 years. I keep buying them for a reason; they are the best cleats I've ever worn. Comfortable with great touch and durable enough that I don't mind how often I need to replace them.
151043,1,"excellent product, I really liked'm very pleased with the purchase. . . . . . . . . . ."
9316,0,I bought them thinking they would be like my keds I've own for sometime. The are called the original. They looked the same unless you get really close and see the inside isn't terry cloth they are cheaper made. I bought a med it is what I wear but i'm in the process of trying to stretch them out. Wetting them and putting them over objects to stretch them since they are so tight. Length is right but they are narrow now with wetting them the blue from the soles have come up and i'll now have to deal with that. So what can I say - could have returned them you have always been great but thought I could stretch them out since i've been unable to find the ked original in the store.
283690,1,These grasshopper shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The sole of the shoe is cushiony and you almost feel like you are walking on air. I was a bit concerned about the light color (they only had beige available at the time of purchase). There was a little bit of dirt on the shoes and it wiped them off lightly with some warm water. I would definitely recommend these shoes especially for summer and the warmer months.
353952,0,"I'm not a runner really and I bought this shoe so I can play tennis, but I can definitely tell the difference between the feeling from the shoe and my old pair of Asics. The Asics GEL technology is definitely nice and feels more dynamic upon ground impact. The Mercury trainer shoe seems to have these columns at predetermined impact points. It does add a little bounce to the run; also when I first wore them I noticed my gait changed a bit probably from the impact columns. I think it's pretty elevated at the heel but it's not too bad after you get use to it. Perhaps this is the effect of a cross trainer design, but I wouldn't know. Looks like a SHOX copy.I would probably stick with an Asics."
317719,1,"These crocs are just perfect for my little one on the go. He is 13 months and wearing shoes for the first time. He hated other shoes, but these are so light and comfie that he has not fussed and runs around in them happily. I highly recommend crocs for little toddlers on the go!"
168064,1,"My mother has severe foot problems. Her &#34;hammer toe&#34; would rub against the top of the shoe, creating blisters, etc., so she finally stopped wearing shoes altogether. This meant, of course, she didn't leave the house. We finally found these shoes with the deeper toe-well, and she's out and about once again! Fantastic!"
166052,0,"Son buenos ahora pense que podian ser como los SAS, si esa son las espectativas no los compres , ahora como zapato comun no estan mal"
152064,1,Very comfortable and very true to size. Shoe is easy to slip on and off and very good looking with jeans
76948,0,"I guess I will be keeping this pair, I need them for an event and it's too late to go looking elsewhere. It's seems comfortable--basic style and for women like me who can't tolerate heels, it's a nice dress option. But it's advertised on Amazon as leather and it's not leather, nor is it going to fool anyone."
216907,1,I ordered these shoes for my son who is a Crossfit Trainer. He wears a size 13 shoe so this is what I ordered. When the shoes arrived they were at least 2 sizes too large. My son said that they measured at least a size 14/15. I had to return them. So if you are ordered these remember that they run very large.
103737,1,Bought these shoes at a Friday sale. Great value. They fit perfectly and are quite comfortable. Stylish too!
168382,1,Lovely shoes! Sturdy and so sexxy... I would highly recommend. Of course a shoe of this height is not for the faint of heart
177060,1,I was traveling and I realized a need for something to be comfortable while out on an assignment that would not require trekking out to the local mall. I found a very comfortable casual shoe that is also very attractive at a great price. I cannot say enough about how comfortable this shoe is. The combination of ordering it via Amazon and getting it the next day was a much more pleasurable drill than parking at the mall an shopping for hours... I should also mention that I bought it via my Kindle Fire also purchased on Amazon. Technology via shoe leather (well rubber compound soles) meets the road.
199754,1,"I finished a marathon on this pair of shoes - and I don't think I could have done it without them! I used to use a Reebok prior until 2009, which I thought was the best shoes on earth (bought the same model twice). But when I tried running on these shoes for the first time in 2010, I fell in love. Long distance running never felt so light and easy! Since then I only buy Asics. I bought another model last year, it was okay but not as good as this one - so I think my next purchase would definitely be this exact same pair!"
145017,0,"Because of issues of authenticity, I wrote to SHOE PLANET if these UGG is fake or not. This is their reply:""We only sell authentic merchandise and we are an authorized dealer to sell UGG'S. I understand your concern however, I can assure you that these came directly from the UGG manufacturer. I would recommend only buying from reputable sellers through web sites that you have heard of such as Amazon. There are guidelines that we are required to follow to prove the items are authentic.

98573,1,"This is sooooooooooooo great!!!!!!! Cleats are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so glad I bought these Cleats!!!!! The Cleats are lightweight and are very comfortable, it feels I run 10 times faster!!"
166536,1,I can definitely recommend these shoes to anyone! Leather is very soft and the ComforTech features make it a comfortable shoe.
90466,1,"Great shoes. My son loves them, and they aren't easy for him to pull off. Once his feet got a little bigger, it did get harder to get the shoes on his feet, since you have to stretch the shoe opening *just* the right way. They are super comfortable for him though, and he loves walking in them."
9993,1,"These boots are great quality! I bought them for my dad who is a police officer and he loves them. He said they were hard to break in, but really good quality. I had to return them several times because of the tricky E vs EE sizing. We got it figured out and he loves his new boots."
27127,1,Skechers Men's Seige Lace Looped OxfordExcellent product recominedo 100 % from Caracas - Venezuela.Excelente producto lo recominedo 100% desde Caracas-Venezuela.
257113,1,"I am on my fifth pair of these sandals, yes 5th. pair!! they are the BEST!!!! Bought my first pair in Old Branson, Missouri and in love with them ever since,hope they never discontinue these planning on purchasing another pair,like to have an extra pair on hand!!!"
67919,1,True to size and are very comfortable right out of the box so no painful breaking in the boots. I work all day on my feet and do not experience any discomfort at the end of my shift. Highly recommend.
232699,1,THESE ARE ADOREABLE. i was surprised at how cheap they were. i can dress these up or down. go with almost anything. extremely confortable. buy buy buy !
329607,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
146588,1,These was purchased as a gift for my Mom who raves about how comfortable these sneakers are. A Great buy!!!!
8305,1,"Great item, it is excelent for gift or any event you made, i totaly recommend it, i just love it."
306357,1,"I originally bought this shoe for running on a treadmill, but after I tried them on I loved them! Now I where them everywhere I go! They are so comfortable. I have really high arches, and had read that these worked great for those kinds of feet. They do for awhile, but after a long day of walking in them, the top of my right arch began to ache from rubbing on the tongue of the shoe; thats why I rated it a 4 instead of a 5. Other than that I just love them...they are stylish, comfortable on the soles of your feet, and just what I was looking for!"
195923,1,"At less than $13, this is an amazing gift for a sister, mom, aunt or bff who has a casual, classy style. My order arrived FAST. The bag is very high quality, the stitching amazing, the color lighter than pictured, yet perfect for both holiday and year round use. The tote is neither too large or small, has loads of pockets for organization, and the handles are long enough (and soft enough)to wear comfortably as a shoulder bag.My family is scaling back on overall gift giving this year by agreement of everyone, and this gift ""looks"" as though I spent much more money than I did. I'll tuck a dollar store coupon organizer into it, but you could add the matching, zip top wallet for an expensive look on a budget as well... or tuck a small bottle of her favorite perfume in a pocket. The beautiful quilted tote is gift-able on its own. Very happy with my purchase!"
175646,1,I now own five pairs!!! All in different colors! Hope they never stop selling them!
46413,0,"These shoes were very comfortable, but made too much noise while walking. An air pocket formed and caused a sound with each step. I have poorly formed feet so it is probably more a problem with my feet than the shoes. I wish they didn't do that because they were so comfortable."
182294,1,These are terrific flip flops. They have good arch support and the soles haven't squished down like other brands of flip flops I've had. I've been wearing them almost daily for months and they're practically like new.
245876,0,"Shoe looks a bit more boot like than I anticipated.Fit wise, it runs true to size. Top of the shoe rubs my ankle bone some and is uncomfortable; I hope that goes away over time as the shoe breaks in. I probably wouldn't buy this shoe again, but will wear it until they are worn out."
83325,1,this is my second pair of reefs after finally deciding after 8 years that I should add a new pair. I love them!
359651,1,so very comfortable . light weight . just a little too wide even for more wide feet . but very wearable . i have plantar fasciitis and these clogs are very good at alleviating the discomfort
103121,1,Real ballet shoes at a reasonable price. We bought them for Christmas for our 3 budding prima ballerina granddaughters. They were ecstatic. They danced the day away. It made for a very Merry Christmas.
348760,1,"Wearing a AAAA shoe, it is very difficult to find a nice shoe in such widths. I have purchased several pairs of this shoe in many colors over the years. Goes with both skirts and pants. Just wish it came in silver!"
380241,0,The shoe is nice but they run really small. I am not sure if this is how dance shoes are supposed to fit but I wear a size 9. So I bought a size 9..they were tight so I exchanged them for a 9.5...they are still tight in the toe area. Be careful!!
141431,1,"For years I considered Birkenstocks to be the shoe for nerds, and wouldn't even think of wearing them. Then one summer I was on my feet all day at the Minnesota State Fair, walking 12+ hours on concrete without a break, when I happened across a booth selling Birkenstocks. My feet were throbbing, so just for the heck of it I tried on a pair. They felt wonderful! I was an instant convert, and bought them on the spot. As I continued walking around the fair, it felt like I was getting a foot massage with every step, and my feet were renewed for more miles of walking.Now I wear my Birkenstocks all the time, except when I HAVE to wear dress shoes for work.Give them a try - I think you will be pleasantly surprised, as I was."
121369,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
320251,1,"I really like these! They are super comfortable and move nicely. However, sizing information is super confusing. The size chart is confusing so I looked to reviews for help. They were even more confusing. I ended up buying my street shoe size, and they are just a little too big. I probably could've gotten away with a 5 1/2 (I wear a 6). But other than that they are great!"
130262,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
32462,1,"My son loves to be a cowboy. He can't wait to go back to Wild West City for our annual trip. He wanted a new pair of cowboy boots, and even at 9. many stores consider his foot size to be that of a man. Locally, a pair of cowboy boots for him may have cost me over $100. We decided to look online. We found a pair that was reasonable and ordered them. Everyday he anxiously awaited his purchase. They arrived in the amount of time promised. He was so excited when he opened the box and they were all they said they would be. He was absolutely thrilled and they immediately went on his feet and the fit was excellent (I ordered them 1 to 1/2 size larger than what he is wearing so that he will have room and not outgrow them immediately). The styling is really nice and the quality great. What a deal!"
289229,1,Product received promptly and was exactly as expected. Was a repeat purchase of product I liked and the price was right.
318205,1,"i have been wanting these boots for the past three years now and i have finly got them, they are everthing i wanted. i have been climbing trees and my spikes are rubbing on my legs for now on they can rub on my boots and save my legs. thanks to company."
239264,2,"Be warned, I was shipped a wide shoe even though my order said nothing about it being a wide(W). If you buy this item, check the size right away and make sure it is what you ordered."
342462,0,I've ordered this shoe before and was a little disappointed that the quality was not consistent. I love the style and heel height works well for me.
174286,1,6 N is a hard to find shoe size. This white sandal was perfect in every way. It's exactly what I was looking for !!
282850,0,These are great shoes once your toddler is truly toddling. They are hard rubber soles and great for outside time. They are not slipper-like. A bit clunky looking.
378035,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
58949,1,I wore these to school (as a teacher I am on my feet all day). Best shoe I have bought for school and at a reasonable price. I have bad knees and need something with cushioning and support. At the end of 4 days my knees hurt much less than usual and these shoes breathe enough so my feet weren't sweaty.
168851,1,"These shoes are great. Stability when walking. Size/fit are true. I would recommend these shoes for all walkers, but especially for those like me, a senior citizen whose daily exercise is mainly walking. I had purchased a white pair last year and was very pleased with them so I bought these black ones to wear in the winter."
14249,1,"I bought four pair of these in different colors. They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies! ;-) I have long, narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well. I am absolutely delighted with them."
174251,0,"Let me preface this review by saying that I've owned these shoes for several years and they have been among favorite casual shoes. Although the uppers and outsoles have held up remarkably well, the sort of honeycomb midsole has disintegrated - the material has basically turned to what appears like ground coffee, making them unwearable. I don't know what caused this; they're not worn constantly nor are they worn in wet or other extreme conditions. I'll probably try to contact Clarks to see if they have an explanation or an offer of adjustment."
345253,1,I bought these Chuck's for my daughter and they were a perfect fit. The turnaround time was excellent! I will continue to purchase from this vendor :)
303512,1,"Caterpillar boots are all I wear! I'm a pipe fitter so they have to stand up to a harsh environment daily, and they just that! I also would recommend the Endure series boots from Cat. You'll be very pleased if you buy these!"
256702,1,"These shoes are inexpensive, light weight, and very comfortable.They were hard to get on at first. There is a loop on the tongue that holds the laces... I relaced the shoes without using the loop and they went on much easier.I'm happy with them."
80779,1,"The best shoes ever, but if you use coverse.com to buy your shoes prepair for the SLOWEST loading site you have ever experienced! Many times I didn't buy shoes because of the speed of their site. I have really fast internet and their site is by far the slowest of any site I use. If you have the patients you can't beat the shoes (I always use the create your own) I have created some really unique shoes."
96638,2,"cloth on bottom sole not good for hardwood floors, knobs on bottom of sole with cloth glued to them offers even less area for grip. doubt the knobs will be comfortable, but time will tell. solid build and warm for ankle and once fabric on sole wears out and offers some grip (what where they thinking?) it might be comfortable but will definately be warm, if it doesnt make feet sweat...(just got them so unknown, but looks like the dearforms inner fabric, sorta.) if not for the knobs and cloth on bottom, this could get a five."
212328,1,These shoes are even better looking in person. They are very high quality for a very low price!
167425,1,"I cant give a detailed review of the shoe itself, because I never received my order. I ordered a pair thru Amazon, and the seller was ShoeMall. Within a few days, my order was canceled because the shoe was no longer available. I have had another experience similar to this with ShoeMall.To comment on the shoe itself, I tried a pair of Traveltime sneakers on in a store, at the end of a long shopping day. My aching feet felt like they were walking on pillows! I couldn't believe how comfortable they were. I didnt purchase any at that time but wish I had!!"
161698,1,I just couldn't ask for a better pair of shoe than this. The fit is perfect. The leather uppers are just a jo to behold. They have remained shiny and clean the past 6 months that I have been using them. I am just hooping that French Shriner could come up with more shoe styles to choose from. Also this particular design doesn't come in saddle brown nor tan. Wish they'd make more colors of the design. Just love it!!!
352499,1,"I wish this shoe was still in production. I originally bought two pairs about 10 years ago when I used to skateboard. I don't skate anymore but I've wanted these shoes again ever since. They don't make shoes like this anymore, it's got more padding and comfort than any other shoe I've ever worn. I'm so glad to have these back on my feet and they are just as amazing as I remembered. I probably won't be able to get another pair after this so it will be a sad day when I have to retire this pair. Thankfully these shoes last forever, especially when you aren't using them for skateboarding."
129398,1,"The size is right, and the sole has good cushion. It hurts in between the toes in the beginning because it has an edge(like a seam of plastic), but think I will get used to it eventually."
154249,1,"I bought my first Dan Post boots in 2004, and they have held in great shape. I bought this pair now in black to go with my business suits. They're not as light and smooth as my other ostrich boots, but they are just as comfortable. They go great with dark suits, so if you're looking for a pair at a good price, I definitely recommend these."
160010,1,"The shoe fit me well, and it came in the original condition - no damages, and it came on time."
182060,1,Purchased these same farm boots years ago and they lasted a long time gardening and working in the yard. The pair I purchased recently seem to be the same quality. They definately are comfortable and the fit is great.
4627,1,"I know this isn't the most helpful review but I would justlike to concur with the other reviews. I have had these bootsfor a year now and except for a few scuffs, they still are ingreat condition."
257173,1,"Reebok its that I want. You can wear those everywhere during the day. But they run small maybe for a number. I use to wear 9, but they didn't feet in my feet. so Think about this if you are going to buy these shoes."
288046,1,"the shoes came quickly, and my feet are 100 % better now. I have had bad heels for a few months and the shoes took my pain away in less than an hour. they are great! Now I need to look for a winter shoe so I can walk all winter too. The best shoe for heel problems I have ever found."
44572,1,Very happy customer. My feet are somewhat wide and full so I was pleased these shoes fit comfortably right out of the box. I bought an 8.
40817,1,I walk 12 NYC blocks each way for my every day commute and have worn these all summer long. They are great for me bc I have a very high arch and not many flip flops have any arch support. Before I got these I was getting shin splints if I walked too fast. These flip flops are comfortable and I wear them everywhere!
337314,1,First time shoe buyer via internet. Purchased because I'd worn Propet before and was pleased with fit. Not disappointed! The fit was perfect and shoes delivered in a timely way.
9014,1,I loved the way the flats looked like in Amazon.com only when they arrived it didn't look as I thought they would when I wore them. They are pretty and comfortable and that's what counts plus it's a good bargain.
12351,1,So glad they make them in a size 16.. I do wish there was a larger selection to choose from but after size 13 the selections naturaly dwindle.
239321,1,"These shoes are comfortable and practical. They are a great, simple work shoe when my feet need a break. They go with just about anything."
287270,1,"About 10 years ago my feet started to complain due to irritated nerves (people with diabetes understand); orthotics helped; sneakers helped too but I needed dressier shoes too. These shoes, in black, did the trick. I've tried many others, with some success, but these shoes win the prize. I buy 3 pairs at a time and rotate them - the older pairs for casual/rough wear and the newest pair goes into the courtroom (lawyers are people too, mostly). If I ever hear they are being discontinued, I may rent storage space so I can buy out the stock in my size. I own 1 pair of dressy shoes that I can wear 2 or 3 hours; but for 15 hour days, there is no substitute. Like white shirts, these shoes simplify shopping and wardrobe selection."
114637,1,"I got this ballet shoes for my 4 year old, she loved them but you really have to buy one or even two sizes bigger,I ended up buying 2 pairs because the first ones were too small for her. So make sure you buy 1 or 2 sizes bigger, they grow so fast anyway!! The shoes are very soft and it has an elastic band to make them fit their feet."
136670,1,"These all black Chuck's are my favorite All Star model ! It is no small task to find them at a regular retail store-most often your best bet is to buy online. They shipped in a timely fashion. Great Kicks, good deal."
201220,1,These are great shoes. Shoebuy was prompt in shipping them and you cannot beat the price. If you love boat shoes then Sperry is the only way to go...
310563,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
334136,1,"I haven't had a pair of Wallabees since I was in high school, but happening upon a Clark's ad brought them back to mind. I ordered a pair, and am glad I did. Next to my Clark's Desert Boots and my Birkies, these are the most comfortable shoes I own. I teach, and as such am on my feet all day. My Wallabees make the concrete floor a little less hard."
313652,1,"I am currently playing premiere club soccer and I have been looking for a good shoe forever. I have narrow feet and weak ankles. These shoes were great. They fit right and were the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn.Since they are made of soft kangaroo leather there is no need to break them in. They provide excellent feel on the ball.CON- you must treat the leather and keep it soft or else the leather will crack. The toes wore out on my shoes from dragging my toe so just remember to treat the leather often.As a piece of advice, wait until the price drops to around $80 to save $$. This usually happens when a new model comes out.GREAT SHOE! HIGHLY RECOMENDED!"
362726,1,"I'm wearing these bad boys right now. These sneakers have a sexy look to them, and you can't go wrong with classic chucks at this price. Buy them! Every one should have black and white sneakers in their collection. They feel great, and I haven't had any problems with them yet. This is well worth the purchase. :-)"
18035,1,A great product which i like very much and like all the different styles and colours and different textures and prices
146977,0,I took a chance and purchased these as a Christmas gift. When I bought them I was not 100% sure they were real UGGs or not. When I contacted UGG they told me this company is not an authorized dealer and cautioned me that these might be knock-offs. When they arrived I noticed that these boots were made in China. I found that there are several dealers selling a lot of these on the internet and they are shipped from China. According to UGG and other sources (Norton for one)they are selling counterfeit boots. Bottom line is that so far these appear to be of good quality but I am still unsure if they are the real deal or knock-offs that are over priced.
276853,0,I have had several pairs of these boots over the years and liked them. The most recent pair had a manufacturing defect that was biting thre inside of my left ankle. I had to lace them so loose that the support was inadequate. I guess with Chinese children making boots you can't expect perfection.
12225,1,"This was the second time we ordered Pink Converse Shoes for my daughter, the first time I didn't get the size right. I returned them to ""Shoes R Us"" I think it was called and they took care of my mistake very quickly. Unfortunately they didn't have the size I needed so I ordered a replacement pair from Last Pairs. They came quickly, fit perfectly and were reasonably priced, the same as our local mall, without the hassle! Very good experience overall, would recommend."
2844,1,"I have owned over 8 pairs of these boots.They are well made,comfortable to wear as soon as they are taken out of the box and waterproof.They fit true to size.I highly recommend them to anyone that wants a great boot at a great value."
158228,1,"hella cool chucks..theyre not cheap, good quality..i was satisfied and so would you be...one minor problem is that purple passion (which is the one i ordered) wasnt the exact color as the one shown...but its still cool!! i love them"
132058,1,"These are classics! But dont buy any, cuz I want to be the only awesome person in the world."
302252,1,"They came in a timely manner, in the little Converse box. They're just as the should be: classic kicks that will last a long time."
107178,0,"I had been looking for an SAS outlet online without success, and found these shoes which looked VERY similar, but cost about $40 less. I decided to try a pair and they are pretty comfortable but much tighter than the SAS shoes. I use a 9W in SAS and ordered a 9 C/D in the Softspot version, although the box they came in was labeled as the same size as 9W, the same size as the SAS. The Softspot shoe is smaller and tighter than the SAS, so next time I will order a wider or bigger size."
278458,1,I looked all over for these shoes found them at a great price and love them so much and will buy another pair very soon as these ones are almost destroyed
172811,1,"My son loves these shoes. This is the fourth pair we've bought. He swears there is nothing better for all around wear. They look nice. They last, even through Marching Band season. And they are really comfortable - that's saying something for my son with the Fred Flintstone feet."
137434,1,"As far as I'm concerned, this shoe is perfect. I bought the black with white laces. I can wear it every day, it's cute, it's comfortable, and it's inexpensive. It goes great with capris, boot cut jeans, skinny jeans, and slimfit pants. You can wear them with or without socks, but I prefer the liners (no shows) with these. I'll admit that I'm newer to the Keds brand as an adult and so I can't comment on how much more comfortable they used to be ""back in the day."" I wore this brand as a kid and to me they feel exactly the same as they once did. I've probably become pickier in my older age and I still find these to have adequate support though they are quite thin. I had been buying Vans brand shoes that look very similar to these for years, but was getting tired of paying $50 for them. I don't know how long these will last, but seeing as they are inexpensive, I won't mind if I only get a year or so out of them. One more quick note: these are very feminine for such a plain shoe. They're thin and make my feet look a little bit smaller than they really are. I don't have big feet (7.5), but I still like the effect."
192713,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
206508,1,"I really like these, and of course as i get them, the east coast is slammed with bad weather, but i love when i actually do wear them. However, i recommend some high and tight socks, the opening tends to pull my socks down."
40514,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
70921,1,I was worried these would be flipflops for the ultra skinny...meaning if you weigh over120lbs. you'll crush them and slip off of them lol but they are great strong flipflops andavery cute...I ended up getting another pair. I have one by the sliding glass doors and oneby another door out to the deck...so that I have something to slip on my feet when I need to runoutside....very comfy too and fast service!! And the PalmtreesGreen pair is really a great color for the summer too!
7349,1,This is the best shoe I've found for comfort regarding my plantar fasciitis. They provide excellent arch support too. I throw them in the washer and air dry them. This is my fourth pair.
307820,1,These shoes are great for the price. They are light and they let your feet breathe easily. Only con is there is no arch support so after wearing the for a while my feet hurt badly.
386221,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
369929,1,"I'm on my third pair of these and still couldn't be happier with them. They're incredibly lightweight and comfortable. There's a reason why they're so popular with people who are on their feet a lot. Like other purchasers have noted, they can be more than a little squeaky. But for a quick fix, all you have to do is remove the insert of the shoe and dust it with baby powder on the bottom before replacing it in the shoe. This will greatly reduc,e if not eliminate any friction which is the cause of the squeaking sound."
381061,1,Third time was the charm for these boots. I finally got a full size larger than my usual and they worked beautifully! Great boots. Love 'em.
1200,0,relatively comfortable. The front of my ankle hurts if i lace it too tightly. We will see if this improves with breaking it in.
224415,1,"I ordered the ""Chuck Taylor"" Converse All Stars in Black, just because I think they go with almost everything. The packaging was fine and I had no issues with the product. It arrived before the projected date and looked exactly like the photo. The box did include two pairs of laces, both black and white. I've been wearing Converse Chuck Taylors for years and needed to replace my pair that I've worn out. I rotate my shoes, so they had just ran their course. I really enjoy these shoes, I like the look, the style (which is very classic), and the comfort. These are the most recognized sneaker, ever. More people comment on these more than any other pair that I own. The only drawback is that they run large. Make sure when you order them, you order them to your true size. Other than that, I have had no issues. YMMV."
278819,1,"Not sure how many years now that I have purchased this boot. I had very painful feet because of plantar fascitis, and was recomended ,by my Dr.,to get a good sturdy supportive shoe. Went to the outlet mall near me and asked for a good boot that would support my ankles and help with the foot issue and put good orthotics inside them. This is what they had me try and they are comfortable, supportive, warm enough for winter, cool enough for the summer. I now buy a pair every time I need new shoes. I am a Farrier so I wear them a lot and they support my feet well. The planter fascitis does not bother me when using this boot with an orthotic which is not a pricy one"
74868,1,"I love these sandals and have ordered them over the internet for many years. They are basically my favorite shoe and I order them in many colors. I fear that they are being phased out, as they are getting hard for me to find now."
323566,1,"I have been wearing this shoe for about 25-30 years (work and play) and have found it to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I spend a lot of time on my feet and the arch support is fantastic. Additionally, I have a wide foot and tennis shoes can be hard to find in wide sizes.Now for the down side. This shoe used to be manufactured in the UK and was available through local merchants such as Kohl's. Unfortunately, most of the ones available in the US now come from Vietnam and are only available online - at least in my area. The quality is not quite as good as it use to be and I have found that the sizes do not run true to form and I have to order a half size larger than what I wear in most shoes. Since I do have to order them on line I usually order multiple pairs at a time and a pair will normally last me about 8 months with continuous wear. The last time I ordered, prior to ordering through Amazon, I ordered three pair. Two of the pairs fit just fine but the third pair was miss-labeled and was undersized. I had to take them to a shoe shop and have them streatched but,even with that, it took a month or longer to get them broken in to where they were wearable. I would have sent them back but I had already worn out the other two pair prior to putting these on and it was too late to return them.Over all, this is a very nice shoe and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a wide shoe with decent arch support but I would STRONGLY suggest that you try on EVERY PAIR you receive right after you get them to make sure they are the right size."
340967,0,"These look better in the picture, and I was expecting the heels to be a higher, but they're very comfortable shoes. You can walk all day in them."
121851,2,"Horrible quality, completely fell apart in 6 months. Broke in, and realized they also make your feet smell like dirty dogs a** if .you get them wet. *note, when wet you will slip and slide.all over the place in addition to the foul smell that will present itself.More about the quality; front toe strap partially disconnected @ 4 months, side lower connection shortly thereafter. Cannot believe such catastrophic failures from what is supposed to be a good manufacture. I guess that's why I will be going back to purchasing only rainbow or olulukai sandles as Reef has gone gimmick over quality.* on that note, be careful! The novel placement of metal ""church key"" beer opener in the slippers arch can cause you to lose control and eat serious s#$t when descending stairs, ladders etc, especially wood or metal! ""Stay on your toes"" so to speak!"
352901,1,I just love these shoes - I purchased a pair a couple of years ago and I should of bought them in all of the colors that they came in but I didn't and now I am sorry - they are true to size and feel as though you are wearing slippers. Wish I could find more of these because I would purchase more.
367990,1,"I like every product from Teva, it is really comfortable for everyday walking. The style is very casual though...but i am student, it's fine for me to wear casual sandal to school everyday."
227139,1,"I love these shoes and have owned many Chuck Taylor Converse shoes for 30 years. I did forget that when getting this shoe I must order a size smaller than my regular shoe size. This can be frustrating when ordering shoes online, so don't forget to order 1size down :)"
72980,1,"I love Crocs. They're a great substitute for slippers around the house and you can wear them outside. Your feet stay cool and breathe. They won't get sweaty like they do in sneakers/tennis shoes. One warning: don't wear them on the treadmill. I didn't find they gave me enough support there, but they are great for casual wear around the house or running errands. They wear very well. I wear mine almost every day and have had them for 4 years. Might try some other styles in the Crocs brand."
254543,1,Its a black K-Swiss tennis shoe. This is a classic unisex style. I bought them for my 3 year old daughter. She loves them because daddy got em for her. I think I might get a pair for my self actually.Oh..and a pair for the wife too (maybe)
344604,0,"This is my first Sperry product. I wear boat shoes all the time, and have had problems with them smelling bad after several weeks of use without wearing socks. A friend suggested Sperry for their strange ability to not start stinking. Sure enough, he was right. These shoes do not develop stinky foot odors. I would rate them much lower if not for that fact.The reason for the negativity is the soles suck. They are slippery when wet. For example, I slip and slide over wet metal plates that they put on streets and sidewalks that are under construction. No other shoes do that. For a shoe called a boat shoe, they aren't good in wet conditions. Other Sperrys have different soles. These are pretty smooth on the bottom, so watch out for smooth bottom Sperrys. Another bad thing about the soles is they are too thin. You feel the road, so to speak.I might try another Sperry because of their mysterious non-stinky ability, but I'll make sure there's some texture to the bottom of the sole, and that its thicker than the one on these."
291561,1,Very pleased with the quality and the quick shipping. My grandson will love these as they look just like Grandpa's.
233934,1,A well built shoe for walking around or working out. I like that it does not have lots of goofy colors or textures like sports shoes have now a days. I've bought them before and will buy them again.
243663,1,"This is standard issue footwear for anyone who wants the ""look"" of indie rock (the others are t-shirts that look to be from a redneck bar circa 1978 but really came from a suburban Old Navy circa 2010 and those ""washed-out"" blue jeans that were purchased at the same Old Navy). The shoes are grossly unfit for any athletic activity (I don't know how the heck I survived playing street hockey in these things as a teenager), provide no protection against the cold or stepping on sharp objects, begin to smell horribly after 9+ months of use and have a tendency to have the sole tear away from the rest of the shoe after those 9 months (if the smell hasn't destroyed them yet). But their coolness factor will never, ever be replicated by any footwear, past, present or future (the Roman sandal gave them a run for their money in the 1980s by the garage punk band Thee Mighty Caesars, but that's another story). Everyone should own a pair of these shoes at least once in their lifetimes."
87947,1,Great shoe for my daughter's summer ballet class. Only negative is that the laces do not want to stay tied.
122289,1,I love this shoe rack. To assemble the rack was easy (just pop out the side). The racks are easily stackable. I could fit 3 pairs of women's shoes on one level or 2 pairs of men's + stacked flip flops on one level. I purchased a total of 4 and have room for more when I need it. The cheap metal/plastic racks are no comparison to this!
116751,1,My little ballerina just adores them. They are great quality for the price with a lovely inner lining and a tag to write your name. Don't need more at this stage...
96163,1,"I love these shoes! I had one pair and used them so much I was dreading having to get rid of the so I searched to find another pair since I had bought these so long ago, I was afraid they wer no longer available. Not only did I find them at amazon, but they were on sale and available with prime shipping. Need I say more. Ok maybe I will. They are comfortable and the patent leather on the top only dresses them up just enough but not too much."
255376,1,"I really liked these sandals....the fit was great, very cushy, and the price was awesome for this brand of shoes.......$7..."
112727,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
346719,1,I have had the chucks for about a month now and there holding up well. I like the look of them there comfortable and simple ill be wearing them for a long time! :) If you are thinking of buying some chuck T's i would there pretty cheap and they can withstand some wear amd tear! Five stars
132827,1,"I love these shoes. I am 44 and have spent the last 10 years dealing with back issues. I have had three back surgeries and have lingering foot, back, and mobility issues. These shoes are stable, supply great arch support, and have a deep heel register to really hold onto my foot. If I needed to there, is plenty of room to put my thick custom orthotics, but I don't need to. They have excellent support just as they are. They have a fun Mary Jane look that is so much better than most orthopaedic shoes. I wear them with pants and capris. They are a bit chunky for wearing with a skirt, but when my back is having a bad day, I have done it. I have these in black, grey, and brown."
248151,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
224860,1,"With Christmas looming, I ordered these blue Converse Lo Tops. They arrived immediately! Crisp, new and perfect fit for my daughter.The extra pair of navy shoelaces arrived two weeks later, separately. No problem, we all had a good laugh over the arrival of onepair of shoelaces, amidst all the flurry of Christmas packages. Thank you!"
92003,1,"I run marathons and various triathlon distances, and have done plenty of miles happily on Asics Kayanos. I was worried about the cushioning on such a lightweight shoe when I took them out of the box. But they run beautifully. They are so incredibly light it makes a noticeable difference to my running. Not sure how long they would last given their minimalist design, but I guess we tend to retire our shoes before there are any signs of wear & tear on the upper part of the shoe anyway. The only issue for me is the tongue design - yes the single-fold makes sense in a weight-saving capacity, and once the shoes are on there are no comfort issues (on the contrary they feel great), but if you do triathlons and need to do a fast transition, you need to spend a bit longer to make sure they are put on right. Nevertheless, they are still my new favorite running shoe. JK"
318103,0,"Although I love the style of this boot, my legs are slender and my foot is marginally narrow. The boot literally flops around my calf and my foot can't seem to find a comfort zone as the boot is too wide to accomodate my narrow foot. Otherwise, I love the style of this boot so will be content to wear it with a pair of socks for added comfort."
352336,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
360051,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
96707,1,"I bought my first pair when I was visiting New York. I was amazed from the quality and moreover from the comfort of a pair of shoes in this price range.The sole has excellent traction, and you can wear them in ""easy"" hikes.As for the look, since they're not overly ""sportive"", you can wear them even at the office.My first pair was tan, and contrary to the abuse it took, it never stained or discolored. Now it's beginning to show its age a little, but that is expected after all the daily wear for 10 months.Seriously, I wouldn't write a review if I wasn't overly pleased with this pair of shoes. A really good value for money...!!!"
289989,2,"I needed a decent pair of black dress shoes and I was in a pinch. I figured these would be a decent buy -- not expensive, replaceable soles, classic look bearing a classic brand name. The first time I wore them, they fit fine -- not tight across the top, my toe not butting up into the ends. They were a bit tight, which I attributed to the newness of the shoe. I was very wrong.I've worn these puppies close to 30 times and they feel no more broken in than the day I lifted them from the box. The do LOOK worn in, because they crease very easily and the leather is particularly low-grade. I have to keep a shoe brush in my office desk drawer to buff out the constantly visible scuff marks. And even with proper care, they collect water spotting like no other leather shoe I've seen. Perhaps I have high standards because my other pair of dress shoes are Allen Edmonds. But the Bostonian name is usually associated with quality, and these are anything but.Do yourself a favor and save up a couple hundred bucks and buy a nice dress shoe from an American manufacturer. They'll be very comfortable and last you a lifetime."
363197,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
94508,1,"These boots are great. I have always wanted a pair of black leather boots, and I wore them tonight (New Year's Eve) for the first time. People liked them a lot. I had tried these on in a store. I am usually a 6 or 6 1/2. I found the 6 to be snug and the 6 1/2 slipped way too much in the heel. I took the advice from another reviewer and ordered them in wide. I don't have wide feet, but these 6Ws fit really well with a thick sock. I wore them with skinny jeans, and it worked out quite well. When I had to walk through snow they didn't let any dampness in. I can't wear high heels, and it was nice to find boots like these with low heels. Why only 4 stars? Well, I'm a tough critic, and I could imagine an even cooler design or more comfortable fit, but I'm very happy with them."
237944,0,"This is a great-looking shoe. However, this is no arch support, so it gets uncomfortable. With better support, this could be an outstanding shoe."
99895,1,"I was cautious in &quot;breaking in&quot; this shoe for fear of toe problems from another shoe brand. However, there was no problem with breaking in THIS shoe. Definitely will stick with the Ozweego Classic. Very lightweight, stylish but most of all COMFORTABLE."
306180,0,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
31082,0,"Despite the velcro strap, these are difficult to put on because of the shallow opening at the front of the shoe. Maybe it would fit a very skinny foot."
388591,1,These shoes are comfortable as well as long lasting. They do not make your feet sweat or smell bad like other high top shoes. This shoe never goes op of style
307115,1,I got these shoes a month ago to wear to work since I wanted sandals but the dress code dictates shoes much have a covered toe and heel strap. I don't think I've taken them off since! The only drawback for me is that they aren't really comfy for walking long distances (over a mile.) I started to get blisters. But for every day wear they are fabulous!
286291,0,The boots are great but come with no care instructions at all. The care instructions that come with the care products are also very poor. Hard to understand why such a quality product would not have good care instructions other than the fact the manufacturer would prefer one to ruin the boots so you will buy more !!!!!!!!
122443,1,"These run a bit narrow in the toes but are still comfortable. I'm short, so I like that these are comfortable athletic shoes, but also add 1.5"" in height. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase (and the price) and will be walking my feet off during my trip to London!"
361354,1,"I have another pair of Frye boots and love them. I wear them daily. My wife bought these for me as a gift and, I suspect, to match the pair she has worn for years. She got the size exactly right, but when I tried them on, or rather tried to try them on, they didn't fit at all. I couldn't even get my foot halfway in. It was a real head scratcher. I was about to process a return request when she comes walking out of the bedroom with a pair her stockings, ah, I mean, silk socks, and said try these. I won't share the thoughts occupying my brain at that moment, but I figured what the hey, it's worth a shot. And guess what? The boots slid right on and fit like a glove.Now I'm not going to go out and replace all of my cotton socks with silk stockings, ah, I mean, silk socks, but I have other non-cotton socks that work just as well.The bottom line, these boots, just like my other pair, are amazing, and worth every penny of the price. I just won't mention to anyone that my &#34;manly&#34; dogs are covered with silk stockings, ah, I mean silk socks."
357739,1,"High quality shoe--more than expected. Fit perfectly and very comfortable. Purchased as an Easter shoe, and beautiful! Will wear for a long while."
235414,1,"I love these shoes because the medium runs on the narrow side. They do come in narrow, but not always easy to find in popular size 7. They are classic, tailored, like much of my wardrobe, so I own them in every color and color combination. They also wear well. Excellent quality at a good price. When I'm really lucky, I find them on sale."
323850,1,"I started wearing an orthotic in my shoes several years ago, it has been an endless problem to find shoes especially sandals that can fit an orthotic, this is the only one that has been designed properly. It has a thick innersole that is removable, you can replace it with your orthotic , they also supply another innersole to cover it. Totally comfortable,and rugged enough for light hiking. The orthotic sits down low enough, you do not have the problem of it trying to come out of the back end of the shoe. Great product,thank you Amazon for making it available."
301336,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
174904,1,"I love these sandals. They are incredibly comfortable, and have super arch support. I wear sandals every day,and these hold up very well ( I average one year's wear out of each pair of Rainbows before I have to get a new pair.) Viva la Rainbows -- these are the best."
10930,1,these shoes are so comfortable. the neat thing about these shoes is you can toss them in the washer and they look new again.
292533,1,I have a 3 year old who is hard on shoes. These are good inexpensive boots that last a while . Its definitely worth the money
55594,1,"I previously had the same Keds sneaker. Liked them. Ordered a medium width, not a wide width. Had to return them."
141475,0,"I wish I didnt buy these, if you wear them barefoot they really hurt the soles of your feet. Quite simply the Speedo sandals I bought at Costco a few years ago are FAR more comfortable. If you plan on putting on thick socks whenever you wear these, then they may work better for you."
227518,1,"I love these shoes - they're classic, versatile and comfortable. They wear into the shape of your foot and become like a favorite pair of jeans - worn in all the right places, fitted to your form and reliable. I have two pairs of these and I just bought another pair for my boyfriend (who is now hooked)."
343414,1,The shoes look real good to start with.As for comfort - the only shoes that I counted on till now have been Nike. With all others I use gel soles - but not with Clarks; had ordered another pair (Men's Mercury Oxford) of Clarks; so am certain that I was not just lucky with this pair; they do make good shoes.Looks like my first choice of formal/semi-formal from now on will be Clarks.
26565,0,"The leather on the Student Footlight is pretty stiff and will definitely need some breaking in. I'm hoping that it will soften quickly once it warms up after being worn.My actual shoe size is 9AAA but I frequently wear 8 1/2 N because I can rarely find the 9AAA. In the Jr. Footlight, I wear a 9 1/2 N. When I was trying to decide what size to get in the Student Footlight, I wondered if the fit was similar to the Jr. Footlight and I have to say the Student runs closer to street size. Based on my experience with the Jr. Footlight, I ordered the Student in a 9N and a 9 1/2 N and both were too long. The shoe does seem to run pretty narrow, for those who are wondering. I think the width will be fine once I get the length right.I didn't find a significant difference in the padding/insole of either shoe. High density foam, not much arch support. Not a cushy shoe underneath the foot, but then that may be because it is meant for dance and their assumption is that the wearer would want to be able to ""feel"" the floor through the shoe.As compared to the jr. footlight, the extra 1/2 inch in the heel height of the Student Footlight does make a difference in the leg line and will make the legs look even better on stage or anywhere else."
133888,1,"I was so very glad to find these shoes! I was a bit worried at first-it had been so long since I had a brand new pair of slip on shoes! The reason for that is because Eastlands are so good, I can wear a pair for 10+ years! I have a pair of brown similar ones that I've worn for about that long-maybe longer. But they last forever and are the only brand I will buy. I'm still wearing the brown ones, but wanted a pair of black ones to match my purse and coat for winter. They felt a bit tight at first, but it's been so long since I've had to break in a pair of shoes since Eastlands last so long! Wore them a couple of nights at home, broke in perfectly, now they're my new favorites! I've tried others, but Eastlands are still the best:)"
292270,1,I picked these boots for my husband after reading reviews of all the other work boots out there. I wanted a product made in the US and these are from Wisconsin. He loves these boots and they fit really well. Shipped quickly as well.
126017,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
275257,1,"These boots are the best I've ever owned. So good, that I own two pairs, and bought my dad a pair. And he swears by them too. If you have aching feet, soreness, or a weak ankle, these boots have a therapeutic effect! I am not into medicine or anything but I have to say, these boots are very supportive and make your feet feel strong and no strain on the joints."
141594,1,"This shoe is elegant, it's comfortable, the stacked heel is just right, the height is perfect and over all is a beautiful pair of shoe. I bought both colors that were available.Thank you."
356868,1,"These are cute, they stay tied, and there's just enough slip to use these babies on a dance floor without having to spring for full suede bottoms. They also hold up well when you throw them into a huge dance bag and accidentally crush them in the trunk of your car."
326133,1,"I ordered these for my daughter's birthday and they came in plenty of time and she loves them. Also, they were less expensive than all the other ones that we priced and made very well. It was a great buy!! :)"
91855,1,"THESE ARE GREAT, FOR THE COST VERY HIGH QUALITY BUT ITS WHAT U CAN EXPECT FROM TIMBERLAND,A MUST BUY."
95050,1,"I wear a half-size smaller because these shoes come in wide sizes (i.e they fit)! I'm curious to see how long they will last as they are guaranteed for 1000 miles. Very attractive and comfortable, and reasonably priced. I recommend the quick-adjust velcro for anyone who walks before or after work, or at lunch, or who takes shoes on & off throughout the day."
376242,1,"This is a great shoe, though I find that it runs narrow. I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all. My right foot wentin with some effort. It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in. I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato"
318618,1,Second pair of these shoes for work. They are very comfortable and not too casual. They were delivered on time and the shoes looked great. I am very happy with the service and price!
226314,1,"I've been shopping around for a good pair of Converse for a while, thinking that I could find them for under $20.00 if I looked hard enough. My last pair, which I bought three years ago, was $20, and I thought surely I could find more for less than the $35-45 price tag I was seeing. Stupid inflation.I finally bought these when I realized if I was going to get a new pair, I had to cough up the extra dough. I'm really glad I did. I wore the last pair all the time, and though they're still comfortable and I'm far too attached to them to throw them away, they have holes in the leather and in the sole, and they smell something foul when it rains. I have no doubt that these canvas Converse Chuck's will last just as long and be just as comfortable, and my first few wears makes me confident that I'm right. My last pair was leather, but the same shoe style, so I don't know if the fabric of these will stretch. I do know that the leather ones never did, it only got a little less structured after three years of wear.What I like:1. These are meant to wear as regular sneakers, so while you don't want to go on a run with them, they are just as comfortable if you're going on a long walk. There's no chafing on the heel no matter how far I go, and the support means they're not going to destroy your lower back if you find yourself walking or standing all day.2. For me, at least, they fit true to size. I have wide feet, but the design of the shoe means I can lace them tighter or looser and not worry about them cutting into my circulation or falling off.3. I got the navy blue ones, and the color is exactly what you see in the product picture. It's vibrant, but not bright, and well-dyed and even-toned.As for dislikes, well...there's nothing I dislike about Converse, so you're asking the wrong person if you're looking for complaints. All Converse I've ever owned are comfortable and simple, and I think it's what the brand does best."
335446,1,"Pro: Good design, comfortable.Cons: NoneSummary: I will buy it again."
362284,1,These grasshopper shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The sole of the shoe is cushiony and you almost feel like you are walking on air. I was a bit concerned about the light color (they only had beige available at the time of purchase). There was a little bit of dirt on the shoes and it wiped them off lightly with some warm water. I would definitely recommend these shoes especially for summer and the warmer months.
176939,1,"I love my j renee bev pump shoes. so comfortable, like walking on clouds. Look sooooo good on.The cognac colour goes with everything. Everyone asks me about them. They dress up jeans so well.Heel is not too high and can dress up or go causal with these shoes."
244365,1,These skechers running shoes are probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. They are very light weight compared to my old running shoes and are just a pleasure to wear. You can't beat the price for a quality shoe like this either.
15444,1,"I am very satisfied with the shoes, I have 2 pairs."
43371,1,"Firm support, but soft enough for comfort. Perfect for tennis! And the price is unbeatable! Other online vendors sell the same shoe for twice the amount. Shoes arrived fast!"
379775,0,I purchased these to supplement some others I had my students wearing. I have had to repair the buckles every time hey have been worn.
383892,1,I have worn this model of EAsy Spirit for a long time...Hope they don't discontinue it...Wears well..I have narrow feet so I like the way these fit and are available in AA width...

30622,1,Was very happy with the service and product. The shoes were as described and received as promised.
222276,0,"These shoes are beautiful, but the size 11 I ordered was too small to put on."
261716,1,I love my new shoes! They fit great and I got them in no time. Thanks. * * * *
141901,0,"This has been a decent winter running shoe with plenty of stability, fair amount of cushion, and decent traction. My primary gripe has been the insert not staying in place and riding back in the shoe."
158703,0,"I bought the shoes for my husband. He says, ""The shoes are not comfortable. I like the colors and they look good but they are not comfortable at all. I will probably never buy this type again."""
3402,1,"was given a pair of these shoes used,worked in them in my shop welding/ machining/auto & truck repair for about 6 years. very comfortable & rugged. this is why i went online @ located another pair through amazon. so far this pair is exceeding my expectations. my thanks to AMAZON & HI-TEC: heavyhaull"
336667,0,I like these shoes but will not buy this kind again. They are comfortable for a little while but not for the long hall. Once they are broken in they still make my feet hurt after 3 hours
344924,1,THANKS FOR GETTING 2 ME SO FAST......HE LOVES IT....THANKS AGAIN HAVE A GOOD NEW YEAR FOR ALL U DID FOR ME....
192608,1,"Love the style of this sandal. Not my first pair. Very comfortable, good fit in the size I need. The only problem I had was that the color was not what I thought I was ordering, but would like to have more colors in the same style."
377744,1,"My father is the most difficult person to please. He absolutely hates to try new things, regardless of quality. I chose to buy this slipper for him as a Christmas gift, knowing that his old pair was worn. I also knew that he has worn the same style of slipper for the last thirty years. But I am familiar with the quality of Hush Puppies, and since they were quite similar to the old style my father wears, I decided to try them. He loves them, style, color, sole and everything. He says they are incredibly comfortable. So I give this product 5 stars because my father actually liked it, which is, in itself, a feat of inestimable value, let alone star ranking."
249100,1,"I am an avid collector of Kenneth Cole footwear, apparel, and accessories. The Coast On By Sandal in tan color is a sight to behold and the craftmanship is second to none. The tan color of the leather is an eye catcher and I have received numorous compliments for the selection. The design is sleek and a great addition to my sandal collection to wear with jeans and chinos. A great buy!!!"
21828,1,Nicely made and soft leather shoe. Very comfortable and smart looking. Would recommend to all. A good price compared to the department stores.
168959,1,"These socks are for shoe size 12.5-5. My son is a size 5. I bought these for him for soccer. I think they will fit for another year, even if his foot grows. Currently, they fit over his shin guards and fold over below the knee about 2.5"". If he grows, the fold will be smaller, but that's OK. I love how these came in a huge variety of colors, so I could get the color that matches the league jerseys. My son said, ""They're fuzzy. I like that,"" when he put them on for the first time. I don't think they're fuzzier than other athletic socks, so I'm not sure what he meant. But, he's happy, so I'm happy. These are a great price for 3 pairs!"
265343,1,"I'm really, really happy with these boots. An awesome price for a super-sturdy piece of footwear that seems like it's going to last a really long time. I needed footwear that would support my ankles, for both every day walking and hitting the hills with my dogs. These fit the bill.Why buy a second pair?Two reasons:1) I'm paranoid the price will go up.2) These are nice enough to wear out into the real world, and I didn't want to have to worry about keeping my daily pair ""nice"".The biggest problem for me? They do require some breaking in and for me, it was kind of a painful process. They are rigid, strong boots, and they do give way eventually. Already, after only a few months, my first pair are taking on that nice patina that well-worn leather boots get.It makes me said that I'll have to go through that process again with my second pair, which will take longer because they will be worn less frequently."
242086,1,"I gave this snikers to my 15 year-old son and he loved. It has a juvenile color and it can use it daily, are confortables, the color is durable. Their friends have liked it. I recommend it"
226969,1,"Been wearing converse for years; great shoes, came just as promised in the picture and description. Cheaper, even with the shipping expenses, then in the stores where you can find all black chucks. Shoes packaged very well; shipping was ridiculously fast, had it in two days; great amazon experience!"
359280,1,"Crocs are soooo comfortable. With foot problems, they're the only shoes I can wear throughout the day. Love them!"
117709,0,"The ballet shoes are very nice, but not true to size. My granddaughter (age 4) wears a size 7, I ordered a 7.5 to give her room to grow, and they were too small! Some advice about the sizing would have been helpful. Now we have to send them back."
100768,0,"I had read the reviews to order bigger, because they run small, so I did. I ordered a full size larger, and they were still too small. I also ordered narrow, and they weren't very narrow. I had to send them back, and did not order a different size, because I didn't get the full refund. Very cute, but not worth it."
298705,1,Bought these for my 5 year old. He's on his 3rd pair. Love Crocs. Bought ND to support my husband. But they are navy blue and go with everything.
191932,1,I am satisfied with what i got! I love it so much.thinking of buying again with different colors.good job guys.
273452,1,"I've had two pairs of these shoes and they are by far my favorites. I didn't realize when I bought the first pair that they are actually ""lightweight"" trainers, which means you're not really supposed to use them for long runs and high mileage. I have trained for and completed two marathons and two 10-mile road races in them and never had a problem, plenty of cushioning, extremely comfortable. I don't like a lot of arch support because it hurts my feet, and this shoe has just enough support. Also, this shoe has plenty of room in the toe box--many others cramp my feet in the front. Highly recommended."
172045,1,Natualizer is known for it's comfort. I wear a 10W and these shoes are very comfortable as well as stylish which is hard to find in my size. I really love them and wish they came in more colors.
215937,1,"I have these in the Leopard, and they are so cute with jeans and really comfy shoes. Mine are true to size."
118445,1,"These sandals are great. The heel is not too high, true to size and very comfortable. Can be dressy or casual."
141803,0,"This has been a decent winter running shoe with plenty of stability, fair amount of cushion, and decent traction. My primary gripe has been the insert not staying in place and riding back in the shoe."
181191,1,This was eactly what I was looking for. Perfect fit. Prompt Delivery.
167242,1,"Super comfortable, easy to walk. My mom wears it around the house like slippers and she loves it. I'm glad I got it for her, it's very important that her shoes are comfortable."
275269,0,I have had several pairs of these boots over the years and liked them. The most recent pair had a manufacturing defect that was biting thre inside of my left ankle. I had to lace them so loose that the support was inadequate. I guess with Chinese children making boots you can't expect perfection.
166263,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
283787,1,I wasnt really sure if I liked this shoe at first but after trying it on i realised just how comfortable and stylish this shoe is. This shoe is awesome for basketball and just walking around
342698,1,"VERY fast shipping. I bought shoes as a gift and was sure that they wouldn't be delivered in time, but they made with days to spare! And the shoes looked lovely. Thanks so much! :)"
172740,2,"Even if you've worn these since the 60s, 70s, or 80s (as I have), do yourself a favor and DON'T order these online. They're smaller than they used to be and after wearing them for decades they no longer fit (too narrow especially). Not only are they hard to find in stores now, but now that most people will be ordering them online they changed the sizing. Worse, if you order direct from K-Swiss they will take a return but will deduct $5.00 unless you do an exchange. I'd exchange for a 12 wide but they don't have one listed on their site for this shoe, nor on this page as of this writing. Too bad, because I really liked them for 30 years."
367974,1,"I had another pair of this exact shoe and wore them out from wearing them so much. I couldn't find them anywhere locally, so I was so glad to find them here. They are great shoes."
303409,1,"I bought these when we were living in Belgium and owned two cars with manual transmissions so I needed some sandals that I could safely work the clutch pedal with. These were just fine. I still love my old Birkies more than these but these are well made, reasonably priced, and great for working a clutch if you own a car with a manual transmission."
156229,0,"The ballet shoes are very nice, but not true to size. My granddaughter (age 4) wears a size 7, I ordered a 7.5 to give her room to grow, and they were too small! Some advice about the sizing would have been helpful. Now we have to send them back."
155481,1,"LAST CHRISTMAS I ORDERED THIS BOOT AND NOW THIS YEAR THE PRICE HAS DOUBLED. I AM WISHING THAT I HAD ORDERED MORE THAN ONE PAIR. I WILL ORDER ANOTHER PAIR THIS YEAR. I LIKE THE SOLES AND HEELS ON THIS BOOT BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER THAN MOST AND THIS IS THE FINEST LOOKING DRESS BOOT MADE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. IT IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE BOOT THAT I HAVE FOUND. YOU WILL GET SOME RESPECT WHEN YOU ARE SEEN IN THESE BOOTS. THESE BOOTS ARE ""BOSS"" TO SAY THE LEAST."
313802,1,One of the best items I have ever bought; she loved them. I will purchase again a different pair of shoes at a later date.
132642,1,"These shoes just arrived. I ordered an 8 after looking at dancedepot.com, which said this style runs true to size, and measuring my daughter's feet with a tape measure, against their measurement chart. The 8 JUST fits her. I know toddler shoe sizes run all over the place, but my daughter wears a 7 or 7.5 in street shoes with room to wiggle her toes, so I would say that these run a tad small. Luckily I have a younger daughter who will inherit these lovely shoes when her older sister outgrows them (which I am guessing will be in the next few months). I will order a larger size for my older girl, as I'm very happy with the quality of the shoe overall."
276843,0,"I hike several days a week all year in rough mountain terrain, much of it off-trail and over rocks. I've gone through several pairs of these Hi-Tec Altitude boots over the years. The factory supplied insoles are comfortable initially, but are made of a compressible closed cell foam that eventually does not rebound from compression well after some months of use. When the foam becomes compressed, the padded effect is lost and my feet begin to hurt. This can be solved by purchasing and installing an aftermarket pair of insoles such as the Sole Softec Ultra foodbeds, or another quality insole.This problem is not exclusive to Hi-Tec, as I've seen it with other boots and running shoes also. Some aftermarket insoles/footbeds are made of resilient material that does not tend to stay compressed with heavy use. I am not sure why the manufacturers of boots and shoes don't just use suitable footbeds in the first place, but I assume that they save a little money by doing what they do.Aside from the poor insoles, the boots themselves are comfortable, keep my feet warm in fairly cold weather even though they are not insulated, and the soles provide good traction."
321061,1,"These are good dance shoes and hold up well! However, I have a foot that is somewhat narrower than normal, and these slippers are extremely wide. I had to pull the strings for a while until I got the proper fit. But then the material from the slippers started to rub at my heel bones from the tightness. It was a little painful so I readjusted the strings to loosen them in the heel area and now the slippers fit comfortably. I did notice, however, that after using them for just one dance class, the sole started to darken significantly. It's not a big deal to me, but others might be bothered by it."
357903,1,"I ordered these shoes for a high school student to wear during a production. After reading the reviews, we decided to order them one full size larger that the normal shoe size. This was definitely the way to go. After hours of use there were no blisters or pain. I recommend going the full size larger."
64151,0,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not &#34;tall&#34; enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
326547,1,"Flip-flop looks great, feels comfy (just tried on, haven't wore for any length of time), but the color description on the pair I purchased was brown(sole)/white(straps)...the straps are actually an off-white, not white...not what I was expecting."
151766,0,"I feel like I wasted my money with these shoes. They were expensive and were not as supportive as I wanted. They're okay for walking around shopping or something but not for working around the ranch, which is what I wanted. Nice fit and comfortable, though."
270932,1,"A very elegant pair of shoes at a reasonable price. What really amazed me was the intact condition upon receipt. I must say that this is the first time I buy shoes online. No minor scars or damage...better than buying at the shoe store! The shoes come wrapped in protective material inside a very nice box, conserving the fresh leather smell and shine."
84857,1,"Great sandal. I got to replace some aqua socks I've had for years that fell apart while at a water park. These are super comfortable and can easily be work with the heel strap on or off. Look kinda clunky, but that's the idea. Love the toe protection, which has saved me many times. I would definitely get again."
280825,1,I love these shoes and color as well. Look great with khakis and jeans and the seam in the middles is really cool. The laces were not very strong but i bought replacements for a dollar; no problem.
257303,1,"These shoes are inexpensive, light weight, and very comfortable.They were hard to get on at first. There is a loop on the tongue that holds the laces... I relaced the shoes without using the loop and they went on much easier.I'm happy with them."
374463,1,"This shoe is one of the most comfortable I've ever owned. Great for hiking, walking, or just regular weekend wear."
140433,1,"I love this shoe! I am SO glad that I gave them a second shot - I had heard so many good things about this sandal that when they first came in the mail, I didn't waste any time ripping open the box and putting them on... and I was really dissapointed. Right out of the box, I did not find them comfortable at all. The arch was a bit uncomfortable (a little too high) and the fabric was kind of stiff... I didn't think I'd ever enjoy these sandals. However, I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning them, so I decided I'd give them a little chance and wore them around my kitchen while I made supper. They were getting MUCH better. Within 3 minutes I was thinking ""hmm... I could actually wear these."" Now they are my absolute favorite pair of sandals. They are so comfortable, and my feet feel just great in them. I am SO SO glad that I gave them a second chance!"
134740,1,""" Santa"" brought these for my son and he hasn't taken them off since! I was worried about how they would fit since he didn't try them on first and he has a narrow foot, but no complaints from him!"
219905,1,"awesome shoes. what can i say. look great with pants, jeans, khakis. whatever. versatile, durable, sylish. you won't regret this purchase. maybe run a half size bigger than my size. but it's iffy."
298902,2,They're not very confortable. Not a lot of support for even walking one hour straight in. Probably wouldnt order them again. Wasn't impress with their shipping practice either.
32249,1,I have very flat feet and no arch in my feet (shoe store lady told me she never seen such flat feet in her entire life) She recommended the Gel Kayno Shoes and they have been really Great! So good in Fact that I decided to only wear Gel Kayno shoes...My first pair cost me $139.00 and a year and some months later I decided I like them so much that I brought the exact same pair for $79.00. (i wear these shoes with arch support insules from finish line and really i have not found a better more comfortable shoe)
365401,1,"What else can I say? Converse's Chuck Taylor High-Tops have been tried and true for decades. They are comfortable, fun and in my case, red. I am 51 years young and I receive more compliments on these shoes than any other item of apparel that I own. Love them."
129982,1,I've been wearing this exact Executive Imperial Wingtip shoe for more than twenty years. They are extremely durable and still take a great shine for the entire life of the shoe. They break in quickly and run true to size.
171892,1,"My daughter is a size 12, and these fit perfectly - they were not too tight and she loves wearing them in dance class. My friend bought her daughter a pair of jazz shoes at Payless for the same price ($26), and her daughter was complaining that they were too tight - those shoes were also a size 12. I highly recommend these.Gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the seller doesn't provide amazon prime shipping option."
121037,1,Shoes arrived witin the stated delivery time. The colour was as shown. Very good shoe and I would recomend it. Looks quite nice under pants as well as skirts.
250435,1,"These sandals are great for a busy summer. We've purchased them every year since my son was 16 months old. They are easy for kids to put on, non-slip, and dry quickly after getting wet."
48307,0,sizes seems off.. I asked for M60 & the flip flop said M50 but it was still little bit lose... the quality is much better... & soft...
341023,1,entrega al d&iacute;a mercanc&iacute;a en buen estado responsables los productos que uno compra son los que env&iacute;an tal cual como se hace el pedido
103998,1,These shoes are wonderful. The comfort of a sneaker that you can where to work with no one the wiser. I highly recommend these to any woman who wants comfort at work and away.
210108,1,ilove dis items so i want to order for it pls help me
306630,1,"These boots are awesome. Very comfortable, stylish and wipe with a damp cloth to look new again. I love them!"
50454,1,Looked all over and could not find these anywhere including the Vans outlet here locally. Arrived on time and fit great.Love my Vans!!!
345803,1,"I felt that my karma would be bad if I didn't take a moment to describe my experience in dealing with GrandSlamNY. I purchased a pair of Converse All Star's for my girlfriend for Christmas. I got the size she asked for (even took into account the additional information supplied on the site about how the size of this particular shoe runs about a size big. When they arrived they were too big! I THEN checked the return policy and saw that the period had expired (I partied hard during the holidays and the shoes were returned close to 4 weeks after purchase. I sent an email to the owner of the store and he told me to send them back for exchange. I did so and received the new pair 4 days after mailing the incorrect pair back to him. I will do business with them again because, on top of everything, for the size I needed, GrandSlam had the lowest price. Good lookin, David."
63085,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
245000,1,These are great for my 13month old who is walking. Barefoot is easiest but when we go out these are the next best thing. The best part about the penny loafer is that they go with anything- dress outfits or comfy clothes.
318929,1,Hush Puppies Mall Walkers are an excellent product. Fit well. Good support. True to size. Highly recommend them for casual wear.Hush Puppies Men's Mall Walker Oxford
167968,1,"Shoes were received in original packaging, band new! My son is going to love them, they are just what he wanted & I got what I expected. Thanks..."
43380,1,"Great price and quick delivery. I have worn Wilson Pro Staff tennis shoes for 20 or more years, so you know I like them. You play in them the first time, and they feel broke-in immediately. I play two to three times a week and the soles don't wear out on the heels and edges for well over 6 months. Others may pay more than twice as much for theirs shoes, but not me as long as these classics are available."
311376,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
328321,1,My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them. He says they are comfortable and also look good. I would recommend them to anyone.
76347,1,"I sing/dance in several amateur theater productions a year. After going through several pairs of lower quality character shoes in the last few years, I decided to spend the money and buy Capezios. Once I began rehearsing in them, I was immediately glad I spent the money. They're worth it!The leather is stiff enough to support but still flexible enough to conform to my foot, & the strap is securely attached and doesn't fray at the end. The elastic attaching the buckle is well attached to the shoe, not something that will soon fray and break. Nothing inside the shoe or on the uppers has an edge to rub on the foot, so they've been comfortable from the first wearing.I would suggest buying a 1/2 size larger than your street shoe size. I don't normally wear a wide shoe, but the fit is perfect, so unless you normally wear a narrow shoe, I'd order the wide. I've also found they give me a more adult look than the mary jane-style character shoes. I went from 1 1/2"" to 2"" heels with no problem. The only problem I had is that the sole was a bit too smooth, even after a few wearings, and I had to scuff them quite a bit to keep from slipping & falling!"
226800,1,"With Christmas looming, I ordered these blue Converse Lo Tops. They arrived immediately! Crisp, new and perfect fit for my daughter.The extra pair of navy shoelaces arrived two weeks later, separately. No problem, we all had a good laugh over the arrival of onepair of shoelaces, amidst all the flurry of Christmas packages. Thank you!"
129908,0,The shoes fit well but the sole is thin making it hard to walk over stones or climbing up onto shore. I purchased them to protect my feet while tubing down a river. They would be better used on a beach or boating.
40264,1,This is a really great sandal. I have bought them in the past and have found them to be very comfortable. Not like regular flip flops. The narrow strap makes them very fashionable along with the many colors they come in. After wearing them for awhile they seem to mold to your foot shape. What I like most about them is they have a built in arch which is great for people like me who have a low arch or are flatfooted. Also the price at Amazon.com is a great buy compared to what I have payed for them in the past at other places.
128700,1,This is more a review about the easy return than the product itself. I own many pairs of these in different colors. You can't find them at the store any more so I ordered here. One shoe came with glue lumps under the sole that wouldn't even out. The other shoe was fine. Amazon refunded the money and I didn't have to pay return shipping.
40195,1,These shoes are really cushy for flip flops and very comfortable. They stay put on my feet even when I'm running and they are so darn cute.
150391,2,"Ordered a size 8N in blue, received a 9N in black. What more can I say?The seller has no quality control."
231697,1,"I first found these shoes at Shoe Carnival last year and had been looking for a second pair ever since. They are so comfy- and this coming from a woman who can't stand flip flops with that thing between your toes! If you cook or stand a lot at home, BUY THESE SHOES. There's something about the foam that keeps my feet from hurting, especially after cooking or doing laundry for an hour or more. I bought a black pair for inside and a brown one for outside. As for my old black ones? I wear them outside now. They've never slipped off- even when running for the bus! Get the 2 pack. I'm a witness..."
72253,1,Good value for the money. The soles provide more support than I anticipated. The only drawback is that they are definitely not as stylish as I had hoped.
106235,0,"I had been looking for an SAS outlet online without success, and found these shoes which looked VERY similar, but cost about $40 less. I decided to try a pair and they are pretty comfortable but much tighter than the SAS shoes. I use a 9W in SAS and ordered a 9 C/D in the Softspot version, although the box they came in was labeled as the same size as 9W, the same size as the SAS. The Softspot shoe is smaller and tighter than the SAS, so next time I will order a wider or bigger size."
241006,1,These boots are the most comfortable boots I've had. This is my second pair. In my years in the military I've had custom made boots which don't even compare to the comfort of these. The only bad thing is that they are a bit bulky and not the lightest out there. Overall they are a great everyday boot.
189898,0,"Bought these for a white school uniform shoe. It is narrow at the ball of the foot, completely straight where your foot would be widest. Might want to consider a wide width or one size larger, even if you don't normally need wide. Seems to hold up well to wear. Leather in good condition."
40711,1,"I have been in pair after pair of the black Reef Ginger flip flops for well over a decade now. When I first saw their skinny, comfy little strap and the cushiony, arch-supported footbed with durable rubber bottoms I was in love. I even love the little rubber Reef logo tag along the strap. They make me feel like a cool surfer chick even though I've never seen a surfboard in person. I live in the South and I pretty much wear mine from late spring through summer and into fall when I start feeling self-conscious beginning of October and have to switch over to proper shoes. I can get by with one pair every couple years, but they really start to look rough around the middle of that second summer. They casual up a flowy maxi dress and go perfectly with jean shorts or cropped jeans...and pretty much anything else.These seem to have been slightly altered from the models I've had in the past. Little difference in the fabric strap pattern and the pattern on the bottom rubber piece. No biggie.They come in whole sizes only. I'm almost always a 7.5 in shoes so I wear the seven and they fit to my foot great. My mom is an 8.5 and wears the size 8 Reefs and they look great. I don't think your heel or toes will fall off if you get the half size down. But I guess that is personal preference if you like to go up and get a roomier pair, say if maybe you have really long toes or wide feet. When I first slip a new pair on the straps are a little snug but they stretch to fit perfectly after one wearing.Just about as lady-like as a pair of flip flops can get."
310950,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
80441,1,My daughter loves converse so the fact that it fit her witout us having to return or try on in the store was a plus - it arrived on time
370986,1,These are all black Chucks! You get what you would normally expect from Chucks. What else can you say? Love em
57703,1,"I wear Ked sneakers always and I was over joyed to find this show at such a low price. It is just as expected, great quality and reliable shoe!"
250967,2,"When I had decided to purchase this particular style, I clicked on the ""Sizing info"" link next to the size choice box. I very carefully followed the directions there, then used the measurements I made to reference against the sizing chart. From there, and partly against my own better judgement, I made my size choice thinking that I shouldn't have to guess at the right size, this precisely laid-out process should yield the correct size choice.Well, I should have just guessed, because what I got were shoes that were about right for my neighbor's 2 year old instead of my 10 year old.On the plus side they weren't expensive enough to make it worth the effort and cost to return them. So I gave them to my neighbor.And luckily I was able to find something in a brick-and-mortar store that worked for the costume I was putting together for my son.Maybe I'm just an idiot and followed the directions wrong, but I won't be buying shoes from Amazon again anytime soon. Maybe pictures with the different size shoes in the same frame as a clearly labeled ruler would be more useful than a giant table full of numbers that repeat themselves at arcane intervals and are best understood by shoe-industry professionals."
250376,1,"HELP!, I need somebody, HELP! Not just anybody....and soforth. I cant buy these shoes ANYWHERE!!! Ive searched all over and they either dont have them in my size or I just cant buy them. this site wont let me buy them cuz it isnt listened as a product i can buy... i have no idea why. If any1 has any information on where i can get my hands on these shoes please email me at: stevemosca@hotmail.com"
324098,2,"I do believe that this product is a type of Birkenstock, or maybe they have a license to sell as a Birkenstock, but they are not the Original Birkenstock as they claim to be.I did not appreciate the service I received from Midwest Sports. Choosing the size by the sizing chart and comparing it to my shoe size, I thought I chose the correct size; but it was not, it was a size larger. So I had to exchange them. Not only did I have to pay for the postage to return the item, I was also charged to have the correct size mailed back to me. In my past experiences, the dealer has always been the one to pay for the postage.Will I purchase from Midwest Sports again? No."
252118,1,"Had to return them due to not fitting which is no falt of the boot. They were perfect, just not perfect for my feet. :("
325300,1,I love to go out and dress up with these shoes on! They are pretty comfortable and fun!
305215,1,"Love these shoes...I bought the pewter color which goes well with silver/platinum. (Just not as super-shiny as the silver version of these shoes looked online.) Did put an insole in as they have no support or cushioning whatsoever. With this inexpensive insole - the shoes are perfect. Nice crossover of the metallic and ballet flat trend, but timeless looking. They go with everything!"
348576,1,"i was worried about the way the sandals look in the picture since they round up, but ddint effect walking or anything. very comfortable my boyfriend says. he likes them a lot!"
3644,1,"I like the no scuff leather. The boots broke in hard , but all the good boots I have had broke in hard. I have a pair of Hi- Tec boots like this pair I have had for years and if this pair holds up as good I will be a Hi-Tec wearer for life!"
114404,1,"My youngest daughter who has a wide foot needed these for her ballet class. They are always reliable and fit as they should. Also as a Prime member, they qualified for FREE two day shipping. If your little one is starting out in dance or is a pro, these are the best shoes. Oh yeah, the price is also very economical."
323921,1,These wooden shoe trees are a great bargain for the price. I purchased 3 on my last order and plan on purchasing the exact same shoe trees to fill all my shoes.
84410,1,I really am completely satisfied with the product and with the attention given by you really that I have recommended my friends and well I hope to buy something and receive the same attention
207063,0,"Firstly, I will list what makes this shoe great! I have had shoes before like this that were called ""leather"" yet the fabric torn within the first use. However, this is made from fine, real leather material I found to be very durable and of a high quality. The footbeds are some of the best I have ever used, and the bottom soles seem to be very stred resistant, unlike many dress shoes. I did find these shoes a little hot without super thin socks. Fit wise, there are some negatives. *I had to get this in a 4E, two widths normal than usual, which I usually never need to do. So be careful when chosing your width* Also the lining of the shoes is a little snug, maybe I am being picky, but that was just a little uncomfortable. The look is as simple as can be, so it will go with everything! As long as you are size cautious, you'll end up with a quality shoe."
366050,0,i think that this sneaker was a bit tight but otherwise a good buy. waiting to procure a similar item.
70215,1,"For quick moving feet and an improved jump shot pick up the dunk-feast a3 adidas b-bal shoe, you will not find a better fit. Great support for lower ankles and arches. Over all great shoe"
117897,0,This is not an all terrain shoe and should be used only for manicured grass and soft tracks.... but for those surfaces it is an excellent shoe
317488,1,"Bought these in 2 colors, the violet and red. I am purchasing the rest of the colors. My advice to you is ... if they have your size, get them before they are gone!These are the most comfortable shoes I've purchased in a very long time. So much so that I have actually worn them as slippers in the house.The Francesca Flat is very well constructed and an extremely flexible sole only adds to my satisfaction. The colors are deep and rich. One reviewer indicated that the red was more of a burgandy, but that is not really accurate. It is a dark red, but not candy apple red. It is certainly not burgandy. The violet is simply gorgeous.This shoe will dress up or down. I've worn them with everything from black for early cocktails to jeans and a silk blouse for something more casual. Very versatile addition to any shoe wardrobe, and a solid 5 star rating."
219477,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
212385,1,"I love these shoes! I have bought several pairs in different colors. They are as comfortable as atheltic shoes but much more stylish. But beware--they run small! I normally wear a size 6.5, but I have to order a size 7 with these."
158475,1,I bought these for the sole purpose of weightlifting. Excellent ankle support and flat bottoms without much heel make these an ideal shoe in the gym. These shoes provide very firm footing and i would highly recommend them to bodybuilders on a budget.
321579,1,i like these shoes to wear around the house instead of house slippers.they are comfortable.have them in all colors.i realy like them.
344576,1,"This is a nice Justin Roper boot. The boot does not come with a liner, so you need to put one in. Actually this is a nice option so you can decide if you want to put in a thicker one."
254619,1,"These boots are exactly the same as the pairs I owned 30 years ago, they don't last that long I was elated to find them again at such a reasonable cost."
271192,1,Just what you would expect from Steve Madden. Fits true to size. Best of the gladiators!
326469,1,These are some of my most comfortable and dependable flip flops I've ever owned. I had my first pair for eight years until darling puppy decided to chew them into peices. I was so elated to discover that they're still available and I ordered a replacement pair. Super comfortable that gets better with time - great arch support.
169579,1,"I fell in love with Puma Gvvs the moment I saw them at the mall. Already owning two pairs of Puma Gvs (with shoelaces instead of velcro), I couldn't wait to get my hands on a pair of gvvs. They are ridiculously cute; however, I have no idea why Puma only manufactures them as men's shoes. I could never see a guy wearing these shoes.Anyway, I bought a pair from the puma website. I am typically a size 6 in women's, but got a 5.5 in men's which is a 7 in women's (because they were all out of smaller sizes). I was very happy with the way they look, except that they were too big for me. After a while though, the bottom of the shoes started yellowing. Of my two pairs of puma gvs, one yellowed and one has stayed white. I don't know why puma makes shoes whose soles turn yellow! It's gross and I hate it! So I would recommend purchasing these shoes in person. Feel the sole; I've found that the pairs that stay white are more plasticy and slightly glossyish. Besides turning yellow, they are great shoes!"
103879,1,"Who notices a man's shoe?Well, oddly enough people have had nice compliments. They are comfy and easy to slip on if you need to jump out a window at a moment's notice. The tread on them is interesting. I can't say what long time wearing will do to it but it borders on wearing rubber cleats without scuffing the floor.I say buy them ... but then what would make me special for wearing them if you have the same pair?"
362434,1,Very comfortable and true to size. Love the red or black shoestring options. In my opinion you can't go wrong with Saucony.
361306,1,"These are the best flip-flops I've ever worn! Not only do they have great arch support, but there was no break-in period (no blisters!). Comfortable from day one. I'm hooked. I want a pair in each color!"
28977,0,"These shoes were a lot dressier than I thought they were, I wanted them for everyday shoes to wear with dressier jeans and slacks. These shoes are very shiny almost like tuxedo shoes but they look really nice and the price can't be beat."
277330,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
383615,0,"I though this was a comfortable shoe that's why I bought it but it really stiff in the arches that every time I go walking in it my feet hurt but maybe i just have weak arches it's kind of lose in the heels but maybe i bought it too wide, hopefully it gets comfortable after a while."
60890,1,"This is my third pair. The first finally wore out after 5 years of use in the yard and all around durring the winter and my second is reserved for just hiking, (they took me over the Indian Himilayas very nicely, thank you.)Light weight, inexpensive, and a good fit. I can recomend them. Oh Yea they truly are water proof till about 5 years old."
115828,1,I had a pair of boots that I worked in for two years. These boots were just like them. I like them very much.
209172,1,Product arrived faster than I expected and it was exactly what I expected it to be but it was too small for my son. So I returned it.
181406,1,These shoes have been the traditional Xmas gift to my sail boating son-in-law for 20+ years. He will not wear any other boat shoe. The 9 wide is a perfect fit. Most other brands do not come in wide.
351911,1,I purchased these shoes for my husband for PT because I have Asics and I love them. My husband says that he really likes them. Comfortable shoes!
299057,1,"I bought these becasue I like very flat and simple shoes. Some reviews say these run big, but I ordered my usual size 13 and they fit great."
62898,0,"I have always loved Keds sneakers, however, 2 weeks after purchasing these shoes, the bottoms came loose and I had to throw them away."
89712,1,"I run somewhere between 30-50 miles a week and am a mild pronator. I'm on my second pair of the GTS 7's in about 6 months and I rotate between these and the similarly designed shoe from Mizuno (Wave Inspire 3) and Adidas (Supernova). Personally speaking, I find the Adrenaline are a pretty decent compromise between these shoes. They feel comfortable, pretty responsive, and generally wear very well once broken in. I feel faster in my Mizuno's, though (I don't think I've ever raced in the Brooks), and there is a definite break in period for me where one of my pinky toes can get badly blistered if I run exclusively in the Brooks. Once they're broken in, though, this isn't a problem, and if I rotate shoes, it also isn't a problem so I really don't fault anything in the design of the Adrenalines.With a couple changes these could probably be my favorite shoes and a shoe I would race in, but as is, they're about tied with the Mizuno's as my favorite running shoe."
297826,1,"These are a great pair of shoes--stylish, comfortable (for the most part) and very well made. They are exactly what you would expect from a Clarks shoe. The fit is true to size, good amount of cushioning in the sole, heel is just right. My only complaint--and a minor one at that--is that there is some breaking in required, the top portion of the shoe tends to rub the top of your foot. But this is minor and can be solved by wearing the shoes with socks around the house for a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend these shoes."
355781,1,These shoes are great for the price. I agree with other reviewers who say the shoes run small. I ordered size 7 for a size 6 foot and they fit well.
199210,1,"I took a chance and ordered these online ahead of a three-and-a-half week trip to Italy. These shoes MADE that trip a joy. They are exceedingly comfortable: the velcro straps allow precise adjustment, the padding removes all chance of blisters. But, even more than that, they provide support for balance and stability. Besides walking in city centers with cobblestones and uneven pavements, i wore them when we hiked in natural areas as well. They were brilliant! They also make a reasonable transition to city life. I got the black leather ones, which looked fine in restaurants and at conferences. They were worth every penny!"
156230,1,"We love the color, very comfortable, my niece just love them. These are high quality product let me tell you :) Order came as I expected, we are so happy with Capezio products :) and amazon has better prices than at the stores, I compared the prices :)"
358273,1,It works like a charm. My husband cannot bend very well due to his age and this helps him put on his shoes every time.
49247,1,"Man... i wore these as a kid and some of the older dudes at work thought it would be fun to purchase them to wear on casual fridays. I bought the leather ones and can't get over how comfortable they are. Darn if I don't get complimented on them, too. PF Flyers make you ""run faster and jump higher""!"
150046,0,"These sandals do what I wanted -- keep water off my feet at the pool and provide a quick slip on/off at my other exercise classes. But I was surprised how goofy these looked on me in person! First, several reviewers recommended sizing up, but I would disagree. I usually wear a 9.5 or 10, so I got a 10, and these extend over an inch behind my heels. The band over the foot is excessively tall, making it pretty loose to walk in. If you tighten the velcro, the top part of the band then sticks straight out to the side, which just looks silly. Finally, I'm not sure if it's just the too-large size, but the sandals look much bulkier on me than they do in the picture. They are fairly heavy and thick in both the sole and the band. I'm very lazy about returning purchases so I kept these -- but I'd recommend skipping them and looking elsewhere."
320270,0,"I wanted a pair of trendy cute slip-ons. However, when I received them, they weren't nearly as cute as the pictures make them out to be. They have a really bulbous round toe, my boyfriend (lovingly) called them ""clown shoes"" the first time he saw me wear them!I got these in the black and red floral print and the red looks understated in the pics but is actually fire engine red in real life. Sadly, I don't wear these to work like I wanted to but they are fine for running to the mail box or the grocery store.As far as quality of the shoe, it's a nice shoe. Well made, pretty comfy, no complaints about that. Just wish it were cuter and not clowny."
287193,1,"I have been wearing the Rockport ProWalkers for many years. I wear them at work and wear out a pair every 9-12 months. They ""ugly out"" before they actually wear out. I have always had black and I polish them once a month or so. They are the only shoe that lasts through a Disney World vacation. I am not limping at the end of the day. When they are 4 to 6 months old I usually place a foam pad into them to renew the soft feeling."
259829,2,"was gonna mark this one star...the size was miss-leading, and too large for my daughter to wear. She really, really wanted these, was soooo excited when she opened them. One full size, or more, too large, maybe men's vs. women's? Miss-marked? Now what? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem. But...the quality was very nice, shipped well, all that. SO, two stars."
76201,1,I received a tottaly different pair of boots !!Instead of leather I received suede and the model was not the same ...I hate returns so I am glad I like the boots...
126613,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
106540,1,"i got these cleats for $50 at amazon. they are the best cleats i have ever bought. I am not sure they are worth $150 which is what they are asking for them right now but if you will use them every day, they are worth it. i kick somewhat better in them and they clean very easily. this is a big deal for me because i travel a lot and my team's home field is constantly muddy. the interchangeable parts of the shoe seem cool but i don't actually change parts of it depending in where i am playing. it takes a little while to actually do it."
226600,1,Good ppl had a problem with my tracking number so i emailed them and with great responce my questions were answered..
56402,1,"I have been wearing KEDs for over 50 years, love them. They were exactly what I odered, no problems"
92171,2,"Nice looking shoes, but the ones I received are way too small. They say size 7.5N, but definitely are not. I will have to return them."
273042,1,I bought the shoes for my father who just turned 49 and he rocks them from day one hard body!
384333,0,"These shoes are great if not for getting the wrong size, as I now find out. I ordered a half size bigger than what I normally wear, so when these arrived yesterday, I tried them on. I ordered Size 7.5 M (US) which is what I order for CLARKS, and these shoes fit are smaller. Other than the fit, I really like the look of the shoes as well as the quality of the leather used to make it, so I do hope I can exchange the ones I received for a size that fits better. If these fit, I am sure I would be quite happy with them. Just be aware that the size as posted can either run a half size larger or smaller. Mine was the latter.I will change or put up another review for this once this is resolved."
354197,1,"They're very well-made. They don't have much arch support, so I did have to add inserts. Otherwise, I'm really glad to have purchased these."
261404,1,"These are great shoes, very comfortable! The shipping was on time, and I am overall very pleased with them."
61381,1,"These boots are quite the surprise! At first I thought ""another tennis shoe boot"" . Not so! I started to wear them to get a feel and they were pretty good out of the box. After a long committed hike of about ten miles I stopped and thought wow these are actually feeling BETTER than when I started! From there on I hunted in these for about 60 miles with close to 20 thousand verticle feet(checked by GPS). They were great! I have had two neuromas removed from my feet and soft shoes are a must have. These have been the best boots even against my Danners at half the weight and a quarter of the price. They also have great traction in all conditions. In wet deep grass they will get wet inside. They also don't stink inside unlike older boots of this type. Will I buy another pair? Well I'm shopping for another pair to replace these right now."
81735,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
163124,1,"What else can I say? Converse's Chuck Taylor High-Tops have been tried and true for decades. They are comfortable, fun and in my case, red. I am 51 years young and I receive more compliments on these shoes than any other item of apparel that I own. Love them."
292113,1,Have worn Softspots in the past as a nursing shoe and found them to be very comfortable. This casual style is every bit as comfortable and true to size. The only drawback I could find is in the arch support. It could be a bit firmer.
341951,1,"I adore these shoes. It is so hard to find a nice pair of comfortable dress shoes. I hate high heels, and someone on the internet recommended these to me. I now have 3 pairs. You can dress them up or down, they are perfect for work with a pair of slacks, and best of all you can walk around A LOT without your feet hurting."
48595,1,"I have arch issues, (I.E. plantar fasica, bone spurs)I find these sneakers dissipate shock and provide the best support Iv found in any prev. sneaker,I would recomend this sneaker to anyone. John"
120865,1,These are the best stability running shoes I have ever had. I just keep buying them over and over...
330226,1,"This is a very comfortable well wearing shoe. This is my second purchase. When the time comes to buy another new pair of shoes, if these are still available, I WILL buy another pair. My only problem was that the liner in my first pair wore out, after two years, before the rest of the shoe."
352748,1,"I love them----but I hate that you can not keepthem tied. There should be a material used sothat you are able to tie them. I feel I have to cutthe cord and knot the cord. Other than that, theyare great. They are compfy and well sized."
107986,1,This are wonderful well made and resistant work shoes. I order this for a friend of mine in honduras and she is very happy with them.
280250,1,This is a well made and comfortable boot. I have them in the rich brown also that I bought out West. I wear them with jeans or a country looking dress or denim skirt...sharp looking AND comfortable!
186703,0,Recently had to have a brace for my foot. Needed a 4EEEE. Ordered this shoe in a 4EEEE but this shoe is doing good to be a 1E. Kept them to wear the one on the good foot and bought another pair from Payless shoes that were half the price.
215278,1,"I've been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon. They, of course, had it and i ordered it immediately. It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove."
318999,0,"Good looking shoe that was well made. It was the right size, but just didn't fit. I had to return the shoes. I have a very narrow foot that is hard to fit."
320376,1,"This are super confortable shoes if you do not mind the 'men' look. Great with pants. Wear for 8h or longer with no pain, padding is extraordinary. The brown is beautiful."
202585,0,The left show was not assembled evenly when compared to the right. Had to return them. Its a shame because they are the best boat shoes I was able to find.
7071,1,I first ordered these slippers for Christmas 2010 as a gift for husband. He liked them so much that he wore them almost every day. Even though they are still in good shape (a plus) I ordered him another pair for Christmas 2011 in a slightly different color. He was thrilled to get them. My only issue is that the price for these went up almost 100% from last year. But I still consider them a great buy.
366558,1,I absolutely love these shoes. This is actually my second pair of them. My first ones were starting to get old and worn so I wanted to get a new pair while they are still around. They're SO comfortable and very sexy.
97786,1,"i've always hated seeing people wear these shoes out in town as a regular shoe... but i got a pair after a training deployment to Thailand and blew out 2 pairs of flipflops (shower shoes) walking over gravel and dirt going to and from the showers. I got the Realtree cammo special just to be different from everyone else and i love them for what they are. great on the beach, at the river, around the yard and house. i just wish they made the XXXXL in white. id really like to get a white pair in my size for my dads wedding comming up later this year. hes getting married on a boat on the river and were all doing a casual dress up.all in all, great shoe. but i still wont wear them out in town."
99799,1,I love Birkenstocks! They are so comfortable and they wear well. I've bought two so far and walked in them all around the world.
343910,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
337048,1,They looked great when i got them and are still holding up good. This coming from someone that wears out shoes like no other. haha
153931,0,can someone tell me if this uggs are real i need to know asap so i can buy them so can anyone reply fast plz
99469,1,"Love these shoes. Have had for a couple months now. Well constructed, fits nice and snug. I wanted something like a tennis shoe, but without the hassle of laces. A little less supportive and less cushioned than tennis shoes, but that's OK, I'm not running or standing for long periods of time with them. I use them as my kick-arounds, and the white is nice."
147520,1,"This shoe provides excellent stability. It's very comfortable and roomy enough for orthotics, but it is quite heavy and clunky looking."
268758,1,"This was a gift for my father on fathers day. He tells me they are very comfortable. So I guess according to him, these are very good sneakers."
75264,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
28905,1,"I didn't notice the buckle when I ordered, but the shoe fits so well that the little extra time involved doesn't bother me at all. I ordered it in red (not a bright true red, but toned-down - think medium rust with touch of pink and chocolate). It will go with most things in my closet. Propet is a wonderful shoe - I have a similar sandal in tan with two velcro straps and a closed back (a ""tennis shoe"" sandal), and a boot with 2"" heel. All are very comfortable - at this age, the most important detail in footwear!"
99494,2,"I ordered these shoes for work beauce of a number of positive reviews I'd read about them, however, these are not walking shoes! They make my feet ache just walking to and from the bus stop which is right down the street. They haven't much cushioning, had to buy inserts but in doing so make them extremely tight. The only feature I do like is the easy slide on/off. Do NOT buy these if you do a lot of walking.Still searching for the right shoe. So far, Nike Air Max has provded the best results (for me).Hope this review helps."
114139,1,After wearing 574 for a few years I decided to try the another retro show the 420. While the show is nice looking and flexible. There is very little padding compared to the 574s I have had. I will wear the shoes till they wear out but will go back to 574s for my next shoe.
65398,1,They are about 2 sizes larger than I wear.But for long rides they serve good to keep the feet protected.
352202,1,"Absolutely beautiful boot and can't wait to wear them. We don't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can. Sorry I can't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport, I doubt I will be disappointed."
367734,0,"The black version of the Itasca SeaRay Slides arrived on time and in a box. They fit and are moderately comfortable. For the $30 or so shipped, they are about what i would expect. But, these are not some deeply discounted irregulars or end of line, though they may actually be. The are worth the $24.99. The smell of rubber was dominant when i opened up the box. there is no more than a flat piece of thin material separating the rubber from the removable insert. They are light and do fit comfortably but do not , by any means compare to the other higher line mocs that happen to go on some drastic sale and if i am lucky enough to find my size at the same time they go on sale-once every 3years. maybe. So, these seemed to be ok out of the box. i am wearing them and went for a walk without them breaking down and without getting any blisters. They do have a nice back for the achilles tendon and some foam in it with a center portion cut down for easier entry and removal, not much support but a nicer addition. there are elastic gores on each side with very little stretch to them but fine. my size was on target.the only real issue was that these were no way first quality or regular. there are glue spots all over the toe and fronts of both shoes. not little ones but sizable and 4 on one shoe and a couple on the other. they do not come off. At first , i thought it was only dust from shipping or a shelf storage. only it didnt come off with a light brushing nor with some water on a cloth. For me, it isnt a big deal because i always spill something i am cooking on my new shoes the first time i wear them anyway. I cant help it, always have, I used to cook for a living and now for amusement so am used to having a couple of oil spots on everything. Some people might be put off by the glue drips. I dont really mind but would normally want to be the one who gets the first spots or stains on my shoes (or shirts) thinking that this time I will keep them in perfect shape for more than a day.For the price i paid ,no problem, had i paid the 'full price' listed on the screen of $60, i would have returned them today-the day i got them."
340672,1,"Oh man I'd forgotten how easy these are to wear! Make sure and get 1 size smaller, they do run big no matter what they say at the shoe store. A classic that never goes out of style. I hadn't had a pair in years and these are rapidly becoming my ""go to"" pair of shoes.PLUS THEY'RE JUST PLAIN COOL!!"
26233,1,"This really is the best shoe I have found for training on pavement. It is very cushioned, and I notice less leg pain than with the various kinds I was trying before these. It wears like iron - I get probably 50% more life than from a pair than from other trainers I have used. Part of that is due to the fact that the uppers are still made with real animal hides, not synthetic. I put 600 miles on my last pair and visually it looked almost brand new.Oh, the best part: they're one of the few shoes still made in the USA by American workers."
246297,1,I took everyone's advice and ordered two sizes larger than I normally wear. The boots fit perfectly and are very warm.
233614,1,"Maybe I'm biased. Although, I doubt it. I was 12 when i first wore a pair of Ipath Grasshoppers when a buddy offered them to me.I picked these up from amazon and they've become my go to shoe.Pros:The insole is great, the gum sole doesn't have too many spots where rocks can wedge themselves in, the tongue is thinner than most other skate shoes i've owned from Circa and Supra. Pockets in the tongues of the shoes.Cons:The Strap doesn't come off, and when it's unstrapped the shoe kind of shifts better. It's great though"
91900,0,This shoe is bigger than any other size 9 I own... by at least a full size.
256484,1,AS ADVERTISED ! ! ! !shipped fast.! ! !no problems ! ! !very comfy ! ! !
354272,0,"I found these boots to be very comfortable - I wore them almost everyday for all kinds of activities. I initially started with the Stealth II boot, also with the side zip. When the zipper broke after a few months, I got them replaced with another Stealth II. These lasted longer, but when the zipper broke on that, the guy at the local shop said I might have more luck with the first generation boot (the ones here) because the zipper seems to be sturdier. I liked these boots more, but the zipper ended up failing on these as well.Now, I was very careful to treat the zipper well, especially on the third pair, but it failed nonetheless. I ended up buying more Magnum boots, but I won't buy boots with the side zip again."
58305,1,"I used to have a keds as a kid and I wasn't sure whether I would want a shoe that I had during my childhood. I don't regret anything about these shoes, they are just as comfortable as I remembered them."
150516,1,I loved the super soft leather and the fact that these shoes come in wide sizes. They would br 5 stars if the soles were thicker to give more cushion.
82562,1,"Great shoes in all facets except for the insoles detaching from the shoe. I just bought some of those Dr. Scholl's to keep them down and attached. Overall, not a deal breaker."
267847,1,"Soy gu&iacute;a de turismo en Costa Rica, mi trabajo exige largas caminatas en bosque, ciudad, playas, senderos, etc. Por tener tantos meses de lluvia siempre he usado botas hi-tec impermeables y no tengo queja alguna, los &uacute;ltimos 2 pares los he tenido que cambiar porque se me gasta la suela! C&oacute;modas, ajuste perfecto, livianas, muy resistentes, y con un precio accesible!El env&iacute;o fue mejor de lo esperado.Pura vida!"
257564,0,The shoe runs a bit on the narrow side but over all I am pleased with the product.
388905,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
232597,1,"They are extremely comfortable and lightweight! Perfect for walking, running, or shopping! I was so pleased that I ordered a second pair for 13 year old daughter that wanted to take them over!"
226687,1,I loved these shoes when I got them. They Rock. The company Dress Code is great also they were really good to me when I received my shoes unfortunately they didn't fit so I had to return them for a pair one size bigger. Anyway I didn't have the money at that time to send them back right away so I told them I would send them back as soon as I got paid and to my surprise a few days later I received a prepaid return label from them it was great. Now I am able to send them back right away I am very happy with everything.
220122,1,"Sure, Keds aren't made like they were back in the day, but for the price you really can't complain. I got these to wear casually since I didn't want to shell out double the amount for similar shoes, and I love them! There's no arch support, but that's nothing some insoles can't solve. After a few months of wear [even to dances and the gym], my Keds still look pretty new. However, beware people with wider feet! These shoes are a but narrow in the toe area."
380191,0,"I got the black Women's size 7 tap shoes and they look nice. The heel was just the right height, but no taps included?! They weren't put on the shoes nor were they included in the box. This is weird. Now I notice that the photo in amazon featured just the shoes with no taps. I should've been more observant! Now I have to purchase the taps from a specialty dance store and go to a shoe repair shop to have the taps put on professionally. Beware."
105979,1,"These shoes are a classic and are very comfortable, but, you have to be careful or they will rip. mine ripped in the first month"
66429,1,"I just got my pair of Boots today in the mail. I was actually expecting them to arrive Jan.4th-Han.8th, but they came two days earlier ! So, I was very surprised and happy about that. At first when I opened the box, I thought they were used because the shoe box was all ""worn out"" and stuff, but the shoes weren't used. They are actually cuter than they appear on the picture. I love them. THey are sooo comfy and they look great on me unlike my friend's Emu Boots. The sole is the strong-durable like kind. Made of rubber, and you can roll the top of the boots so the fur on the inside will show. I was going to get a size 8 but they werent available so I got a size 7.5 instead. They fit perfectly. Still leaving room for my toes to wiggle around. They are amazing. They came early, they were a great price- I think mine were around $15-$19! That's a great deal for brand new boots like these. I really like them. Thank You !"
108960,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear.

143700,1,"Great SHoes, nice quality, not to mention comfortable as well.Will buy this brand again. Great Price TOO!! which is always a factor when you are shopping for yourself. Purchased 2 pairs, one pair black, and the other pair brown. Excellent service and received the shoes within a few days. Will buy shoes again here at amazon!! Great dealing with them, have never had any problems ...at all!!!! It is really nice to shop from home too."
287840,1,the t-mac 3 is a great shoe it looks so niceand is very comftorble. I have 2 pairs the white and the black becauce i like thoughs more then then the blue and red. And just let you guys now the black ones have better traction then the white.DA T-MAC 3s ARE DA BEST!
91970,1,They are not only made well but comfortable and durable. Timberland makes a good product and they last (my last pair must have been 10yrs +). Throw in a good price and you can't loose.
38512,1,I purchased this item and the very next day I received it at my door step. You can't go wrong with Timberland and the price was great.
118342,1,"Once I got the size straight they worked out great. The wide, medium and narrow threw me off. Ended up with the next size up and medium width for a good fit.She loves them."
42113,1,"I am delighted with this product. previously bought addias trainers,but found these are lite, hard wearing and very comfortable . After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented "" Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their "" . which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man. EXCELLLANT PRODUCT."
230375,1,"I purchased these boots for my cousin in England, who has trouble finding such a large size in a hunting boot. He said these boots are wide enough for his feet ( he usually wears 15W )eventhough they read Medium. He also said these boots are the best for keeping his feet warm while out in the fields in temperatures well below freezing. The fleecy type coating on the inside keeps feet dry and warm.He did comment one thing though......he said he spray paints the yellow strip around the boot, purely because it stands out too bright for real hunters like him. I do not have a clue as I am a City kid!!!!In any case, the boots are the best of the best and he is a World Champion Shooter.....Great Purchase indeed."
84344,1,"Love them, when going out with my kids, terrific slippers. They are SO EASY to clean and dry. Very comfortable and resistant. Went to the Igua&uacute; Waterfalls in the Brazilian/Argentinian border and used them all the time in my walks at the park.What a breakthrough invention in materials!! This crocs are a must for everyone who needs some cheap, comfortable and all purpose sandals/shoes."
203355,1,"Shoe is true to size. There is cushioning on the sole and it is so comfortable. I literally ended up at an event for 12 hours in these shoes and my feet didn't hurt they were so comfortable. They are cute I wear them a lot with jeans and sun dresses. The blend in very well despite the pattern. They are fun, with a buckle detail and pony hair construction. Love them !"
148537,1,"Love my Mocs....have worn them since I was a kid. Love the colorand the fit, as always, is perfect. The sole makes it easier towalk outside. Love them!!!"
159051,2,"I ordered this item two weeks ago. I ordered a size 11 and got a 7.5. Went through the hassle of getting a refund, repackaging and shipping the item. Then I ordered a new pair after being assured that I would receive the right size. However ONCE AGAIN THE SHOES ARRIVED IN A SIZE 7.5. This is ridiculous. Please beware, don't waste your time."
16415,1,"The copa mundial has been the best selling soccer boot for the last 20 plus years. There is a reason for it. First, the styling is simple and elegant. Three white stripes and that it. My cleats have last over 10 years and then i bought the exact pair again. Why? The comfort and fit. The Kangaroo skin leather stretches to molds to your foot for a permanent custom fit. Try them and you will become a believer. They are the gold standard of soccer boots."
378332,1,I bought these for my daughter's spring musical. They fit great and she's been able to break them in during rehearsals. You definitely need to order a half-size larger than street shoes.
329609,1,Greatest Most durable boots I've ever purchased. I'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid. All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost. I'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting.
9222,1,I ordered these in a wide width because the regular ones always seem to make my feet hurt. They are comfortable.
370618,1,"These are absolutely wonderful! So comfortable and easy to walk and stand in, can wear them all day! Sizing is accurate. Delivery was right on time."
237831,1,"Impressive work.As a person living in singapore,i'm not exposed to this brand at all. I see red wings everywhere and it seems over rated and pricey.Everybody's wearing it because its a trend.I slip my feet in this throgood boots and it feels awesome.No breaking in as the leather is already soft and comfortable.Good job!"
206300,1,"My little 20 month old grandson has a short wide foot, and the little Navy crocs fit him perfectly - plus he can put them on himself! Thanks"
164915,1,My order was processed and shipped in amazing time. Thanks so much for your 5 Star Service
103266,1,"I was paranoid that the shoes would be tight but stuck with the size 10 since my daughter had just gotten a few new pairs of street shoes in 10s. We always err on the larger size so that shoes will last for a bit! She just wore them to her first ballet class and the shoes were perfect, with a little room to grow. She even wore them w/out tights since I didn't have them yet, and was perfectly comfortable. I always wore Capezio shoes for ballet throughout my childhood and will certainly stick with the brand for my daughter."
47920,1,"My husband and I LOVE these sandals! They are great in the garden, great on the rocks on the beach, and are joyfully comfortable. Toes are protected, they dry VERY quickly, and convert easily to ""with or without"" a heel strap. Also massage your heels and provide arch support. incredibly comfortable too!"
100347,0,"I ordered two pairs of shoes for a musical: one black pair and one white pair. The black pair wore wonderfully, but the white pair broke a strap and when cleaned the coating peeled off the shoe."
252358,1,"These are my son's favorite and he swears by their quality. They don't fall apart like other brands he has tried and believe me, he is hard on them. He likes the fact that the soles don't come apart from the uppers."
318288,0,"Good looking shoe that was well made. It was the right size, but just didn't fit. I had to return the shoes. I have a very narrow foot that is hard to fit."
307377,1,"Fantastic quality,comfortable and most important they are an asset to any wardrobe. This boot is by far my favorite pair of boots."
145344,1,"These are the best boots ever! Most comfortable, warmest, durable! I started my search for boots after playing in the Wisconsin snow with my daughter and my feet were frozen. I probably had not played in the snow since I was a kid. I researched these ordered them and now have 2 pair that have lasted 2 years no problems. Be aware order a size smaller! I am usually a 6.5 I ordered a 6 and they work great but my friend order a 9 (she is usually a 8.5 and hers are too big!) I read in the description to order smaller she didn't read that. The cost is worth it the quality is superior to anything out there!"
80579,1,"Converse All Star are made to feel comfortable, this kind of shoes is never out of fashion, with jeans or shorts, wit t-shirts or shirts, once you wear a pair you will wish to have all of them."
16723,1,"comfortable, reliable, and it preforms. In today's game, the classics are what stand out. Everyone is wearing neon green, pink, plastic shoes that will be popular for a month then fade. Oh and they cost $400. This boot will never stop preforming and looking great."
200416,1,This is a great shoe at a very competitive price. Shipment was quick and I could not be more pleased!
312827,1,"My wife got a pair of these crocs and absolutely loved them so I figured I would give them a try and I purchased a pair myself. They are the most comfortable shoe to wear. They look nice, they hold up well, they are so light and they massage your feet while you walk because they have all these little bubbles inside. I purchase them before we went on vacation and loved them because they can get wet or anything and can't hurt them. You really need to try a pair of crocs. You won't be disappointed."
284396,1,"I had not had a new pair of Birkenstocks in 20 or so years and these arrived I opened them up ,put them on and all was good with the world."
212922,1,"Naturalizer Scout ShoesI have been looking for another pair of these shoes for years now. Not carried in our local stores. I didn't know they still made them. I had two pairs which I wore until they wore out. I will be ordering more, so keep them stocked. I hope they keep making them! I have feet that are very hard to fit, so that the Velcro strap helps. So does the design and comfortable heels. But I mustn't praise them too much or you'll be all sold out next time I want to buy a pair."
163636,0,"I bought these shoes to complete my cheerleading costume for a special event. They looked Great!Customizable: The color blocks are easy to interchange, they tie into the laces, so they stay well, too.Size: The shoes were very comfortable, and I found them true to size - I wear an 8 1/2, and I bought the size 9. As with running shoes, I find that you should always go up at least a 1/2 size to account for the forward motion, and they fit perfectly. There was a little extra room, as expected, but when jumping around in them, I found them to be great.Traction: My only concern was that there was little to no traction. This may not matter for your use of the shoes, but I was wearing them on a slick dance floor, and when someone spilled a drink, I fell pretty hard. If using on a track surface, grass, or other ""standard"" cheerleading materials, this may not be a concern for you."
188760,1,This is my second pair. The tops outlast the bottoms but they are good quality. I have a c width foot so they are good for me. Everyone likes different sneakers for fit and quality. These are made well and will last about a year of daily use. I am satified with them and will keep buying them. Rob
231416,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
228362,1,"I love my Converse Chucks! glad a picked grey, goes with alot of stuff. I usually wear a 9 or 8& half n my chucks fit fine :) happy with my purchase!"
307428,1,"I was somewhat wary of buying shoes online without trying them on first, but figured that Easy Spirit typically offered a great fit in most of their styles of shoes. These shoes were no exception. I was pleasantly surprised at the softness of the uppers and support offered by the soles. These will be great shoes to wear to work as I am on my feet for the majority of the workday."
93546,1,"These are my second pair. I wore out the first ones. It took me 4 years to do it, but they are definitely worth the money."
218280,1,These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. The price was the best I've seen anywhere. I couldn't be happier.
271152,1,"These shoes are smart looking and can take you anywhere! I had to get a double wide to accommodate my ""flip-flops all my life"" wide feet, but they are like walking on pillows! Comfort at a decent price!"
80317,1,"Was very thankful these arrived so soon after ordering,was a last minute item...and my daughter loves them....she now has 2 pairs..and is planning on collecting them for different colors....Thank youShelia Sale/VA"
356296,1,"Character shoes were in great shape, clean, fit nicely, and had no marks. Comfortable and great to dance in.Overall, very happy with them."
71129,1,"its only good if you get the right size, if you don't it might break on you."
195437,1,"The Playful Pumps are so neat! I got the turqoise color ones and everyone loves them!! I have to agree with the other reviewer, I am hooked on Naughty Monkey shoes!! The are so different than other pumps that they grab the attention of others. What is also cool is that if you check carefully, you can get really good deals on them though Amazon. Just want to warn others, these shoes run a little big!! I have some in size 9 and they are a little too big. Whereas the 8 1/2 works great! I wear a size nine in other shoes and I have a medium size foot. Just wanted to let everyone know!!"
252874,0,"even more than a size too long does not fit across instep/ball if foot. what happened to my feet or these shoes? I lived in these back in the 70s, so comfortable. so sad :-("
39756,1,"These flips are the best! Comfy and cute! Plus, if they get dirty I just throw them in the washer!"
195010,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
232171,1,"Excelentes zapatos, buen dise&ntilde;o, livianos, comodos , buen precio, tiempo de env&iacute;o muy bueno, recomendado para utilizar con vestimenta sport o jean."
310131,1,just an FYI - these things wear a size smaller than what you normally wear (i.e. i wear a 9M and ordered an 8M that fit perfectly)
386106,1,"I got my first pair about 3 years ago. This shoes is probably the most comfortable and durable model, I think I have ever come across. The style is so versatile that with just a simple color change it looks like a completely different shoe. Perfect for long distance running, although I do have to agree with a previous reviewer in the fact that the only think that needs to be fixed is the tread which wear a little thin. But the shoe is so perfectly designed that the tread really does not affect your running.Awesome shoe!"
76556,1,"this is a good sturdy sandal that supports my high arches. It brings relief after wearing other shoes and when my legs and back ache, it comforts."
13724,1,"Buen producto, por el precio excelente, envi&oacute; oportuno, en empaque adecuado, recomendable!!Buen producto, por el precio excelente, envi&oacute; oportuno, en empaque adecuado, recomendable!!"
82101,1,Basic loafer at a good price of $49.00 Look great. Nice thing about ordering online is they are NOT used as store samples as most small sizes are so they are completely NEW. Felt broken in after only one day
161761,1,"I was fitted for a pair of these at a speciality running store and purchased them with a gift card for over $100. I jog/walked a marathon in these a few months ago and they were great--no blisters, no nothing. I would definately purchase these shoes again, especially at the prices offered by Amazon!!!!"
96576,1,"Love them, I have 2 pair.I never expected to pay so little and get so much"
262255,1,"I ordered these for Halloween. Shipping was quick and arrived well before the estimated due date. My shoe size is an 8 and typically doesn't vary depending on the shoe, but I should have ordered a half size smaller in these. They were suprisingly comfortable for having a five inch heel and fit my calves and thighs perfectly."
856,1,"I purchased these hiking boots for a month-long trip to China which was going to include a lot of hiking and not a lot of packing space. Aside from the initial try on when first receiving these boots in the mail I did not wear these boots in before setting off to China, with any other boots this might have been a poor choice. My first experience of these boots then was on a 15 mile hike on the Great Wall, up rough terrain and through some snow, and at the end of the day my feet felt fine. These shoes seem to have really great support without being constrictive. They are comfortable, durable, waterproof, and best of all for me, they are warm without causing my feet to sweat, even during rigorous activity.Another plus for me was these shoes odor fighting powers, despite being worn for 30 days straight, often without a fresh change of socks due to lack of laundry facilities, they wore very well. These shoes have been everywhere from strange nightclubs in Beijing to open-air markets in Tibet and continue to be sturdy and functional boots. I would recommend for anyone looking for a versatile and comfortable boot for your next adventure."
28230,1,My teenage daughter got these over a year ago - they are a little discolored now from lots of abuse - but are holding up great! No separation of the sole - no rips or tears. Even the laces have held up!
47745,1,"Just an impressive product. Comfortable, easy to wear, pick the right color and they kind of go with anything. I am just a comfort guy when it comes to shoes and clothes. I put these on at home, when i go out to the store, whatever. They fit right based on the description they give, delivery was right on time and the price was right. No complaints!"
329997,1,I wear them every single day. I work at home so they get lots of use.Need a new pair about once a year.I have over 20 pairs of shoes and these are my favorites.
43117,1,"I love my Mary Jane Croc's! I have walked up and down pavement in them, to wearing them around the house like slippers. They have kept my feet warm without socks at early morning soccer games and kept them cool on a humid night. The color is also great because it goes with everything!My kids have said ""Boy, mom, you really like your crocs, huh?"" Yes I do!"
209777,1,"I purchased these along with a brown and brushed letter, The boots are as described. I was a little worried about the fit but had done my homework. The size was right and the boots are very comfortable. In fact, I have not not worn my regular dress shoes much since I purchased these. The more I wear them, the more comfortable they are."
95125,1,"For quick moving feet and an improved jump shot pick up the dunk-feast a3 adidas b-bal shoe, you will not find a better fit. Great support for lower ankles and arches. Over all great shoe"
219798,1,Ordered these for my granddaughter who is thrilled. They arrived in a short amount of time. Great service.
224997,1,"The shoes arrived quickly, size was correct and shoes were exactly what we needed! Price was lower than any of the local vendors! Thanks!"
305925,1,Have worn Softspots in the past as a nursing shoe and found them to be very comfortable. This casual style is every bit as comfortable and true to size. The only drawback I could find is in the arch support. It could be a bit firmer.
50844,0,I love love love Jessica Simpson shoes so didn't even second guess purchasing these.They fit great but just feel a little bit cheap compared to her other shoes.I wish I liked them better.
163303,1,"These are well made, very sturdy if you have problems with thin heels. They could use a bit of padding in the shoe, the inside is quite hard, would definitely recommend some gel inserts or such type thing."
383049,2,"I wore these slippers for about one week. One morning while wearing them, my right foot felt like the material inside the shoe was twisted. I looked down at the shoe to see what the problem was, and much to my surprise, part of my foot was hanging out the side of the slipper! The seam had split where the top and side were stitched together. Very disappointed!"
312007,1,Nicely manufactured boot. Sturdy and functional. Leather is stiff upon first wearing but that adds the longevity of the boot.Will purchase again in the future.
194387,1,I received my Scout Sandal very quickly. It was in perfect shape and fit just like was supposed to.I am very pleased with the service and the product.
97955,1,I was careless jogging down a boat ramp.My attention was diverted.My croc Beach Clog changed ownership to a dock cleat !!!
369582,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
198720,1,"I love my Converse shoes. I know my size and I know that they will fit. Needless to say, when the shoes arrived they were in great condition! They fit. No problems and no need for a return or exchange."
170067,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
142772,1,I got this boots for an excellent price. I had tried them at the store first and I got the same product but at a lower price online
286589,1,I absolutely love these 'sandals' and have received many compliments. Will purchase again and in every color available.
383293,2,"this shoe was unusually wide for A width, thus I had to return. Returnining is always a pain for me."
236855,1,"Keds have always been good sneakers. These seem to have lived up to that. Since they are white, they did not wash well but I discovered if you dry them in the dryer, the streaks that show up when you air dry them disappear."
4056,1,"The quality of this shoe is much better than I expected. The leather is high quality, the overall design is nice and fits well. Very pleased!"
10433,1,"I danced for years as a kid, and these split sole capezios were one of my favorite types. They don't shape to your feet as well as leather shoes, but they hold up a little longer (and because my toes are on a slant/angle, the shape looks better anyway). I ordered a 10.5 as other buyers complained they ran small, but they ended up being true to size - I am a street shoe size 10 and needed size 10 for these shoes. I had to exchange them, and the exchange process was hassle free and quick - had the new shoes within a few days."
326694,1,"I love these so much. When my last pair died, I bought them here. When that pair dies, I'll buy more. I hope they never stop making them."
202633,1,"these are the best boat shoes so well made, even wet, non slip on deck or dock I have several pairs, and these have more support in sole and arch, good price too."
52701,0,"I got these, put them on, pulled the laces tight (once) one of the brass supports for the laces broke off immediately. Not the hooks, the main lace supports further toward the bottom. Other than that it felt comfortable for the next 15 seconds while I gazed confusedly at my broken pair of new shoes."
238504,1,"I keep a typical bi-fold wallet in my briefcase but also maintain a slim wallet to use for going out to dinner, movies, shopping, etc. This wallet is perfect. Cash compartment, 3 slots for cards, and a clear sleeve for your identification card. Slips flatly into a front or back pocket. Perfect!!"
352165,0,This shoe boot is okay for the money but I discovered the Timberland outlet where you can buy a much better quality shoe book for the same price as these. If you can't locate a Tim' outlet then these will do fine.
167430,1,"This is the perfect slip-on sneaker. I bought the plain black before and was very happy with the fit and comfort. I thought the black/silver would dress it up a little and give it more diversity. I was right. Also, the Amazon price could not be beat. I would recommend this shoe highly."
160130,1,"These shoes were exactly what my son wanted for Christmas. He loves them. They run true to size and they are comfortable. He has a hard time keeping the tongue straight on the shoes. When he tightens the laces, it will stay in place."
150160,1,This is the second pair of these shoes I've purchased. They are comfortable right out of the box without a break in period.
316526,1,"I absolutely love these shoes! The are dressier than normal sport shoes, but just as comfortable. I even wear them with dress pants to work in a bank, where I am on my feet all day. They are also true-to-size, so order with confidence."
60095,1,These boots feel and fit great. I am interested in how long they will hold up. They look pretty sturdy. I will put them to the test for sure.
201787,1,These are nice they were for my wife and she loves them.My wife swears by them this is all she will wear
210187,1,"It is very hard to find cute, tall heels in wide and Nine West has been my savior with these shoes! I have already worn them on several occasions and loved them. They were a tiny bit big, but I got some insoles that go just under the ball of your foot and they made the shoes more comfortable and perfectly snug. I am not the type of person to say that any heel is actually comfortable, but I wore these to two weddings and didn't have any blisters, even after dancing. I would recommend these shoes to anyone, but especially to people who are looking for wide high heels for special occasions. These are wonderful! Thank you, Nine West."
275061,2,Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price. I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction. I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time.
324873,1,"great flats! Compact and small for those who have too many shoes already. The only thing with these shoes are the elastic part starts hurting the back of my my foot, but only happens if you wear them for a long period of time."
69530,1,My husband wanted a pair of crocs for an upcoming fishing trip. I purchased the XL for him as he's a size 10 1/2 - 11. They fit him perfectly and the color is just right (khaki). So far so good.....The crocs were put to use on a recent fishing trip and worked great.
113963,1,"I am very pleased with the shoe. I like the look and it is very comfortable. My only complaint is that, for some reason, the shoe strings tend to come untied periodically. If I make sure the knot is really tight, they seem OK. Otherwise, I really like the shoe. If you get them shined, make sure to use a neutral color shoe polish, because there is white stitching."
196415,1,"EXCELLENT BUY. I'M ENJOYING MY SHOES AND I'M FEELING LIKE WILL SMITH, JE JEEEEE. I RECEIVED MY SHOES IN THE OFFICIAL CONVERSE BOX. THEY ARE ORIGINAL AND TOTALLY NEW."
248391,2,"I have not yet received this product, the estimated date of arrival was on the 14th of this Month. And when I attempt to track I get no where, no one is available to answer my concerns..... so right now I don't know how I feel about this product! Would be nice if someone could give me a call so I could get an idea when to expect my merchandise I have already paid for."
255843,0,"Although I love the style of shoe, when I ordered, the size configuration was confusing. I ordered what I thought was a 10 M and I received a 10 W. What is ""10 E 2""? As a result, I can't use these shoes, but didn't realize the sizing was not what I thought I ordered until I wore them for a day outside. As a result, I don't feel I can return them."
28175,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
354117,1,I have had two pairs of these boots. The boots are very comfortable and are sized right for my foot. I use these boots in the snow and also when I go fishing. The waterproofing works very well. In my opinion a very good boot for price.
73658,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
334122,1,"It's funny that I ordered these, because I've always thought them to be quite ugly. My friend was wearing them and I tried them on. Very comfortable, and the look nice enough to wear to the office as a causal dress look (I work in a very relaxed environment). Amazon shipped fast and low cost."
169706,1,This number is absolute comfort for walking.....much admired here in New Zealand.
89034,1,"I am on my fourth pair of the Asic 2070. I wore it to train and walk in a 3-Day 60 mile walk for breast cancer. All my teammates had miserable blisters and shinsplints on the walk, all except myself and one another teammate. We were wearing the Asic 2070. Although made for running, the Asic 2070 is comfortable, durable and light weight, all the important features in a shoe for a serious walker."
187081,1,I got this for my husband for his birthday. He LOVES it. Very nice in style and function. Makes a great gift.
35723,1,Great basketball shoe! Lots of cushion. DMX feels good! The value is probably the biggest thing that sold me on the shoe.
130667,1,"This was a great product. Unfortunately, the shoes were too large and I had to return them. Sorry."
178797,1,"the chucks, of course their cool, comfy and fun. I love the color, haven't seen anyone else walking the street with these yet! My only complaint is that they are a little to big. I usually wear a size 8 and would be pushing it to be in a 7.5. I want these for comfort so I ordered an 8. Too long. Looks a little goofy. Order a size smaller than you usually would or they will likely be too long."
362962,0,These are quite warm and comfy. I got them for $3 on sale. I wouldn't pay more than that for them. They have non slip grips things on the bottom which I hate. They don't wash well (the non slip things - they always seem to stay kind of gray) They are a tad loose and do shed a bit. But they are very soft and I would buy them again for under $3 probably.
229454,1,I've been wearing Samba Classic for over 30 years. This order arrived quickly and the quality was as expected.
247118,1,"I have a tendency to stick with what works. I wear this brand and style 90% of my workdays. I wear them out. HOwever, they always last a good length of time. This is my third pair in 5 years, and I just love the classic style. They are a pain to break in though. Litterally."
201769,1,"Awsome,great,amazing,and the best present ever&#10069;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;&#128515;I LOVE these shoes Taft wifi ug suing dfhv rids rhgyv shift rfbkgx that's trove eigcst"
273998,1,"I bought my puma's on amazon like 4 years ago, before everyone else started wearing them. I can't stand big giant basketball shoes with velcro, and springs that look like space boots. If you want nice casual kicks you need to get some pumas. They have tons of cool colors and you can't go wrong with black. Who doesn't love these."
284782,1,"These shoes are great. I'm a heavy weight runner, and these make running less taxing on my knees. The also look nice."
312398,1,Definitely the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn! No breaking in. I put them on and never took them off. Love them!
38885,2,"I purchased a pair of Sketchers Men's Alley Cat Utility Oxford blacks and they wore out in less than four months. The heel collar is rubbing off and the rubber outsole is ripping apart from the inner leather sole resulting in the shoes flapping like a pair of flip-flops. The initial wearing of the shoe was painful, pinching at pressure points on the foot. After breaking the shoes in they wore more comfortably, but obviously not for very long. These shoes are an American company brand but are manufactured in China. Given the price and American name brand I expected a little more quality control. I am very disappointed!"
377242,0,"I have always liked Danner boots my last pair were the most comfortable boots I had ever worn the Men's Recon though are ""to long"" the ""toe is to pointed"" and there is ""zero arch support"" the little plastic insert they send along is an insult, unfortunately they are awkward and uncomfortable."
224835,1,NOTHING CAN EVER TAKE THE PLACE OF A TRIED & TRUE PAIR OF CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STARS. (WE CALLED THEM BO-BOS IN THE 70'S)
69373,1,"Times have now changed, however, and now I wear these around the house. When outside, I wear slip-free restaurant-style Croc look-alikes and can care less what people think of me.Until I find a wider shoe, I will always be wearing Crocs as they are simply the only shoe that has ever fit me nicely due to their extremely wide profile and tons of toe clearance.I can go as far to say that they are the only shoe that looks like it matches the same anatomical shape of the foot. Think about it for a second: how many human feet are shaped to a point like almost nearly all shoes in existence today? Needless to say, my toes have never hurt when wearing these and toe pain has always plagued me throughout my life.The last four years, as of this writing, I have had major foot problems working in a restaurant and walking around. I have heel spurs on both feet and had major toe pain on both index toes and both big toes - for some reason, they would swell up considerably at the toe joint and it would prevent me from even moving them. Ever since I switched to these shoes, I never had that problem.I used to believe we should walk barefoot as much as possible in order to strengthen our feet but now, I'm thinking the opposite because we live in an industrialized world - an industrialized world requires different needs for our bodies. I'm wearing these types of shoes everywhere and will not look back."
231954,1,"My daughter wanted these timberland for Christmas, she has purchase them before so I known what she wanted. These are very nice boots"
240635,1,I ordered these shoes to take with in a carribean cruise. They were true ti size and they are very cumfortable. Cute enough to dress up or go casual.
151707,1,"extremely comfortable - light weight, good arch support - great shoes!x x x x x x x x x x x x"
38187,0,"Needed a comfortable shoe to wear to work but it needed more cushioning, when a wear my socks with it, the shoe easily slips off my feet, the insole is very slippery. Also, I wear a size 8 but it's slightly too small, should have ordered a 8.5. I like the look wish it didn't have those flaws"
289131,2,"Nice shoe except, it doesn't conform to standard sizes. I bought the 12N size shoe. My foot is A/AAA. Really narrow feet! But somehow this shoe is severely pinching my little toes. I walk on my job over 20,000 paces five nights a week. So purchasing these were a waste of money. I'm willing to try the next size up though and give you a review later. But I suspect that maybe the manufacturer is using the wrong standards (Intl in lieu of US) and should publish their sizing standards in the descriptions."
5002,1,"I run a lot as part of a running group, and whenever I do intervals or fartlek training, I wear these. They feel so light that whenever I lift my feet I feel barefoot. I also wear the Brooks Launch, which are also light, but there is no comparison. The only reason I don't wear these 100% of the time when running, is that I want more cushioning when running more than 10K at a time at a pace slower than 5:15min per kilometer, but I may also start wearing these for these runs too. Again, this is perfect as long as you have no pronation, and do not need extra cushioning. I am on my second pair and could not be happier."
91063,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. The delivery of the shoes was great and in a timely fashion, I'm sure I will order again, and the prices can't be beat!"
240682,1,"I loved these flipflops so much,and I say loved because my sister has stolen them from me because she loved them so much too! Even the straps are really soft, I find too often flip flop straps cause blisters or they just hurt but not these!"
204266,1,I bought these for my boyfriend who spends between 10-12 hours on his feet a night. In the past we always had to do inserts to try and get him through at least half the night. Now with these he is walking without discomfort all night. Great boot and I will definately buy more of these.
302909,1,I've worn these for years now and they remain the most comfortable dress shoe for the office that I have ever found.
113337,1,"shoes are supportive, and wear well on both roads and trails."
273771,0,"I gave these as a gift to my dad who sometimes has to work in the mud. He said the boots were nice but showed me how difficult they are to get off after just slipping them on, he advised me that after working in them and your feet sweating unless you have someone to pull them off- you cant get them off yourself. So i was a bit disappointed. But they are very well made and nice this is the only draw back. Also was disappointed that after i purchased them, i was researching them on another website and found them for half the cost- that did not make me happy at all."
353767,0,"excelente producto, muy comodas y elegantes, llego en buen tiempo y no hubo retraso alguno pronto he de realizar otra compra de las mismas botas."
389658,1,"100 por ciento complacido con la compra, llegaron en buenas condiciones y son de muy buena calidad. Altamente recomendados y a muy buen precio. Gracias."
237558,1,"These are so comfortable. You can barely tell they are on your feet. The bottle opener is neat, but it takes a bit to getting used to. I thought that part would be cheap, but it is solid."
91625,1,I love the lightweight shoes and the uppers last under extreme use I put them through. I do wish the soles would last a bit longer.
3914,1,Had an older pair that lasted for about 6 years. I loved them and sought to replace them with the same model. I got them and they broke in pretty quick. I am happy!
288048,1,"I really like these shoes and they are very good quality but I ordered the narrow size and find that they are still too wide. When I measure them against a pair of mediums, they seem the same."
285691,1,"These Copa's were one of the first pairs of cleats I ever purchased, well over 20 years ago. Since then I have used many other cleats but decided to go back to my roots, as it were, and use them again. They are still great shoes - supple, simple, and effective."
42461,1,I am very pleased with this product. I have bought boat shoes in the past & find them more comfortable in informal settings than exercise shoes. What I like about these shoes is having shoe strings. I paid a little of above what I normally pay but am happy with the quality of these shoes.
155449,1,"I am 60 years old and this is the first time I ever had a show I felt was so completely comfortable. They are stylish, well made, and very comfortable. They are also re-solable. My dog ate the heal of one of them and I sent it to Mephisto for reapair. $50 and it looks like new.I received the item promptly and would buy from this seller again."
127238,1,Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine for that long. I've skated them for that long too. Super comfortable when they're broken in and will last you for years. Vans for life.
383383,2,"So I ordered these shoes, thinking they would look just like the picture. I was wrong, they came exactly on the day they said they would deliver. I opened them & I was so disappointed at what I saw. The shoes were not only the color I didn't want, but also HUGE,WIDE & not what I expected. They came in a nice box though, but besides that I would not Buy these. I was so disappointed & I paid $71.00 for these? There's So many shoes out there...that you can BUY for less..& look just as good. I shouldn't' have paid this much for these shoes.."
308952,1,These moc's are really soft inside. They seem to be made very well. Great for slipping on in a hurry!
341288,1,"They are the only &#34;tennies&#34; that I wear. I just replace the old pairs with new ones == they are super comfortable, and fit me perfectly == i know just what size to get, and can wear them right out of the box. I love them!"
212129,1,"My son wore these shoes every day during the fall/winter for nearly 6 months. They were good colors to match with boys' fall clothing colors and they were so comfortable that he never tried to pull them off. He was learning to stand and walk during this period, and the shoes were perfect for this phase of his life since they let his feet move naturally. They were also great for keeping his socks on and thus keeping his feet warm during the winter months. In addition to being cute, these shoes held up incredibly well, even after being washed several times. I genuinely couldn't have bought a better shoe for him."
243782,1,"Who doesn't love a good pair of Chuck Taylors? My manfriend and I are huge fans, so I scooped him up this blacked-out pair for work (he is a bartender). Not only do they look good, but they are holding up magnificently, showing little signs of age, despite all the mixers, juice, and other bar sludge that they see on a regular basis. And because of the canvas, if they do start to smell like the floor of the bar, in the washer they go! Pricing and delivery on these bad boys was on point and I would not hesitate to get another pair from this distributor again.And, if you do not own a pair of Chucks, get on the wagon and buy a product created in the USA, my friend."
14600,0,I love the feel of this shoe but even in 7.5 it's a little snug. I might go back to Reebok.
301286,1,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The shoes are comfortable and the neutral color allows me to wear them with almost anything, shorts, skirts, sports, dresses and pants."
44500,1,I love these shoes. They are like feathers on my feet and have improved my dancing for recreation immensely.
19883,1,"I've been wearing this shoe for almost 20 years. Originally made domestically, then Portugal, then Brazil, and now Vietnam. The quality of the fit and the durability of the leather is still as good as ever. The only change I've found is that the midsole is a bit thinner. This is noticeable if you climb a lot of stairs, like I do. Still, the best shoe if you're on your feet all day and/or wear orthotics. Amen."
114170,1,"Since my first experience with Capezio 2 years ago, I've always purchased my daughter's ballet shoes from this brand. Very good quality. Reorder because she eventually outgrows them. They are true to size and fits snuggly around my daughter's feet."
57304,1,"After always wearing athletic shoes, I finally returned to my beloved Keds. They are just what I needed to wear with jeans and shorts to avoid the messy, clunky look of my big feet in athletic shoes. I really like the graphic color because it is so neutral that I think will not shoe dirt as much as white ones do."
246440,1,These are great shoes but they run a little on the small side. I usually take a 7.5 and that is what I purchased and they were too small. Next time I will order an 8 and that should be perfect. I love the shoes...
266339,1,"was given a pair of these shoes used,worked in them in my shop welding/ machining/auto & truck repair for about 6 years. very comfortable & rugged. this is why i went online @ located another pair through amazon. so far this pair is exceeding my expectations. my thanks to AMAZON & HI-TEC: heavyhaull"
365270,1,What can I say? These shoes are insanely comfortable and go with everything. The more worn they get the better they look.
133825,1,"GREAT SHOES! BRAND NEW, RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX! I LOVE THEM!"
283795,2,"Every time I've bought shoes with these rubber insert soles, they've fallen apart at the rubber-leather joint in a few months. They're terrible."
11336,1,estan muy bonito los tenis y el envio estuvo rapido y bien preparado espero que siguen haciendo un muy buen trabajo muchas gracias
130169,1,I bought these for my boyfriend who spends between 10-12 hours on his feet a night. In the past we always had to do inserts to try and get him through at least half the night. Now with these he is walking without discomfort all night. Great boot and I will definately buy more of these.
150288,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
82568,0,"The first time I put them on the leather lace broke, the next day the other lace broke. Either old leather or bad quality."
130457,1,"Everyone's foot is obviously different, because these shoes fit me perfectly (I wear a size 13-M). I was a bit concerned about buying them online without having tried a pair on first, but that concern proved to be unwarranted.I thought the Amazon price was good, as I'd seen the shoes elsewhere for upwards of $100. My girlfriend ""roped"" me into taking swing dance lessons, and I didn't want to invest a lot of money in dance shoes I may never use again.I highly recommend them to anyone who doesn't have special fitting requirements where shoes are concerned."
35540,1,I love Skecher's but have noticed that all Skecher sneakers tend to run a size small. I love their sneakers so I just get them a size bigger. Good quality shoes. I recommend them!
270760,1,"Excellent shoe, it`s perfect with almost all clothes... Fits exactly in my feet, and even though I do not use it for skateboarding, it might be an unique shoe to do so. And another thing, it`s Vans!! Needles to say more."
95423,1,My husbands third pair of this style Birkenstocks; what more can I say? He especially loves to wear these around the house.
178842,1,I got these shows and began to wear them right off to break them in. I have to say if you stand for a long period of time dont wear them. If you are weight lifting with them then they work great. They have no real arch support because they were originally made back in the day before they had arch support. But great shoes!!
234142,1,"My favorite shoe's,I were sneakers all the time & these K-Swiss ST329 have been my go to for the last 3 years.Well made quality shoes leather/rubber soles (which don't make my toes warm/hot),i think these shoes are over all great for walking,running errands,everyday life."
320293,1,I am very pleased with these boots but was disappointed when I walked into the mall to find these boots $30.00 cheaper. I have been wanting another pair since high school and I found them on here. Free shipping was offered on this item which was a bonus.
308802,1,"After wearing out two pairs of the Kayano XII I was fortunate to find available a pair of the discontinued XI. The XI is far superior as a stability shoe than the new revision. I've worn Kayano since the begining and have found that about every third or fourth version falls short of the characteristics that made this model famous. It is durable, stable and has a nice feel. Now, the XI can be found at significant discount. The XI is one of the best Asics has made and the XII is probably the worst. The XII is much lighter, but less of a stability shoe and certainly not durable and not made for a heavy runner. I hope that the XIII is more like the XI and less like the XII. You should stock up on the XI while they are still available."
290935,1,"I have very wide feet and was looking for some inexpensive dress shoes that I could wear not just to business meetings but walking a few blocks to the meeting, sometimes in the rain. I did not want to ruin a very good and expensive pair of shoes that way.These fit the bill nicely. They are wide and not uncomfortable (the leather is hard; not the glove-soft quality of expensive shoes, but then again at this price it's okay.)The sole and heel are rubber, but they are thin so the shoe does not like the thick-solded cheap shoes. Rubber soles can take the punding of walking on asphalt and cement without wearing out quickly like leather soles.And the shoe looks nice and dressy.For the price, this is a great shoe."
79042,0,"I just got these in the mail today, and I am unsure as to whether or not these shoes are legit. Although they came in a box, the shoes did not come with the ""Converse Chuck Taylor"" tags that usually come with the product. There are also some minor cosmetic issues (the stitching near the toe area of the shoes are uneven). Also, the label inside the tongue says that these shoes were made in Indonesia. The Converse that I used to wear were either made in China or Vietnam."
209269,1,"I have bought many (20+) pairs of Enzo Angiolini Liberty Loafers over the years in different colors and fabrics (leather and suede). They are great flats to wear to work or casually, and they fit true to size. A really good, solid, basic shoe. Shipping occurred within the advertised time frame."
91335,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
96857,1,"I love this shoe. It runs a little big so I had to order the next size smaller, but it came in the next week. This shoe goes with anything. It's my &#34;go to&#34; shoe. Love it."
108804,1,"I love these! Softspots knows how to make them comfortable right away. Yes, they come a little snug, but it gives them the ability to shape to your feet. Very attractive! Highly recommend!"
384697,1,"I absolutely love love love these flip flops! They are the most comfortable flip you will ever wear. Sometimes shoes need to be broken-in, but not these. They feel like you've had them for years. Watch out if you get these wet, because of the squishy yoga-mat, they do tend to take a while to dry out."
164090,0,Actual size was about a full size maybe even two sizes smaller than what they were labeled as. Had to return them. Pink glitter was all over the floor by just trying on one shoe so beware of glitter shedding
268303,0,"I LOVE THE SIZE, IT IS ROOMY. I JUST WISHED THAT THE OPENING FLAPS DOWN TO GIVE IT MORE ROOM TO PUT LARGE STUFF IN."
323725,1,I was desperately in need of a comfortable shoe that would also be dressy enough to wear with a suit. Well This is that shoe. It is incredibly comfortable (as most rockports tend to be) but it is also a very smart looking shoe. I got compliments on the first day I wore them in to work. Bravo Rockport for making my feet comfortable and stylish at the same time!
303908,1,Great looking western style leather slippers - beachy with a south-western flair. Comfortable. stylish and made to last a very very long time.
341429,1,"With narrow feet, very narrow heels, a 9-1/2 foot size (hard to find shoes for), very high arches, and no fat padding on the bottoms of my feet, these shoes fill the bill almost perfectly. I have a white pair for my daily dreadmill workout and a black pair to wear with jeans for all but the dressiest of occasions. I gave only four stars because the style is a little retro and dorky (I'm old, but I still wish I could wear cute shoes), the shoes could have a bit more arch support for me, and the heels don't hug as snugly as I would like, so I have to tie and retie the strings as tightly as I can. But, overall, the Princess gives me about the best fit and comfort I can expect now that long gone are the days when I could find narrow shoes in my size with arch support and extra-narrow heel width, along with enough sole cushioning to prevent a case of recurring plantar fasciitis (sp?), and it allows me to shop till I drop in reasonable comfort. I have a habit of buying two pairs of these at a time (especially when I find them at an outlet store), fearing that -- like so many products I like -- Princess will be discontinued. I only wish Reebok would make the same basic shoe with a little more pizazz -- maybe in a charcoal gray and/or tan, and with a little embellishment."
173005,1,"This Master's eel skin coin purse is larger than I expected and has a mauve ultra suede-type lining. It is as advertised and very high quality. It is so large, and nice, that I'm going to use it for carrying delicate jewelry in my overnight bag; earrings or rings fit in the inner snap-closing coin purse, and necklaces fit in the outer snap opening. Both gold-tone snaps are very secure.It perfectly matches the Master's eel skin card wallet that I bought from Amazon at the same time.If you have a burgundy EnV3 cell phone, it will be a perfect match for it too."
229754,1,The product was perfect. It got here in reasonable time. The shoes fit great and look great. I got exactly what I ordered.
307153,0,"Looked like they are well made, but unfortunately they run small and were not comfortable for him to wear. Returned shoes."
204561,1,"I had a pair of these shoes years ago that got lost on a vacation. I finally replaced them and I am so glad that I did. I love these shoes, they are comfortable and they hold up much better than a lot of the other flip flops I have purchased in the past. Every pair of Reef's that I have bought have been well worth the price."
178458,1,I was Larry Bird for halloween and what better way to complete the costume then with Green Chucks! They were fantastic!
179057,0,"The boot is very comfortable and light weight. It has been a good hiking boot providing good stability. I thought it would repel a little moisture, but it doesn't. If your foot gets wet be prepared for an immediate soaking of your sock."
148793,1,"I wear an 8 in some shoes and 7.5 in others. I ordered a half size smaller than that, a size 7 and they are a bit tight but am keeping them because I know they will stretch out some. Cute and comfy otherwise."
91556,0,"I order those cheap shoes for dancers a show in Montreal .Shoes are rather sharp ( old model 1995 ). The final cost (transport and customs,) double the price(prize). It is not a real sale.. And this old style finally cost me around 90.00 !! ( Independently of the shape, those shoes are comfortable."
15764,1,"I usually reserve myself to Doc Martens, but I was looking for a style change when I found these boots at an unreal price. They are lightweight and comfortable, and look very nice in solid black. The best thing about them is their durability. I am tough as hell on shoes in general, but these are very scuff resistant. I imagine these will still look good 6 months from now without any type of repair, but we'll see."
76684,1,"I've worn Deer Stag shoes for six years and have worn through about eight pair. These are very comfortable and wear very well and I am pretty hard on shoes. For a good utility shoe, this one works good and maintains its looks. I have worn out the soles more often than the top of the shoes. Over all, I will continue to buy this shoe until they stop making them."
20265,0,"They are not quiet like they say , not as confortable ... needs more padding"
2849,1,Its a nice shoe... it beats the shoes I had been wearing before. I got the wide version since my feet are a bit wide. I don't like how shoes get narrow at the tip. They need to make some wide toed hiking shoes.
118679,1,When ordering this shoe I knew that the sizing would be hit or miss...it happens when ordering online. My daughter wears a size 10.5 to 11 and I wanted to be sure that she would have a shoe that fits but I think I should have ordered closer to her street size.
308117,1,buy these shoes because they were very comfortable lei really are beautiful but sometimes I use are cute very pleased with this purchase.
174145,1,"First impressions (I have owned them for a month now).Good looking sporty look. Seem about 1/2 size smaller than expected.Have worn them in heavy snow and 15-30F temperatures.Have NOT drawn any water - feet stayed dry the whole time.These boots ARE NOT insulated - after roughly 15 minutes in 20F my feet were very cold - I am not saying this is a ""fault"" since I know these are not heavy winter boots - I just want people to be aware.I bought the darker ""mud"" color from sierratrading... might also order these ""stinger""."
256928,1,"Actually I'm the Dad of my college-age daughter who wanted these shoes, so I ordered them for her. But she loved them from the minute she tore open the package. They are lightweight but provide lots of support. She told me that several people have complimented her shoes, so that makes her like them even more. She had been looking at these shoes in shoe stores, so when she saw Amazon's great price then she told me and I ordered them."
131010,1,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light, stylish, and comfortable."
347682,1,"Awesome shoes! They're the classic lo top in a modern color. Fit great, feel great, and goes with most outfits."
332593,0,"Hard to find crocs (or any shoes) reasonably priced in my size (14).Fit is good, just not so comfortable with the knobby things on the inside of the top of shoe. I pretty much have to wear a lightweigh sock with them for comfort. Otherwise happy with them."
344101,1,"The purchase took place as expected in estimasdo time, and with respect to the product announcement being sold agrees with what is expected without any complications or problems arise"
289693,1,"These boots arrived before we expected them, and my son loved them. The were a replacement for a much more expensive brand, and he seemed to think they were equivalent. I had to contact the vendor to exchange for a different size, and they responded immediately and were quite helpful. You can't go wrong if you're looking for this kind of boot."
41369,0,"I just recieved this sneaker, unfortunately I must try to see if I can exchange it because the click closure is broken. :(I tried it on and I will have to tell you this shoe doesn't fit like a sneaker it fits like a dress shoe so order your dress shoe size which in my case is a WIDE which is not available. But I am still going to try to exchange it. It does have a cofortable sole and hope that it will ""break-in"". I had to let the straps all the way out to be able to fit it. I will have to sew the clip strap part because there isn't enough velcro for it to let out enough, that is if I can get a replacement. I paid so little for this shoe I'd be upset if I had to lose the ""deal"". If you have a very wide shoe size don't bother with this shoe."
173219,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
9251,1,"SALUDOS,LAS KEDS WOMEN'S CHAMPION BASIC OXFORD SNEAKER,SE LAS TRAJE PARA MI ESPOSA,Y QUEDO MUY COMPLACIDA Y AGRADECIDA,POR QUE LAS ZAPATILLAS RESULTARON SER MUY COMODAS Y A LA VEZ ELEGANTES,POR LO TANTO SE LAS RECOMIENDO,BYE."
121296,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
227826,1,"My cons were cheaper than getting them in the store and are my first pair. I love them they won't be my last. The people I ordered from through amazon sent me a shipping confirmation and on the confirmation it said it was a different shoe, but when I got them they were the ones I ordered from amazon so no harm done."
219597,1,NOTHING CAN EVER TAKE THE PLACE OF A TRIED & TRUE PAIR OF CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STARS. (WE CALLED THEM BO-BOS IN THE 70'S)
360623,1,"I had been trying everything before for to attack and improve my cellulite in my legs and button,and nothing worked at all lately.I take care of myself going to work out,being vegan and organic...and i felt in the way of depression when i wanted to wear a mini short or skirt that which i love those so much and I used to wear that when i was younger...Since the first moment I started to use finulite ,just couple days after I noticed the improvement results surround my knees.It was a miracle for me cause I was getting some info about some very expensive laser treatments that they couldn't to guarantee me about the results that I was looking for.So when I,ve done with my first finulite set,I started with the second one right away for complete the professional recommendation.It,s been few months ago that I finish with the cellulite treatment and my legs looks amazing.I highly recommend this product for real.From women to women."
195454,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
176111,2,The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width. they were way too tight. I gave them to a friend.
33299,1,"I have bought Easy Spirit shoes for years, so I knew the quality of this product. I was not disappointed. Shoes arrived in reasonable time, in perfect condition. Color and size as requested. Only wish I could get some other colors at this GREAT rate!"
250989,0,"I guess these boots have a little size variation, have had 3 pairs of 9.5, but this pair are a little too small.Of course I waited 2 days to long to check them:( Other than that awesome boots."
317637,1,"These shoes are accurately sized. Some say buy 1/2 bigger,but I need an extra large toe box ,and these were fine at my normal size(11 1/2). If you have a foot problem ,you can figure out what, exactly is wrong, because they are stripped of artificial supports. The cushioning is a little strange with extra build up on the inside edge,but it is removable ,if you want to replace it.Comfortable to wear all the time. See how your feet really work."
136627,1,I love my chuck Taylors. They go well with Jeans or almost anything that I want to wear. Looking to buy the Chocolate next.
106938,0,A bit stiff to start with but I needed the support for rough terrain on my winter walks. Otherwise the support is where I need it and is comfortable for my toes.
53495,1,"LOVE these. Got them in grey with yellow laces- LOVE this color combo. They are true to size, comfy with or without socks (thin socks), and clean very easy. I use oxyclean spray and/or put them in the washer and they come out squeaky clean. So glad I got these!"
40407,1,"I went on a trip last June to DC, NYC, and Philly ...it was swelteringly hot and humid ..the other so-called ""walking"" shoes I bought were useless! ..big brand name expensive things . gave me blisters. .I wore these flip flops for hours and hours and hours . . while walking around all three cities. . .and . they still appear to be in great shape! ..I'm looking to buy a few more pairs ..I've never been this rhapsodic about a pair of shoes .but ..when you are traveling . .and have sore feet ..nothing is worse . ..these rock!"
53450,1,a lot longer than i thought they would be. but a nine would be to small. but they are nice. just wish they weren't so long.
382600,0,"This shoe looks great and is very comfy, but it runs small. Order one size up if you can. I wear a size 11M, the largest size available, so the shoe did not fit me well. Too bad they don't go up to a size 12, because I would have definitely exchanged them for the bigger size."
187836,1,"I got them for my slippers, and now use them in my boots, too. VERY thick (might be too thick for some boots), and VERY warm!"
298464,1,"These shoes are really cute and mostly comfortable. A little rough place near one toe rubbed for a while, but isn't a problem now. The sole seems narrower than the shoe itself, so it presesnts a lean profile. I walk in these for fitness, and the vents provide good circulation, but there's lots of plastic in the top, so some folks might find them hot to wear. The fit is true to size. I have liked other Skechers better than these, but still will buy Skechers."
293741,1,"I found a cute, funky, casual, black shoe in Mia's Addison sandal. It took a few wears to have the thong between the toe ease up and feel comfortable. The ""toe ring"" adds a secureness. The silver accents adds a mysterious look. I've worn the shoe numerous times......most recently in NYC where I walked a great deal and had no ill effects. They look great with shorts, capris, and the peasant type skirts. I'm happy with the shoe and the best part was the great price."
249661,1,"My husband has two pairs of these shoes in different colors and he practically lives in them. They are by far his favorite shoes, next to his tennis shoes. He is on his feet all day at work so a comfortable shoe is manditory - but he needs to look great too! This shoe is the perfect blend. They look like a typical dress shoe (not as stiff) but with a rubber sole (vs. the normal leather sole) for added comfort. He has worn them for several years with the sole wearing out somewhere between 18 months and 2 years. Even then the shoe itself still looks great. We found them on sale through amazon and stocked up on two new pair, as they can be pricey at retail stores."
248772,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
157077,0,These sneakers are incredibly cute but also very uncomfortable! They are as flat inside as can be with minimal cushion. I was disappointed in the lack of insole and arch support.
176303,1,i love it!!!i ve bought these same boots before and i will continue to buy them until my feet dont move anymore
718,1,This is my best shoe purchase in a long time. Sporty look. Comfortable. Perfect fit. I wear them every chance I get.
162919,1,I bought these slippers since I have a few pairs of Ugg boot. I absolutely love them!! I would recommend that you buy a size larger in the slipper than in the boots.
36989,1,"I wear a 10 and it is hard to find shoes and sneakers that fit. I ordered a 10W (wide) and they fit perfectly. They fit so well that I feel they were made especially for me.The canvas is great and seems very durable. They are very comfortable and easy to walk in, especially compared to my old clunky sneakers. I will buy KEDS from now on.I also bought the same shoe in white leather (10W) and that sneaker runs a little larger. I can slip into the white leather sneakers if I'm not wearing socks, but I cannot do that with the black canvas one.NOTE: The picture shown is WRONG. The eyelets that the laces go through are not a brass color, They are black. I was very happy with the black and I think I like them more than the brass."
207305,1,"Great product and service that is fairly priced, arrived promptly and exactly as ordered. A+++"
186899,1,"I love these sneakers. I wear them walking every day and so far they haven't broken down. I don't know if they will last a 1,000 miles or not though. If they will just last 6 months, I will be happy! They are really comfortable and have good toe room but do order wide size if you need the extra width. I ordered some New Balance sneakers at same time I ordered these and they were double the price but I like these much better and the New Balance which were also ordered in wide was just a little too tight in toes. These feel good and you feel like you are just bouncing right along. I wish the straps were just a tad longer but I wouldn't change them for strings though. A really nice pair of shoes and I'm getting ready to order another pair for spares!"
271166,1,"Haven't owned a pair since high school, but can't deny how sturdy they are, and how comfortable the soles are"
219871,1,I bought it for my wife and she love them.... they even come with extra red laces... Everythin arrived on time and in perfect condition...Thanks
261993,0,"Light weight and soft but, the size 7 was more like a size 8. Not as good as the wanted brand ( same style, material)."
259919,1,"I love chucks!!! what more can I say, super comfortable and clean.Cant weight to break em in and wait till they look old"
310246,1,product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
174661,1,"I recently got turned on to Clarks shoes and this is my second pair of Clarks. I am extremely happy with these shoes. I wore them to work and they were comfortable the entire day!! They are also very cute, stylish and versatile. You can were them with slacks, jeans and skirts. My mom tried them on (she's not into shoes at all) and was surprised by the comfort. She said,""wow, these are comfortable;you can't tell you're wearing heels!"""
167372,1,"I was looking for some comfortable slip on shoes and found this from Easy Spirit. They are great!Very comfortable, light weight and come in so many colors. I got the navy blue but I may get another pair this spring. They are great for walking. Thanks"
292486,0,"I bought these for my 2 year old little boy. The boots look great and are well made but they are REALLY difficult to get on,even with the laces completely removed. After about a dozen wearings they break in and start to go on easier, but if you are buying these for a baby or toddler, be prepared to spend an extra ten minutes putting these on your little guy for the first few weeks!"
228378,1,"These shoes are true to size, are authentic converse, are comfortable, and arrived on time and in the correct color. My only complaint about converse is that they are a bit too narrow. However you can find them at pretty much any shoe store so you can always try them on first before you buy them. I am happy about the price too (they were $10 more expensive at DSW than here on amazon). They don't offer much in terms of arch support, but overall I can't complain."
371791,1,I liked the fit after sending the size 13's back for a 14. I have worn 13's in everything for years and never been in a size 14. Once I got the right size the boots fit well and look very nice. We will see how they hold up.
303504,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S.

353103,1,"I wear these boots 365 days a year, in wet, cold conditions, and they never fail to keep my feet comfortable, protected and well supported"
204502,1,A very nice shoe & great looking. I had to return it because it wasn't narrow enough but it looked great on me & I was tempted to keep it.
171812,1,"It's so suitable for the old.I bought it for my grandmother.it very comfortable,it's very very soft,and suit for feet!the old like it very much."
61332,1,"I've tried many types of boots in my day. By profession I am a miner and work six days a week. I have never found a boot that I can take out of the box and take off to work in. The hi-Tec boot that I bought I allowed three weeks to break in. When I would get home, till I went to bed, even going to the store, you name it. I also gave them a good dose of mink oil often. I have seen many reveiws about how stiff the leather is and sole issues. If your boot has no wrinkles in the stress points it's not broke in and will be uncomfortable. My first hike was five hours at twenty five degrees steep, unstable rock and leaf covered slopes and my boots worked as I would have expected. The soles stayed soft enough to grip the rocks and provided good ankle support. I have always worn Red Wing boots at the mine site but won't any more as they have changed the soles to a hard rubber that won't grip and I hate them. The soles look like new after two years(over two hundred dollar boots). I'm breaking in my Hi-Tec for the Grand Teton range and I'm sure that I have made the right choice. If you do buy a pair of Hi-Tec boots make sure you BREAK THEM IN before you judge them. As for me, my ""Altitude IV"" won't be my last, I love them."
92402,1,"Cool shoes, i lke it so much. But size of shoes is less on half than mine real."
294796,1,This product got to me quick. The boots are great. Really pleased with the price. I will have the boots for the rest of my life. Thanks
245793,1,"I have purchaced this item and it is great! Excellent price and great, quality. Very comfortable to wear an I love it. I can recommend it to anyone who is seeking comfortable boots for cheap price!"
213160,1,"Best sandal I have ever purchased! I have every color, but still keep on buying them, mostly in black. Always want to have a pair or 2 that looks brand new. Thay are SO comfortable, especially if you have foot or leg problems. I am 63 and have been buying these for at least the last 8 years. I do have foot problems and sometimes they are the only shoe that I can wear. I am in love with these sandals. The metallic ones are good if you want something a little dressy. Again, so comfortable, well made and they last a long time!"
72009,1,"I ordered these boots two days before Halloween and when I got them I was really happy with them! Great, sexy, and fun boots!"
30280,1,Comfy and great quality. These are also a bit more &#34;manly&#34; so perfect for a gift to my husband. Best to go one size more than your regular size.
295897,1,"After the first freezing rain this winter, it took me forever to walk on the parking lot and sidewalks to work. That night, I ordered Yaktrax. They arrived quickly, and the next week, more ice! What a difference! I could walk across the pavement with no fear of falling. Take them off before walking on shiny indoor floors, though."
248400,1,"just love these boots. needed a plain black pair.. didnt want a heavy boot or a ridiculous price. so of course i went to Amazon and looked for timberland boots. my favorite place to shop and my favorite boot manufacturer. got a great price- fast delivery and a pair of boots in perfect condition. very happy with this purchase. i am a womens size 7= a 5.5 big kid in almost all timberlands. this is the only place that gives me the 3 things i need when buying tims, size,variety of design and prices i love! best part is i can shop in my pajamas :)"
271252,0,This shoe is bigger than any other size 9 I own... by at least a full size.
332926,1,"I usually only Birkenstocks, but I gave these a try because they are so cute, and they are great! They came in handy when it was pouring down rain, no need to ruin shoes here!"
301604,2,"those are a good shoes, but the delivery provide service is the worst, i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21 4 days more than usually delivery day, i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail, bad deal to me!"
150488,1,"I've worn these VANELi dress flats for years and have them in several colors...and highly recommend them for both comfort and quality. They are expensive, so I always wait for sales. However, the last few times I've ordered these shoes on sale from this store on Amazon, the shoes have felt like they are at least a half a size too small. Sadly, I've had to return them."
320675,1,"It's a great ballet shoe, nice leather and sole piece--seem well made. Unfortunately I thought street shoe size would work for this also. It didn't. I had to send it back and get another size up. You might want to get a size larger too..but great for the price!"
112584,1,"My son was thrilled to find these Tims at this unbelievably low price. Amazon shipping was prompt as always, and the fit was perfect."
295499,1,"The Yaktrax Walkers are the BEST! I was slipping and falling on our ice and snow-covered sidewalks for months trying to walk my dog, but when I got the Yaktrax I wore them every day and I haven't slipped yet. They really help to make it possible to go outside for a brisk walk in any kind of weather!"
204548,1,"These reefs came in on time and were just as comfortable as I remember them. I haven't bought a new pair in maybe 4 years. I recommend these. Reliable, really comfortable, and they look nice."
241789,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
29167,1,The product arrived on time and in excellent condition. No complaints or concerns. The leather is a little tight at first but it stretches with time. The size is true.
187336,1,"If you're looking for comfortable boots to wear in any weather, Uggs Classic Tall are perfect!!!! I loved them from the moment I slipped my feet into them. I can wear them anywhere, any time of year. My feet don't sweat or get too warm in summer, and they definitely stay warm and dry in winter. I LOVE THESE BOOTS!"
247338,1,"This is a nice shoe, though I was hoping it would be more walking friendly. No apparent problems thus far."
29135,0,"Received quickly and was well packaged....I do love Minnetonka brand. Now let me say it is a lovely shoe as far as looks. The length seemed fine but runs a little small as far as the width for me. Call me frugal/cheap but I don't like the idea of paying over $15 for a house slipper - well not for myself anyway. The bottom/sole is made of suede - in fact it is one continuous piece with the top and back securely sewn, (to myself I say it is a moccasin - duh). Why I thought I could wear them outdoors is beyond me - guess I should have paid more attention to the words ""Soft Sole."" I returned them."
199733,0,"I only wear ASICS shoes because I've tried every other shoe, and these are the best brand in my opinion. I run, on average, 10 miles per week. So far the shoes are fine, but they're nothing special. Typically I spend $85-$100 minimum on running shoes, and these I bought on sale for $60. My feet don't feel the kind of support that I usually get from brand new ASICS. Next time I'll bite the bullet and spend the $100+."
146778,1,"As all ugg classic boots, they are the most comfy and soo warm. I wear them with no socks wonderfull for cold weather inside home or outside."
85161,1,I've had these shoes for about 3 weeks now and took them with me to FL. I had them soaked and full of sand and they still look and smell new. No odor. The reason I mention odor is that I have used Merrill's and Lands End sandals in the past and both have had awful foot odor after about a few weeks. It traps moisture in the cushion of the shoe and gets worse. These have a hard rubber sole and I don't think they will ever trap moisture. So far so good!
360671,1,I buy tennis shoes on line all the time and they run true to size. I wear a 5 1/2 and have trouble finding certain shoes. When I read reviews that these shoes run small I ordered 1 size up and they fit just fine. The box said 61$'s and many in my class bought from a local shoe store for that price. So this is a very good deal. I'm an senior and love to TAP now!
21761,1,Enzo most comfortable shoes. Have been wearing them for years. I highly recommend them to all who want a comfortable shoe.
361434,1,"Super comfortable even for problem feet. Great casual sandal that can be worn anywhere, anytime. Wish they had more colors available in my size."
353174,1,"These shoes are just so cute! I have recieved numerous compliments and plenty of stares cause of these shoes. At first I wasn't too sure about the heel but because it is a wedge, they don't feel as high as they look.I love the vintage look and how I can wear them with a dress or jeans.Also as always....Amazon delivers fast."
15181,1,I purchased these boots in september for the hunting season. I have recently purchased another pair for my father I liked them so much.
189684,1,"These shoes are fabulous well constructed and they look so cute on my little girl's tiny feet I love them, they are even cheaper here than in the stride rite site"
371686,1,"my third pair of this exact model and make. Excellent quality, consistent through the years and best price/value ratio I have found in a long time."
374071,1,"Since I have a wide foot and have not been able to find another brand that carries 4E's, I am very happy to have a company that provides for what I need!"
219888,1,The color is amazing! If you wear any Brown Tees this is the must have shoe!
111954,2,"You need to order 1-2 sizes smaller than your normal size, these things are massive boats. It doesn't matter if you have other Puma shoes in size X, go size X-1 here. Pretty mad that I wasted $40 on shoes I can't wear now, but that's what happens when you buy Amazon."
120688,1,After wearing 574 for a few years I decided to try the another retro show the 420. While the show is nice looking and flexible. There is very little padding compared to the 574s I have had. I will wear the shoes till they wear out but will go back to 574s for my next shoe.
314640,1,"Great shoe. They arrived two days after I ordered them. I've bought 5 pairs this summer on Amazon and 1 pair in a local Mall, but I ended up paying to much for them. These new sandal's fit perfect. Never any break in period. They come in wide widths too! That's always a bonus for me. Get to know your European size, one pair that I bought on Amazon, through one of their sponsored shops had European sizing. These sandals are Midnight Blue, the color in the add is true, and go with almost everything, from jeans to skirts and dresses. Dress them up or down. And I know that Amazon backs up all of their products! Go ahead, give in to your temptation, you will not regret it!!"
162731,1,"RYKA shoes are simply the best. I am a very active aerobicsinstructor and hiker. No one makes better shoes than RYKA, period."
20946,1,"Finding these shoes on Amazon were like winning the grand prize in a raffle.My mother is 91 yrs. old and sent me on a ride visiting Easy Spirit stores totry and locate these shoes in this particular color to replace an older pair.I did not find these in any store. I decided to check Amazon and was nicelysurprised to find them. She is so happy and they are comfortable.Best part is making your mother happy, thank you Amazon."
285063,1,"It's been a little over a year since I purchased a pair of these shoes in the brown color option in my usual size. I don't wear them on a regular basis--I am generally in skirts and dressier shoes if I am out of the house--but when I travel they are excellent to wear, and they are also fine for trips to the supermarket in colder weather. I wore these shoes almost non-stop when I visited my parents recently and stayed for a few days; they were great for walking around town and window shopping as well as traipsing across fields in the mountains. My left shoe gives me some pain across the top of my foot, I am unsure as to why this is the case, but I laced my shoes up in a 'hackey-sack' configuration so there is less pressure there, and the left shoe is almost comfortable now. During longer treks I still feel some discomfort but I do not blame that on either the shoe or my foot, they just probably are not the best match for each other. But my right foot feels perfectly fine in its Eastland shoe, nice and snug and solid. My grandmother, when she saw me during my trip, asked me if I've grown (I'm in my thirties so that is highly unlikely!), and I said it was the shoes! From looking at them casually on someone's feet you would probably would not notice the height in the sole and heel, as it is not obtrusive, but it is there."
200301,1,"Growing up, we always wore topsiders, and it's great to know that Sperry continues to make them with the quality that they did way back when. My new pair is a beautiful color (Amaretto) and look even better than the photo. Highly recommend this shoe."
23117,1,"These shoes are comfortable and funky! They look great with jeans. I got so many compliments when I wore them. They are not the greatest walking shoes, but who cares! I ordered an 8 1/2 and they fit perfect. I have a wide foot so I was a little nervous that they wouldn't fit, but they fit beautifully. I can't wait for spring to wear them with capris."
202447,1,"The slippers are the 2nd pair I have purchased. They are very soft and well cushioned. The only draw back is that the cushioning goes flat after wearing them several times, but they still are better than any slippers I have purchased before."
183712,1,"These shoes are incredibly light and wearing them after wearing construction shoes all day, make you want to run ! The material does not seem very strong but I guess all light weight shoes are like that. The sizing is a little screwed up. Size 10 is really size 9.5. So buy 0.5 sizes up. But You can still fit into ""your"" size and the shoes easily expand.The only annoying thing I found is that the footprint is so small that it feels like your feet are touching the ground at an angle. Maybe this is the right way to be running .. I dont know. I have run about 10 miles with these shoes so far and they seem to be adjusting ... so maybe after a few more weeks, I will get better used to having my feet touch the ground with these shoes. I am just used to shoes that touch the ground flat and your feet inside the shoes cannot rock them back and forth sideways ... but I guess a shoe this light and contoured does allow extreme flexibility and I am just not used to that.And note that while they provide very good grip on all sorts of wet and gainy pavement, they dont provide very much support at all so I can see a lot of potential ankle twists if you run with them ""out back"" like the name suggests. The small foot print I think will easily let your foot pivot in unnatural ways on loose soil.On tar and concrete though, they are excellent. An excellent and light running shoe. Just the sizing is screwed up and has a very bounded footprint."
355410,1,"My daughter loved the shoes. They are good quality and reasonable price. The vendor sent the shoes on time. My daughter says they are ""very cool"""
17427,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
13923,1,Perfect. Great quality. Your feet will get hot if you where them for an extended time period. I had a pair of lands end for six plus years. These seem twice as good as those.
120980,0,"I mistakenly ordered the wrong width, have reordered it but havn't recieved it yet, I hope it fits as it is a nice well made thong."
248833,1,I have a 3 year old who is hard on shoes. These are good inexpensive boots that last a while . Its definitely worth the money
159374,1,I was Larry Bird for halloween and what better way to complete the costume then with Green Chucks! They were fantastic!
187491,0,"I love UGG boots...this pair is my second. However, I am not happy with EastBay, the shipper. They shipped me the wrong product and then took three and a half weeks to send me the right product. I had to continuously email them about the status of the shipment...very annoying. I love the boots though...so soft and comfortable."
152054,1,"My feet have hurt most of my life. When I slipped these on, I was in heaven. I wore them to work and after 8 hours, my feet still feel wonderful. I'm going to order several more in different colors. What a relief!!"
307218,1,My son and I both wear the Keen Newports- outstanding sandal- highly recommended! The olive/deep lichen is an excellent neutral color and the on sale price made it a great deal!
15377,1,Picked up these shoes for the wife (whom is VERY picky) and she absolutely loved them. Great affordable price and kickback in return from the lil' woman! It pays to pricegrab.
307457,1,"...boots as Clarks always are. However, I was very disappointed in how wide they were at the top. This measurement is often given but not always correctly. These are much wider than I expected and I am bummed about it."
84011,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
325296,1,"This shoe is a fun and flirty way to go out to the club or just for halloween, either way they are awesome."
193577,0,"Bought these for a white school uniform shoe. It is narrow at the ball of the foot, completely straight where your foot would be widest. Might want to consider a wide width or one size larger, even if you don't normally need wide. Seems to hold up well to wear. Leather in good condition."
287123,1,Comfortable and good shock resistance. Waterproof. Not the prettiest shoe in the market but very functional and a sensational price!
292951,1,"The sneakers arrived in a timely fashion, as promised. They were exactly what my son wanted. They were priced reasonably.They were of high quality and true to size. Thank you, Amazon"
84653,1,"Elegant leather work shoe. The stitching is superb, the tread is durable and grippy, and the sole is comfortable. Online sizing fit perfectly. Not much more that I can ask for at $60."
288946,1,Before I had a lumbar laminectomy in 2003 I volunteered to teat a pair of Rockport ProWalkers. Since my apinal surgery every shoe that I had resulted in my right sole slapping down on the pavement. Recently I took my Rockport ProWalkers out of the closet and to my wonder walking with them did not result in foot drop. There must be something in the design or construction of the sole of the shoe that prevents my foot from slapping down on the pavement. Most of the labeling identification has worn off the shoes so I can't find a model number. I would like to replace my old Rockport ProWalkers with a newer shoe if I can locate the model number.
108725,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
201279,1,"These are very stylish, while still staying casual. My fiance loves them. Pair them with jeans, or with some great pants, and they look really nice. They go well with the newer style of the straight legged pants for men - the slightly flared older pants he has don't look as good with them."
162786,2,Problem with this shoe is that they don't carry my size 8.5 double E. So why is that I am having a problem finding my size. Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department. To me there is no excuse of not carring my size.
256174,1,"I have these shoes in black, beige and white and love 'em. Each year I order new ones....they wash great in washing machine."
122793,1,These feel fine on. They are well padded on the sides could use more on the bottoms though!Nice looking shoe But...Shapeups by Skechers are truely the way to go!
351472,1,They were really nice sandals but they ran too small. I had to return them. The company is a very pleasant company to work with. I recommend purchasing from them in the future.
35681,1,"The shoes are cute and worth the purchase. I have some positives and negatvies with these shoes.Positives:1) The shipping came in within the estimated time.2) The shoe looks exactly as pictured. They are really cute.3) The design of the shoe makes the foot appear smaller.4) Shoe is great for people that have wide feet.Negatives:1) Although the bedding of the shoe is soft and cushioned, the strap/buckle that goes across the toes hurts! The plastic is too hard against the toes and digs in every time you take a step. It pinches the toes. Hopefully I will wear these shoes in so the plastic won't hurt anymore. I think Dr. Scholls should have kept in mind comfort when making the strap that goes over the feet as well (not just the bedding of the shoe).2) Shoe runs a bit small. I had to order half a size up to get the right fit. I usually wear a 8-8.5 but had to order a 9 because that is all they had left."
155929,2,The shoes didn't fit. They were nice shoes but my husband has a wide hard to fit foot. Sorry we didn't try again.
344088,1,"Im not a big fan of sneakers, but these shoes I now want in every color. They are so comfortable and a must have to every college student. Love them!"
180527,1,I'm a huge sneaker freak and have to say these shoes are some of my favorites. Comfortable and stylish they look great with my 511 skinny leg jeans. I will always keep a pair of these in my collection.
53759,1,"The brand ""Keds"" speaks for itself. But I got it at a great price and came in just a few days. Like the fact they come in different widths."
100150,1,"These shoes arrived so quickly - 6 days earlier than promised! They fit perfectly - I am a 7.5 and they are true to size. Too cute for words, and comfortable too!"
32894,1,"These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. They are great to wear to work and great to walk in. I am buying more shoes from Grasshoppers, forget Rockport and Easy Spirit."
192367,1,These are the only sandals I wear. Have been ordering these for more than seven years....why buy anything else?
203975,1,"I ordered these because they were the cheapest pair online. They are very comfortable and the fit is great. I usually wear a size 9.5 or 10, but I ordered a 9 for a nice snug fit. The plastic has molded to my flat feet making it incredibly easy to work in these. I usually wear 5 3/4 or 6 inch heels, so 7 inches is very high for me but they are surprisingly easy to play around in. I will definitely order this brand/from this seller again."
160553,1,"Awesome!! Around for years, with no reason to change!!"
290743,1,This is an excellent walking shoe. They were comfortable right from the start. I would buy them again and have before.
299427,1,Product is so much more comfortable and well constructed compared to knock offs. Glad I bought 'em!
172138,1,"Probably the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. This is coming from someone on his feet all day. These shoes are sturdy, comfortable and well priced."
158351,1,"Thank Heavens for those dear sweet chaps at Converse who years and years ago crafted this high-performance, foot-contouring, ankle hugging canvas shoe. Also available in the more contemporary leather versions, Converse All-Star Chuck Taylors' are the most brilliant shoes known to (wo)man...I'm on stage a lot, so jumping around in these baby's is a cinche - and when considering other stylish options (heels, clogs, cross trainers without the well needed ventalation that my feet so honestly deserve?), I'm afraid that no one even seems to come close to Chuck's humble design. I own a low cut pair in Orange Popsicle, two high cut pairs in Pink and Black and am in the processes of purchasing a pair of black leather boot-cut chuck taylors...honestly, not any other shoes could provide as much daily wear and tear as these Chuck Taylors!! And, as an added bonus, they can be worn casually or dressed up with some tailored pants or flashy jeans for a night-time look...I cannot emphasise enough my dedication to these shoes - buy a pair, people, these old faithful's will not let you down. I LOVE UNISEX SHOES!"
296504,1,"Having just had achilles tendon surgery I was looking for a comfortable slipper that didn't feel like it was ""flat"" when I wore it. The memory foam in these is very nice and gives you a cushioned feeling.My only problem with these slippers is about 1 1/2 months after buying them, the plastic sole on one of them split open right across the side. So now all the inner parts are falling out of one of my slippers.I am going to try another pair of these because I found them the most comfortable of all the slippers I've tried, and hope that my experience with the cracking plastic sole was only an isolated problem."
149504,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
345520,1,"After wearing the high tops for basketball, I wanted a pair of the low tops that I could wear in the summer with shorts without looking like a complete idiot. These are possibly my favorite shoes (bearing in mind, I'm a guy). They're comfortable, and since they're made of canvas, my feet don't get hot while wearing them. I haven't had a problem with them getting cold either. I'd say the biggest plus over the high tops is the ease in which I'm able to put them on. You dont have to unlace half the shoe to be able to put your foot in it. The only disappointment I have is that the shoes aren't any less expensive on amazon as they are in retailers around my area."
35318,1,"these were a replacement of similar shoes that i had before, but the dog ate them. (guess he liked them too!) great shoes at a great price! thanks amazon!"
151623,1,Being in the military we run ALOT.As you can imagine I've been through alot of running shoes.These are by far the most comfortable I've ever had.
58130,1,"I wear a 10 and it is hard to find shoes and sneakers that fit. I ordered a 10W (wide) and they fit perfectly. They fit so well that I feel they were made especially for me.The canvas is great and seems very durable. They are very comfortable and easy to walk in, especially compared to my old clunky sneakers. I will buy KEDS from now on.I also bought the same shoe in white leather (10W) and that sneaker runs a little larger. I can slip into the white leather sneakers if I'm not wearing socks, but I cannot do that with the black canvas one.NOTE: The picture shown is WRONG. The eyelets that the laces go through are not a brass color, They are black. I was very happy with the black and I think I like them more than the brass."
80379,1,This shoe is exactly what my son wanted. The quality much better than cheaper versions. This is the real converse shoe
256592,1,"Reebok its that I want. You can wear those everywhere during the day. But they run small maybe for a number. I use to wear 9, but they didn't feet in my feet. so Think about this if you are going to buy these shoes."
256065,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn-so much so that I have ordered several pairs. I did find that I need a narrower shoe if I plan to wear them barefoot-the width I usually wear in Easy Spirit is too loose without socks.
65242,1,Have been wearing Keds for years. Had to go to a larger size because I need thicker insoles. They're great!
37264,1,"Danners Mountain Light II is a hiking boot with a very long heritage, going back to 1957. Before then, hikers pretty much used work boots or very expensive European mountain climbing boots.The Mountain Light II is constructed using what is often called the ""stitchdown"" method, otherwise known as Norwegian Welt. The upper leather flares out where it meets the midsole and the two parts are joined by stitching which is visible around the outside edge of the boot. This method has a couple of advantages: it makes the sole of the boot slightly wider than the uppers, which gives a broad base for stability. When the sole eventually wears out, it is easily replaced. Disadvantages are that boots constructed this way can be heavier than boots in which the soles are cemented on.Uppers are constructed of one piece of leather, with a vertical seam at the Achilles tendon, covered by a reinforcing heel counter. The tongue is interesting in that it is covered by a leather debris guard which opens toward the outer side of the boot, and which serves to close the space between the tongue and the uppers.Laces run through five impressively strong sets of D-rings, then around two speed hooks. All the hardware appears intended to last forever, in other words to outlast the soles and leather and then be reinstalled on a new pair of boots several decades from now.Soles are dual-density Vibram ""Kletterlift"", with a very firm outsole for traction, and a slightly cushier middle layer to absorb some shock when walking.The entire inside of the boot is lined with a Gore-Tex fabric, and so is waterproof until the water depth exceeds the level of the tongue gussets. The boot is about 5 inches high, so provides good freedom of motion when walking, while still covering and protecting the ankle bones. For some people, this translates as ""does not provide good ankle support"" and prefer a boot with more height. I feel that not having a tight fit around the ankle allows the muscles and tendons to work more smoothly.Walking in these boots after wearing foam padded ""sneaker boots"" can be puzzling at first. Danners start out feeling very narrow and stiff, as if there is no flexibility at all. Additonally, there is no foam padding anywhere, just Gore-Tex in contact with your feet, surrounded by leather, with a very slight give in the footboard. The debris guard over the tongue feels very thick and pushes down on your instep. I really don't know how anyone ever liked these enough in the store to buy them and take them home, unless like me, they had read favorable reviews from previous owners and gave them a chance.As one wears the boot for short walks, an interesting thing is observed to occur. The soles begin to flex where they need to under the ball of your foot. The footboard gradually conforms to the contours of the bottom of your foot. The leather over the instep, around the heel and the toes slowly begins to flex and stretch until it fits your foot like the boots were custom fitted for you. After a few weeks, you reach a point where the boot is ON your foot, but doesn't call attention to itself because the fit has become so good. Any perspiration from your feet is very efficiently wicked away from your socks by the Gore-Tex lining, so feet stay dry and comfortable.With each pair of boots, Danner provides their well-known ""Airthotic"" insert, a flexible ventilated plastic heel and arch support, which allows the user to fine-tune the desired degree of arch support. I experimented with and without the Airthotic, and with various thicknesses of socks, finally settling on no insert and two pairs of medium-weight hiking socks. This combination gives a good fit with a lot of cushion surrounding the foot, as well as exposing the full surface of the Gore-Tex liner for moisture absorbtion.In sum, the Danner Mountain Light II is a classic design with excellent workmanship, updated with some modern materials to make them waterproof, and therefore providing a good climate for the wearers feet under a wider range of conditions.Although not particularly comfortable initially, they soon achieve a very high degree of comfort, surpassing in some ways the comfort of many other boots. I don't wear mine at work, because I have to wear steel toe boots. However, when I get home, I very often put them on to wear around the house. The fit is so good, I enjoy wearing them while eating supper or watching television. I also wear them casually, with jeans and khakis, sometimes even to church.Durability appears to be very good, many users report years of wear before resoling, with multiple resolings possible if the leather is cared for properly,Their appearance is enough unlike other hiking boots that people notice them, and offer spontaneous compliments.I found these to run about 1/2 size smaller than most of my other shoes and boots."
17104,1,"I thought my ASICS GT 2100 were the best and most comfortable running shoe I have ever worn; but that changed once I received my GT 2110, these shoe's have the comfort and stability that basically shapes to your foot and the added cushion inside does not cause your foot to feel cramped. Very comfortable and lightweight."
293157,1,These shoes get noticed due to the color combination. This grandmother loves it. The fit is perfect and the comfort rates high on the scale.
197772,1,Love the product...the style is classic what more can I say. The only thing that I need to remember is that they run a half a size too large. But other then that...wonderful product!
374605,1,"Bought mine last weekend at GandLClothing in Des Moines, Iowa. Excellent close out price of 97.00 bucks. My 1st pair of Chippewa Boots and was amazed from when I 1st put them on in the store. I normally wear 11 1/2 and found those too large. 11 was just right with room to move around including a thick sock.I can tell there will be a little break-in needed around upper tounge.Solid boot!"
3703,1,"I have bought about 20 pair of these boots over the past 6 or 7 years. I usually buy them 2 pair at a time and wear one for work and one for good.Even when you buy them at the buy one get one half price in stores the price on here is by far cheaper than anywhere else.They are comfortable, waterproof, last a long time and are light weight."
19568,1,"I have been a purchaser of Cole Haan shoes for a long time. I've always believed good footwear is very important if you're on your feet all day. I have friends who buy cheap shoes and always complain how their feet hurt. I am extremely tough on footwear because of my size. I'm 6'5"", weigh 215 lbs and have a very high arch in my foot. I like all leather shoes because they will last a long time with proper care and they can be resoled. Cole Haan shoes are always true to size and this style can be worn with Dockers, dress slacks, a suit and jeans. I'm giving them 4 stars only because they took much longer to break in than other Cole Haan shoes I've owned. Once they loosened up, they are extremely comfortable and look good all the time."
67151,1,"This is my third pair. I tend to wer loafers out pretty fast (Shoeswithin 6 months typically) but these last over two years. They are well made. I switched to these when Rockport stopped selling the style I liked. They were great too, but these last longer than Rockports. Price was great too. I am willing to pay for a good product, and these are good product."
293504,1,I don't have good luck with this brand. I bought Propet walking shoes that I had to return because they were too small. I like the looks of these sandals and I read the reviews that said they run large so I thought they might fit me. I ordered my usual size and they were too small. My toes were right at the end. I returned those and ordered the next size up. This time the length was just right but the shoes are wider! Even with the velcro adjustment I can't get them comfortably snug. This is just me. They are nice sandals and I really wish they fit me. If Propet shoes fit you then you'll like these sandals.

370932,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
108125,1,I bought these shoes for my Mother and she absolutely loves them. She's 91 and wears them all day long and tells me that her feet don't get tired. So i think these shoes are great because my Mother is very hard to please that easily!
213341,1,"I had been looking for navy sandals in my hard to find size for about a year. Finally found them, but decided canvas close toe shoes looked better with skirts. Service was good."
103726,0,"Great working machine, when I let friends use it. Shoe polishing is a skill I lack, I was thinking this product would make it easier for me. But it doesn't, please only buy this product if you can already polish shoes. There are no shortcut with this product."
333615,1,Lasts about 6 months with daily 4-mile walks on pavement. Lasts about a year in the gym with exercise equipment. I get good angle support and good arch support. Washes well.
271651,1,"I bougth it for my 23 years old son, he told me they are great and they are so comftable."
149848,1,The Reebok Classic shoe is wonderfully designed and well made. I prefer the black/white version but all the color schemes work nicely with the design. I highly recommend this item as a walking or all purpose shoe.
213177,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
232614,1,"These shoes are very warm and comfortable. I wear a 6.5 but ordered them in 7 and they fit great like this. I love how easy is to take them on and off. Not stylish shoes, but they are kind of cute and very good for a college student like me that has to walk around a lot in cold winter."
296967,1,"It looks nice. It feels comfortable. I have had it for a month now, and I like it. I can't say about it's durability. I did get 1 size larger than my regular size because of the limited choices.Other than that, for 20 bucks, it's a deal."
164954,1,I ummm actually haven't worn these shoes yet but. They get props from me just cause they look good. And they is original. so poo poo to you.
126303,1,"Can't go wrong with the New Balance M574. These look awesome. True to size, well made, just a great shoe!!!"
173455,1,"have been wearing this style of sandle for years, don't know what i would do without them. and i am a shoe person!"
224061,1,"a great shoe, buy a size below what you usually wear. comfy, durable and a great casual look with jeans."
293573,1,I love this shoe. I want one pair in every color!
93944,1,"I just love these sneakers. I walk every day for 45 to 60 minutes and I feel as though I'm walking on clouds! The size runs true and the comfort is wonderful. This is the first time I've purchased Saucony sneakers, but they will definitely be my walking shoe of choice from now on!"
247574,1,"I'm forced to purchase shoes over the Internet given my shoe size and that the local (Caribbean) stores don't often have my size in the styles I like. I'm partial to Bostonian and Giorgio Brutini as they seem to have standard styles. This Bostonian is the first shoe I've purchased unseen and I am pleased with the fit and the look. The shoe is also stitched at the bottom and that's very important to me. As I've only had the shoes for a month, it's a little early for me to discuss longevity and will update on this characteristic if durability becomes a factor in the future"
172933,1,Very comfortable. You can stand on these for a long time without feeling too sore. Great shoe for a great price.
130402,1,"I ordered this boots for my daughter. The price is excellent for the quality of boot. She and I both love them. Also, the delivery time was awesome."
191688,1,"Finding these shoes on Amazon were like winning the grand prize in a raffle.My mother is 91 yrs. old and sent me on a ride visiting Easy Spirit stores totry and locate these shoes in this particular color to replace an older pair.I did not find these in any store. I decided to check Amazon and was nicelysurprised to find them. She is so happy and they are comfortable.Best part is making your mother happy, thank you Amazon."
135806,1,"I've been wanting Converse high-top tennis shoes for years now, and my husband just recently purchased them for me for my birthday. I have weak ankles from years of hiking, past injuries, etc. The high top style gives my ankles more support. I only wish they had arch support and then I'd be in complete heaven. However, these are tops in my book, plus they look stylish! I love how they stay in style no matter what! Thanks!"
252283,1,"Very, very nice shoes. They fit well and the 3-eyelet lacing keeps them snug and looking a bit dressy. Love the color. But HOW does one keep those leather laces tied? They are a pain to require repeated tying!"
208642,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
100165,1,"These clogs are perfect. As an artist, student, Gardner, and a worker, this shoe is great for standing all day long without a lot of fatigue at the end of the day. It's as if they were made perfectly for my Sasquatchian feet! Plenty of room for my toes and plenty wide.They look cute, they are unique, and they wipe off with a swipe of a rag....no fuss! I bought the Birkenstock cork liner, which seemed uncomfortable at first, but broke in quite easily and conformed to my foot. The liners/insoles clean up easily as well and have maintained their good looks for over a year now."
262816,1,"I ordered these sneakers for my cousin. He loves them! Great pair of basic sneakers that blends well with any outfit. Great decision, rather than over priced sneakers!"
338068,1,"En cuanto a calidad y precio Converse cumple con lo ofrecido, excelente calidad, durable y a la moda. Dispone para todos los gustos, edades, sin distincion, siempre innovadora"
88877,1,"I have tried Nike, Reebok, New Balance and every other shoe with my wide foot, but nothing comes close to the 2070. Having just ordered two, that should last me a year or two and I run every day at least two miles. This shoe is the one that they should keep for a long time. Don't buy the later versions when you can stockpile these.FYI, if these are out, I reccomend the New Balance 764 which are also good, although not as good."
314046,1,"they fit a lil big, but are comfy overall. Just wear thicker socks. Wouldn't recommend for someone with wide feet being that they run narrow."
285215,0,"I've worn these shoes for years. They are appropiate for the office and for dress occasions. True to most shoes, they are engineered to wear out after about six months. The soles develop holes and the heals wear down. On the positive side, they look good (simple but dressy - I don't like tassles etc), and they are comfortable. In addition, they can be found in stores for around $60 so I pay about $120/yr plus tax. If you are looking for an attractive somewhat dressy loafer, this is it. Just don't expect them to last."
65556,1,"The Propet Women's Mary Lou Oxford Shoes are exactly as advertised - perfectly comfortable for walking 1,000 miles. No problem!"
360734,1,After I got the right size these where the most comfortable dress shoes. I don't dance I just wanted a pair of dress shoe that I could actually walk in. I had to get a whole size larger then my normal tennis shoes. I normally where a 9 But I had to get a 10. I first got a 9.5 but they were just a bit to small. Unfortunately the company has a restocking fee which make sending them back cost almost as much as the shoes. So do yourself a favor and get a whole size larger.
207570,0,"I loved these boots and was crushed when I had to send them back. They aren't made for women with larger calves. I think these manufacturers figured only a size 2-6 would even want to purchase them. Oh well, back they went. I am still waiting for my refund credit too, it's been over a month since I sent them back.Signed - Double frustrated"
158577,1,"I really like Adidas and I have probably bought 20 pairs or more for me and my family on Amazon. Amazon has great prices on these and when they are on sale, well that's unbeatable!"
353007,1,"I have to agree with all of the other reviews except the lone disgruntled one that this slipper has to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I wear them everywhere, even shopping. I've had a number of compliments on how great they look. I can't wait to get another pair, hopefully in blue if they ever become available in my size. I was hesitant about ordering them, mainly because I never have ordered shoes on-line before and because of variations in sizes among manufacturers. I normally wear size 8 and ordered 8M which fit perfectly. Hopefully, this will help provide some insight on how the sizes run."
384561,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
202914,1,I bought these for my husband for our Disney World Vacation. They were great and comfortable for the whole week!
30205,1,This shoe is awesome. Well built and very comfortable. The lacing system is a bit flaky as you do not want to tighten your shoe to much fear of ripping the inside eyelets. Delivery was super fast and hassle free. Make sure you put on a leather protector.
211485,1,"I have had over 10 pairs of easy spirit shoes and have these in two colours. I have high insteps, high arches and hammertoes... and these are still comfortable. The support is not as good as in their running and training shoes, yet plenty good for walking long distances and taking public transport daily."
66250,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
265419,1,"I have owned these boots for over a year now but I did not want to review them before I had some sense of their durability. I have used them for hiking, swamp stomping, and as general winter boots and could not be more pleased with their comfort or quality. They have proven to be waterproof under semi-heavy use and show little sign of wear. The foot bed is well-shaped and extremely comfortable so the boots can be worn all day long without foot and knee pain (things I am susceptible to when wearing low quality footwear), though they are slightly warm in summer weather. Easily much more comfortable than my Merrel boots which cost close to $200 dollars and equal in quality. I have a size 10.5 to 11 foot on the wider end of the spectrum, I bought these in an 11 normal and the fit is great, though for particularly wide feet I believe that wide sizes are available. I can not recommend these highly enough."
163559,0,"This seems to be a very nice shoe, but they run incredibly small! My daughter is normally a 12 1/2, so I ordered 1 13 1/2 and she could not even get her foot in it. You then have to pay a $5.00 re stock fee to exchange the size!I would not have been so annoyed with this, had the description said runs small! We are awaiting the new pair. The original came pretty quickly (about 4-5 days) I sent them back a week ago."
322311,1,We love this product. We order these every other year to replace the ones we have and really like it.
162941,1,"Moved into a house with hardwood floors so needed good slippers. I love these. They keep your feet nice and warm, but not too warm. Can be worn inside and out. People complained of the hard soles, but I expected this given that they are a clog."
1374,1,there is not one single other item I would consider more vital to surviving an outbreak of the walking dead. these are a must have.
366131,1,My 94 year old Mother loves them as a replacement for her old ones of different brand. Glad she is happy again.
303020,1,Excellent product; arrived on time. Best brand of safety shoe on the market. Will purchase again if these ever wear out. This shoe needs to be made in women's sizes.
293032,1,"I have tried many different boots on my husband's feet. With these boots he no longer needs a foot support. The gel-like bottom takes the place of that. My husband has a scar from club foot surgery when he was a child, but these boots help provide him comfort. He could walk through other boots within 4 months or so, but we bought a pair of these around Halloween and they are still ticking. After shelling out the money for these boots, I can totally see why it is worth it now. We ordered another pair recently for more formal occasions. One order versus the other: If you order in the Fall expect the delivery to take almost the complete amount of time that is stated. If you order in the Spring expect to get them earlier than stated. Ordering around Halloween, we received them in about a month. Ordering at the end of March, we received them 2 weeks early."
121262,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
60029,2,These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable. I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day. The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up. I would not recommend these to anyone.
381099,1,"I love these, I fine them very comfortable, no problem to break them in, I have been wearing this brand for the last three year."
302535,1,"Crocs are so lightweight and comfortable. I've worn nothing but Crocs since my introduction to them 2 years ago. You can wear them with socks in the winter, without in the summer. Cushiony and mold to your feet for comfort. Can put them on first time and not worry about getting any 'sores' from rubbing. Love them!"
18251,1,Paid prioty post for this as had no choice . It cost $50. Double the price of the shoes. The shoes above I paid for the slower postage. It cost $19 for the three pairs. Was told they would arrive in about 3 weeks. The boots in 3 to 4 days. The boots arrived as said and three other pairs arrived the very Next Day!!!!! Felt totally ripped off in regards to the boots!!!!!'
116174,0,"I read the reviews and ordered a size up and they are way too big for my daughter who's having her ballet recital in two weeks! I would have to let her wear her regular practice ballet shoes and clean it with saddle soap just to make it look nicer. Now what am I suppose to do with these? I hate returning items and I guess I will just have to wait until she grows into them, hopefully she will still be interested in ballet next year!"
331581,1,"CROCS are CROCS what else has to be said, they arrived in good shape and they are being used for what they were purchased for"
97996,1,The crocs I ordered for my son was reasonably priced and was delivered on a timely fashion. I was very hapy with the convenience of the purchase.
221251,1,"these shoes are jst simply phenomenal. the way they feel on your feet are jst great. so comfortable, durable, and good looking.i would definately recommend these shoes ot anyone who adores bowling."
223259,1,"As a nurse I have to say I love these shoes! Bought them after an EXTREAMLY expensive pair of shoes came in contact with a code brown! These shoes have no cloth parts to worry about-- Loves the patient but didnt want to carry her code brown around with me in the fine mesh on my shoes! -- Also the treads are amazing-- no need for a knife-- toothpick etc to remove... dirt? just wipe them off-- they are really really comfy, convienient and best of all easy to clean. I have found the shoe for the rest of my nursing career here!"
136069,1,"They're Chucks, what more needs to be said. There is a reason they are still around after all these years."
179119,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
62928,0,BOUGHT THESE SHOES FOR MY GIRL. WE ORDERED BLACK AND WHITE BUT WHEN RECIEVED THE SHOES THEY WERE ALL BLACK. SHE SAYS THEY ARE COMFORTABLE BUT WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED FOR NOT GETTING THE COLOR SHE WANTED
306661,0,this is a really good shoe for the price. it is comfortable. a little thin unless you run on PERFECT level ground.
125777,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
172619,0,I purchased these to wear with my halloween costume. They look great but rub in several places so I am returning them. I tried walking around the house in them to test them out and it just won't work out without multiple bandaids and a gel insert for the instep. Pretty shoes. Wish I could wear them.
373669,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
288856,1,"While I'm not a runner, I bought these on advice from others that have to walk on concrete as part of their job. The anti roll and cushion soles are the best support I've had for my feet in a long time. I ended up buying a second pair, one set for work, and the other for home and biking.You can't go wrong with this shoe, not to mention you can get them in 4E widths!maloy"
196670,1,"Great service and product. I was surprised at the appearance of the shoe, even for a Stacy Adams. Great, great price!"
229139,1,"These shoes,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top are the ones that I've looked for all my life.They are extremely comfortable, well made, fit just right, keep you warm in cold weather and cool in the summer. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Please, follow the advice stated in the link regarding women's and men's zises.This is very important.Don't get confused with other brands or models. I wish they'd come in different colors, I'd get one of each."
288004,0,"I ordered a 40, what was supposed to be a women's size 9, but these were way too big. At least 2 sizes. I found a store that sold these and ended up with a size 38. I was told by someone else they had the same problem. Now that I know my correct size I would have no problem buying these again."
158831,1,"Bought this 2 weeks ago, really like it. very good looking and a pleasure to wear."
194877,0,"Sandals are comfortable and look good. I did purchase these hoping for a bit more fluids to be held in the bottom. Only expect a shot (standard bar shot) of liquid to be held in each sandal. With that this is more of a novelty item, so the price should reflect a novelty price."
85325,1,"I would recommend this product is a nice comfortable shoe, elegant and also the finish you have in your design is fabulous if you have the opportunity to buy it DO IT"
330848,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
232295,1,"I ordered these for my girlfriend and they fit perfectly, and are very durable. She didn't need to break them in as much as other shoes because of the solid craftsmanship. Highly recommended sneakers for everyday wear."
376554,1,"This product is great for avoiding falls and slips on the ice.I put them on when I leave the house, and then I take them offas soon as I enter the building at work, so I'm not sure ifthey hurt floors or hard surfaces that are not covered with snowor ice. Some reviews indicated that the spikes scratch the floor.This sounds pretty bone-headed to me. I mean would you wearshoes with golf spikes anywhere other than on grass? Sowhy would someone wear spiked grippers for ice on linoleum?I have a small foot - women's size 5. I purchased a similarproduct by another brand a few years ago, and I found it verydifficult to get a ""small / medium"" on my foot. I found itespecially difficult to take them off once my shoes were coldfrom the snow and ice. So, for this purchase, I bought alarge for my size 5 foot, and they work great. I have notrouble putting them on or taking them off. The backeven has a little handle to help take them off easily.Even though my foot is small, I have never had a problemwith these grippers falling off. I read other reviewsbefore purchasing, and some said that there were not as manygrippers on the bottom as illustrated in the photo. The pairof grippers that I received were exactly as illustrated.I find this product very effective and very easy to use.Great value for the price."
366813,1,"The Puma Men's Roma Shoe is simple but classy, yet good for everyday use. A great selection of colors assures that you'll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe. Not only do these shoes look good, but they feel good also. I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile!"
242051,0,The sizing is way off! My daughter is a 4. Ordered the 5 - too tight. Exchanged for the 6 - too loose but keeping. Would prefer to buy in a store but couldn't find.
117753,1,"It's hard to judge sizes with dance shoes, but Capezio recommends to order the street shoe size for this ballet shoe. My daughter wears a size 8 (toddler) in street shoes, but isn't terribly far from needing a size 9. I ordered an 8 & 8.5, since return shipping is free. The 8 fit her but it was tight and would be outgrown before the end of her dance class. The 8.5 was perfect, just enough room to grow to get her through."
17169,0,"I'm usually a size seven and a half and the reviews said it ran small, so i ordered a size eight. they were still too small. a nine would have fit much better. other than that, they were HOT, very tall, and i got lots of attention."
297780,1,"The Propet men's M3715 Leisure Walker is one of the most comfortable, stable, and easiest to slip on and off shoes I have ever owned or tried. They are a pleasure to wear, even in 100+ degree weather, and for lengthy periods of time, which is an extremely rare achievement. They are light in weight as well as soft enough inside to leave no achy pressure points or chafed areas... a sign of good research and design. The sole and heel patterns seem to provide a very soft cushioned step when walking, as well as a sure-footed grip on all surfaces encountered so far... another sign of a company that took time and effort to plan things right.If comfort with stability and decent style are what you seek, give these your attention. I think you, like me, will be absolutely delighted!___Fritxgibb________2010-07-27___"
240908,1,I love these shoes because they are top quality and perfect for narrow feet. Be sure to up the size because they run small in length.
232331,1,I bought these for when I begin nursing school in the fall. I wear a 7.5 and they definitely run true to size..they fit great! They are very lightweight and easy to slip on and off. The real test will be how they hold up when I'm on my feet for hours at clinicals.
228022,1,This a a great classic shoe--just too bad they're not made in the USA anymore.
229087,1,I bought these for the sole purpose of weightlifting. Excellent ankle support and flat bottoms without much heel make these an ideal shoe in the gym. These shoes provide very firm footing and i would highly recommend them to bodybuilders on a budget.
151386,1,My son sent me his list from the University of Florida and these were on them/ he opened and put them on Christmas day and they r a perfect fit - thanks!
92162,1,"The shoes I purchased for my feet are confortable and realy look neat. These softspot sandal looks good with my outfit, standing and walking, and even when I sit. The service on packaging and shipping was great, the shoes came on time and was not late. Thank You!"
382727,1,"These are my cruise and tour shoes. Gone through three white and one black pairs. Great looking with slacks,skirts,jeans or shorts. Wipe clean and so comfortable."
273311,1,"well i bought these shoes after reading the good reviews it had got. And i was not to be disappointed. They are really awesome!! They are real comfy and fit perfectly for every sport i play. I even wear them to office sometimes ;) Though after wearing them for a long stretch of time, i did feel something in my right ankle but it was temporary and maybe that is why i dont want to rate it full 5 star. But they are worth every single penny i spent on them.If you want to get good shoes which not only feel great but look good too, look no further"
312496,1,"I work for a major home improvement chain and walk on concrete floors for 8 hours a day. I know these shoes are for runners, but, this is my second pair and I can honestly say that my feet do not hurt anymore. They are comfortable and that little extra bounce and give really helps. Adidas has a made great product, more shoe companies need to think of the thousands of us who pound concrete everyday, they'd make some awsome sales.I love these shoes!"
191448,1,"I have always liked Naturalizer shoes and had some similar to the Scout in the past. I like the fact that I can adjust their tightness by moving the tab at the closing. My only difficulty is that, as yet, they are a bit stiff. However, I expect them to become more supple after wearing them for some time.Nancy Holt"
299031,1,"looks very nice, material is not bad..just a little big from my original size"
192356,2,I had been looking for years for this shoe as I had a pair that was 12 years old and just beginning to wear out..however this shoe only lasted one month before a piece of the leather on the top stitching came off..very disappointed but I also understand everything is made in china now including Naturalizer
25875,1,"Shoe pretty true to size, good shoe for the money. I buy Nike Shox often and decided to try these for the price. Not as cushy as a Nike Shox but also half the cost or less! For the price it is a comfy shoe and I would recommend it if you have wider feet and or don't want to send $90.00 and up for Shox."
282704,1,Rainbow sandals are the best flip-flop sandals that are on themarket. They fit well and will outwear any other sandals by 2 to 1.The quality is very good but not quite the heavy duty rainbowsthat I used to buy in the late 1970's.Island Surf is a very reliable supplier who ships veryquickly which I appreciated. The product and seller arehighly recommended.
233427,1,"We just got a horse and my husband needed riding boots. I have women's Ariat riding boots and have used them for lessons and trail riding and they are fine, so after reading the reviews of how comfortable these men's boots were I decided to get a pair for my husband. He has worn them a couple of times so far and said that they are very comfortable from the start. I like the looks of them. We are not in a Western part of the country, so regular cowboy style boots would look a bit over the top. These boots are dignified."
55109,1,"I have to say I got my Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Custom Red with Santa men's 11 shoes in three days. Very fast service and the shoes were really nice. They were a good fit, I ordered a half size larger then what I wear because I wear a heavy sock and needed the extra room. I told some of my other Santa friends about these and they each got a pair too. We all wore them at our Santa school in Santa Claus, Indiana and were they ever a big hit with the other Santa's. Everything was sent as described and I will buy from again."
247381,1,I have worn these shoes for a while now and I love them because of the low heel and still a classy look for work. I always order them online. They arrive quickly so it saves shopping around town for my size an color. They are true to size and I can wear them all day at work without any complaints.
285352,0,"These boots are beautiful and look like excellent quality. They arrived promptly.Unfortunately they are too big and we had to return them. The heel is too wide and the foot slips around inside. We ordered 1/2 size smaller than usual due to the reviews we read, but guess we should have gone a full size smaller."
218256,1,just an FYI - these things wear a size smaller than what you normally wear (i.e. i wear a 9M and ordered an 8M that fit perfectly)
238183,0,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
386102,1,"I have run for years in the 990's. It was time to switch to a shoe that would fit an &#34;everyday&#34; lifestyle. I was first fitted @ a NewBalance store (which I HIGHLY recommend). They determined that I had a wider foot (aka. &#34;D&#34;) and also noted that instead of me buying my regular 10.5...I would be better suited for an 11.So I purchased an 11D. I am happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised with a great fit and comfort that rivals the 990's. If you need to take a break from a running shoe...these are a must for people with wider feet and need room in the front.Also, Amazon handled the delivery with high marks (under 2 days)! Well done NB, Amazon, and the NB shoe store!"
385245,1,My teenage daughter got these over a year ago - they are a little discolored now from lots of abuse - but are holding up great! No separation of the sole - no rips or tears. Even the laces have held up!
209388,2,"Doesn't fit the way I want it to. Since I had to wear them and the return policy said they had to be unopened or unused, I cannot return them."
37519,1,"Ok. There is a reason that I am able to buy the same exact pair of shoes today that they sold back in the early 80's. They continue to make this exact same shoe because people buy them and people buy them because people love them. These shoes are extremely well made, durable, and look great. They do lack the modern sole and cushion technology of today's shoe but that is probably not why you are buying this shoe. They look great with jeans and go with almost all casual wear. They look great for about a year of constant wear which is really saying something. This is my third pair. I keep coming back. I will probably be wearing them 20 years from now.P.S. Contrary to what the picture indicates, I bought the black pair with white stripes."
364005,1,I would be very greatful if u can let me know if the white chucks is one size bigger then nornal sizing cause I didnt see the remarks like on the black ones.Thanks
224007,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
233687,1,"love the color, its comfortable, stylish, and made by a good company, i like their sneakers anyway, they should not make them in china though because those workers dont have many rights"
23433,1,This is a great product and very clever. Look forward to being the hit of the party
64123,1,These are great to throw on for shopping or running errands. No complaints. They have improved the sole since the last time I purchased them.
70930,1,"These would be great if I didn't compare them to Sanuk Yoga Mat. Here's how they compare. *nothing* compares to Sanuk Yoga Mat for squishy soft all-day comfort. These are definitely soft and comfy, but lack some of the underlying support that the Sanuk has under the soft. We need more quality like that."
232528,1,I got these boots when i was working this summer in the woods not ideal for that but they are comfortable especially to wear if your standing on cement a lot.
327594,1,My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them. He says they are comfortable and also look good. I would recommend them to anyone.
145411,1,"These Uggs are great. A little tight around the calf but well built. I like the slightly hardened sole, seems like they will last longer. Very Comfortable."
123896,1,"Received the promptly ,they are made very well .This is my second pair and just love the way they fit ."
371257,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
321432,0,"The quality of the shoes seem fine. The color is ballet pink which is different from pastel pink so I found the color to be as I expected. However, the size is vastly different from street shoe size. I purchased them for my grand daughter who has a very narrow foot. I ordered size 3N which is 1/2 size larger than her street shoes she could not get her foot into the shoe. I ordered a second pair size 4 1/2N which fit perfectly. I did not have an option for exchange. I was unhappy with having to order another pair ship back the too small pair and wait for a credit to my credit card. Wish I had ordered from Zappos where shipping both ways is free and includes overnight shipping. Shoes cost only about $3.00 more at Zappos but would have been better in the long run."
232643,1,This is the second pair of shoes I ordered for my 10 year old son. He loves them. Very confortable and easy to put on.
34349,1,My daughter was so thrilled to receive these wonderful shoes for christmas this year. They were different and that is why she liked them. They came in perfect shape and I couldn't ask for it to have been a better experience. Thank you so much!
92213,1,"You just have to try BCBG to know what I am talking about... this shoe is so cute b/c it fits great. The heel height if perfect if you want a bit of heel, because it will make you feel chic and subtle with not too much of flash. So, if you want more heel than a flat with a unique twist to a moccasin then this is it. BTW, I only bought 3 all in suede. This has got to be my favorite shoe."
182905,1,These sandals are pricy for good reason. They are so comfortable and they form perfectly to your feet. I also know that they will last me aLifetime.
138752,1,"These little sneakers, as I call them, are just like bedroom slippers! Wonderful purchase price and service.ThanksS. Wells"
18019,1,In my opinion those are very good looking and comfortable shoes. And it is a good price too.
238505,1,This product was very durable and very nice looking great product for the price lots of little storage space for small item.Fits perfect in pocket not bulky like some great for the person who doesnt like to carry a full size wallet. looked all over for item this place was the best price for the item. great company to buy from no problems with them when i had to contact them they gave immediate response. thanks
156542,2,"I bought a pair of Women's Plainview less than a year ago. I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months, so that the upper part is still very new and nice. Yet, I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there, which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes, I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand. I don't expect shoes to last forever, but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line. This brand does not meet that minimum requirement."
7161,1,"We Purchase these every six months, they are great walking shoes, very comfortable, sturdy and excellent for drop foot condition"
298121,1,"Great! Bought it for my husband, can't stop him from wearing them every day. They look elegant with short and long jeans, even with cool khakis."
74128,2,I really wanted these because I needed really comfortable sandals for traveling. These are not it. They scratched my feet and caused a lot of blisters. I sent them back to the manufacturer in the hopes that they could fix them. No such luck
222023,1,"I love Kipling bags for 2 main reasons - all the exterior and interior compartments and the durability. I have 5 now and love them all. This one is fantastic. I would not use it as a backpack as the tiny backpack phase ended almost 20 years ago now and I never liked that look in the first place, although it would be handy. I do use it with the strap as a cross body bag and without the strap for work. I am rather busty so a lot of cross body bags don't fit comfortably on me, but this one is longer so it fits perfectly. The strap is adjustable as well. I take a backpack to work as I bring my lunch and some magazines and whatnot and I like to have my hands free for the hike across the parking lot. This little purse pops right in and I can pull it out to go to lunch or breaks and have all my stuff with me. It has 2 main compartments, one with a double zipper. The double zipper compartment has an interior pocket that runs the length of the inside with a velcro strip in the middle of the largest pocket. Mounted in front of that pocket are 4 little credit card slots. I put my cell phone in one half of the velcro'ed pocket and my face powder compact/mirror in the other side, both fitting perfectly. I keep a small cosmetic bag and a few pens and prescription bottles in the main compartment, with room for a more small things. The other main compartment is large enough for my wallet, my Kindle 3, and my little Filofax (day planner). In addition, there is an outside zippered compartment on the back and a small velcro fold over pouch on the front. I keep all those items you keep in an inside zippered pocket in the zippered compartment, such as a pillbox with OTC meds, a nail clipper, small comb, another pen and a small lotion bottle. I keep a lipstick in a lipstick box with a mirror in the front fold over pouch as well as some sunblock, yet another pen (i love pens!) and some hand sanitizer. It fits a lot and having so many compartments ensures you can find something really quickly, which I love! Amazon has this purse at a great price too. Some people believe that Kiplings are overpriced, but their bags are made to last forever so it's worth spending a little extra money on one. Plus you get a great little gorilla key chain!"
209504,1,Basic loafer at a good price of $49.00 Look great. Nice thing about ordering online is they are NOT used as store samples as most small sizes are so they are completely NEW. Felt broken in after only one day
271141,1,"The Softspots Stephanie Classic shoe is a comfortable, casual shoe. It can be worn with a dress or skirt as well as shorts or slacks."
310895,1,"I love these shoes! They look great with jeans, scrubs, or shorts and they provide awesome support. When they start to look a bit dirty I just wiped them off with a damp cloth. Please start making these shoes again!"
319938,0,It is pretty good in general but the colour in definitely not pink. It is like skin colour so it didn't match the Leotard and the skirt which I ordered for my little child from Capezio also.
263151,1,"I purchased these for work and they lasted FOREVER! i basically wore them every day. I did finally have to throw them out because they got woren out and my feet started to get cold on the bottom from living in Minnesota, haha. But i would def buy these again!!!!!"
133102,1,Not only are rainbows the best flip flops in the world but Amazon has the BEST price on them - even better than ordering directly from their supplier - no joke!!
229071,1,Good. Cheap. Classical Chuck Taylor allready. Buy them.Enought comment. Remember to pray for the Converse. Kiss you dude.Bye. k?
246771,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
96956,1,"Very good ball control for an indoor soccer shoe. Looks attractive and easy to clean as well. The brown Sambas (retro) look better, but are not as wearable as this pair."
54441,1,"Love Keens, have owned them for years. Thought I would try to find some online ""less"" expensive than a retail store. Paid about 25.00 less for these, when they arrived was thrilled. (They were a requested gift) After the first wear, the complaint came that there was something around the pinkie toe that made one shoe hurt, when I checked it, there was a huge bunch of fabric where the inside was sewn into the shoe RIGHT WHERE THE PINKIE TOE GOES. I wanted to return them but the giftie said no and suffered with the pain, until I cut out the spot. That tells me they were seconds, and not sellable in the retail market, which is why I got the $ discount. Won't do it again, I looked like a fool. First and last time for this online purchase. I hate purchasing things to wear online, as my success rate is 30% at best, so I won't do this again either."
145840,1,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all."
324089,1,I had a pair of the betula clogs and they are great but with the heat of summer wanted something that let my feet breath more. I love the sandals more than the clogs!
275937,1,"i was hiking last sunday on the north east side of barbados, they protected my feet when i stepped the sea rocks along the shoreline.i used wear shoes and my feet are not longer wet i walked thru wet grass or i stepped into water.they are comfortable. i dont have worry about twristing my ankles no more or hurting my feet on jagged rocks.one hiking buddies stated that i must have on goat parts because he said, i was going very fast along the shoreline, sometime there was very little space for footing. i was going buy an other brand but when i saw them online, i wanted them! they are grrreeeaat!them light weight. before i bought the boots, i used wear a pair of running shoes and the rain comes or falls the night before! my feet would wet and will bring alot of discomforts to my feet but alas i have my htmaivwp hiking boots. they are great."
375268,1,"After placing my order for these shoues, they arrived very soon.They're comfortable (and ideal for me because I have diabetes; the velcro allows you to adjust the tightness of the shoes). Great traction on the bottom. Very nice looking. They appear to be well constructed and should last many years."
154612,1,The shoe I bought was extremely cool! The last time I had a shoe like this was about three years ago. Its a Vans Omar Hassan all black super suede pretty much like this design. The difference was eS was more rugged and tough looking than the Omar Hassan series. I would love to see eS create more designs in the same super suede all black series. You can wear it likewise in semi-formal attire. My only regret is that I didnt bought a spare one for the future.
95432,1,"I ordered these sandals online from Amazon, and while I don't usually shop for shoes online because of the sizing and having to trying it out first, it was a winner. The size was perfect and the fit is very comfortable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the price was a little high... a hundred bucks for sandals that will take some beating in walking, water ...etc. Still, they look great and fit great."
240569,1,Not many shoe companies bother to make different widths. That's amazing considering that millions live in this country alone and they can't all have the same feet width. The extra width means I no longer get corns and blisters. Plus the show is very good. I'm stuck on New Balance.
290594,0,Not as comfortable as the world walking classic shoe . i would recommend the latter although the pro walker is less money
44211,1,"lighter and more breathable than anything i've worn before (great for hot summer days) - so comfortable, it's hard not to wear them around casually - i hope they hold up for awhile, but i'm ready to buy a new pair when these wear out - definitely buy .5-1 size bigger as recommended"
10192,1,"There's definitely something to be said for still being able to buy kids sizes as an adult. There's also something to be said about the pair these are replacing being 11 years old. The originals outlasted many people's cars, lets hope these can do the same!"
3705,0,"only worn twice but seems decent quality for price, tongue is set low so wont be waterproof past halfway point and size seems pretty accuratehard bare inside so should use an insert"
164788,2,"Be aware that this shoe--in a WIDE- is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide. The shoe runs narrow. However,it does come in an Extra Wide. Although the shoe has little to no arch support,it is, nevertheless a ""dressy"" alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet."
98383,0,I was slightly disappointed about this purchase. The quality wasn't exactly what I had anticipated.
98860,0,This is a good work shoe for the weekends. I wouldn't use it necessarily for running a whole lot but more for errands and working around the house.
276085,1,These are very nice boots. Love the styling and appearance. They do need to be broken in a little when you first get them.
185547,1,"Bought them for my husband's bday early this year, so far he doesnt complain. He said they are comfi. And ithey are also very stylish in every outfits; formal and casual. They are also cheaper than in stores. They are white, so of course will be so easy to get dirty but to me the dirtier they get, the more stylist they are. Lol."
115979,1,This is my daily work horse. Can be polished amazing fit and feel. High quality I would expect no less from Cole Haan. Shoes were true to size. Will buy another pair.
139339,1,I am very pleased with this product. would definitely recommend to any one who asks me about it. Ellen Levitt
106616,1,"The sneakers arrived in a timely fashion, as promised. They were exactly what my son wanted. They were priced reasonably.They were of high quality and true to size. Thank you, Amazon"
17908,2,The third time I wore these turf shoes to a softball game the bottom detached from the shoe. The product seems very poorly made and basically worthless.
349842,1,This is a very stylish boot! I've been wearing mine for well over a year and it's still in great shape. A fantasic deal for the price.
172695,1,Loves me some K-Swiss whites. Get some if that is what you are looking for. Cant go wrong with K-Swiss
325821,1,"These are the best wrestling shoes I have ever worn, and ever seen to date. The Velcro top makes matches much simpler since you don't have to tape your laces. The shoe is very comfortable and has an excellent look, I just wish I could get my hands on a pair again!"
132460,1,This shoes look sleek no doubt about that. Ive been trying to get my hands on them for a while now but i can't seem to find them anywhere. Can anyone tell me where to buy a beautfiul shoe like this?
301197,1,Got these for Christmas for my 7 Year Old. They were a GREAT price! He's happy and so am I.
321876,0,"Size run's a little big, but we were able to put up with it in regardless. So we kept them."
349850,0,"I bought these because I needed nice looking shoes for work that felt like sneakers. They are comfortable, but they aren't sneaker comfortable. I have plantar faciitus and there is no way I could wear these without an insole like I do with my Nikes and Pumas."
140981,1,"I LIVED in Dr. Scholl's sandals as a teenager in the 70's. As others have commented, I could buy them for $19.95 at the local drug store. In my 50's now, I am absolutely thrilled to find these shoes alive and well. I just purchased my first pair in 30 years and still find them to be stylish and comfortable. Yes, the toe grip has changed but it still forces your toes to ""hang on"" and I still feel the pull in my calf. I do remember the rubber in the heel section wearing down so before I wore this new pair I took them to a shoe repair place and had them put on the small, clear plates on the heel that prevent this from happening. Cost was $5 but figured it was well worth it since, aside from that wear the sandals would have lasted a lifetime. I have enjoyed reading the reviews of this shoe. I agree with many and disagree with some. I live in Florida where we spend most of the year in sandals and flip flops. I plan to buy many more in several colors since they are WAY more comfortable and much cuter than flip flops."
9708,1,This is a great boot and it fits well. The foot is leather lined but the shaft of the boot is unlined and is very thin leather. I bought and returned them because of the unlined shaft. Boots are supposed to be warm and that unlined shaft would not be as warm as the average boot.
127239,1,These shoes fit great and look cool. They were shipped on time and looked exactly as described. My son's friends complimented him on his new shoes!
297942,0,"These sandals are super comfortable but I hadn't even worn them, but had only played with them before the key hole on the cap stripped. I would jsut recommend tightening and loosening the cap by hand."
192918,1,"I owned a pair of Tac Boots a few years ago in the Army; by the time I got rid of them, they were a couple weeks from breaking some of my toes. Needless to say, I was hesitant about getting another pair. However, these have exceeded my hopes.They take a little work to break in, but it isn't as bad as you might expect. Took less than a week to break them in well enough to be very comfortable.Less than 3 days after receiving these boots, I found myself doing backwoods trail maintenance on narrow, muddy trails during thunderstorms. As other workers slipped and nearly fell off the cliffs, I was able to keep a tight grip on the trail thanks to the solid tread.Today, I spent a few hours hiking part of the A.T.in TN/NC, then went to work at a rock wall for a few more hours; I've also been biking and walking around town. Essentially, I've been on my feet for about 12 hours. My feet are only a little sore at this point.The hidden pockets aren't much to marvel at. Not a lot of space. I just use mine to attach the clip for my boot knife.The side-zip feature is very useful for quick on/off, but overuse of said feature will quickly wear out the velcro cover.Boots are easy to clean, waterproof and lace.Put simply, believe the product description. These are great boots for an even better price. I would usually expect boots of this quality to cost at least $175. No serious complaints here."
345675,1,"Needed for a wedding and they worked. They are a little tight but I'm stretching them out, width wise but other than I like them a lot!"
175772,1,"The sandals are super comfy - and I have badly battered feet - so comfort is of top most importance. Have only one complaint - that Naturalizers don't carry the SCOUT sandal in Canada, so had to go via daughter in the USA, and she had to ship on to me. Don't understand that sort of merchandising. This is shoe - not some Cuban Cigar nonsense."
115154,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
86501,1,"I work on my feet everyday. I'm also walking in chemicals, so It's not easy to find a boot that isn't too heavy, looks good and can hold up under the conditions. I'm on my 2nd pair, the last pair worn daily for 12 hours per day lasted 5 years! These boots, this brand are the BEST!"
387467,1,"This shoe is outstanding. It is a soft leather that feels great to the touch. The wedge heel gives you height, but yet remains comfortable. If you're looking for a great summer shoe (I bought the white), but don't want a sandal.. look no further. I would definitely recommend this shoe."
321854,1,"...so why they are so hard to find, even at Adidas stores, is a mystery. Adding to that most stores not selling my shoe size (12), I thought there was nowhere to go. Thankfully Amazon has them. The interior of the shoe is very comfortable while giving good arch support. A very good buy for the money."
350685,0,"good looking shoe, well constructed, but size runs small, at least 1/2 size."
125414,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
263636,1,The classic indoor soccer shoe. Works well for everyday wear as well. Holds up as a shoe for daily wear.
193264,1,I received my Scout Sandal very quickly. It was in perfect shape and fit just like was supposed to.I am very pleased with the service and the product.
282600,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
223975,1,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my son....he hasn't seen them yet but the overall service dealing with Amazon is always great & the shoes look pretty awesome, I think he will love them"
61296,1,"This is my 2nd pair. This pair was stiff and needed some break in, but feel great now.Would recommend"
310740,1,"These sneakers are fantastic! I've always been loyal to Saucony, and this is the best pair I've bought yet! The sneakers are very comfortable for walking or running. They breathe very well and provide superior cushioned support."
27936,1,"For anyone who needs to wear something casual but not TOO casual like ordinary sneakers, but still needs the cushioning and comfort of padded-heel sneakers, Saucony Originals are the answer. They let you choose colours to go with different outfits and still walk in sneaker-like comfort. They are defintely more padded than most ordinary (and expensive) so-called 'walking shoes' in the market (I have tried them all over the years, even the most expensive brands). Saucony Originals beat them all. I walked through the Museums and Galleries of London and then explored the street sites for hours each evening in my Saucony Oringinals and was amazed to find that my feet did not hurt by the end of the day! Usually just a few hours walking on the hard marble floor of a Museum is enough to get my feet aching. My Sauconys allowed me 10 hours of pure pleasure with no pain!! Without looking like a dork! Now I wear them to my business appointments matched with smart-casual pants. I always get admiring comments on them (my first pair are a pale green combo).These are also suitable for people with real-foot problems. I have a very bad pronation and they have held up and held me up, wonderfully.The only complaint is that Amazon doesn't carry enough of the colour combinations in different sizes!I'd buy not one more pair, but a cupboard-full!"
147969,1,"High quality, nice color, nice size, and the shoulder strap extends to just the right length. Extremely good, especially given the price.The only slight downside was the lack of a zipper-closing pocket on the inside. (The only inside pocket is a small non-closeable one that hangs from the rim) Also, due to the thick material and grommets, adjusting the shoulder strap can be slightly more difficult than normal (However, you can still do it in two minutes or less, and it's not something you need to do often.)All in all, a definite recommendation."
33641,1,"I bought this converse for my younger sister that she badly wanted them. Transaction was very smooth, they got here on time, and she was really happy!"
7857,1,very comfortable shoe. I have worn these for many years & have many colors. Good with casual or dressy. I was so happy I found the black again. For a long time they weren't available.
310486,1,I ordered these on a whim and wish I had gotten a second pair in a different color before they sold out. These shoes are incredibly flattering on and manage to look fashionable and contemporary while still being understated enough for work. The fit is pretty true to size and the bronze finish is not at all too metallic or shiny so these look great even during the day with a conservative suit. I am pleasantly surprised and very pleased with these shoes!
247716,1,"I was so pleased when I received these shoes. I like Clarks but these are not only comfortable but very pretty. I like them so much that I have ordered another pair in dark brown. The price was good, the service was good and I just love the shoes!"
218392,1,"I've been wearing Chuck Taylors since the mid-80's but this is my first pair with a black outsole (all others have been the standard off white). I went to a party over the weekend in a backyard that was very little grass, mostly dirt, and was able to just wipe off the outsole with a damp cloth. If I had gone in shoes with an off white outsole, they would have been trashed. I also like the fact that these seem just a litle more ""dressy"" than most canvas Chuck Taylors. Highly recommended."
231348,2,"the left boot has completely fallen apart. throughout the entire circumference where the leather meets rubber, a complete separation has occurred. although I've owned the boots for over four years, i didn't regularly wear them. in fact, i exclusively wore the boots while i was camping or while up in the mountains. in all, i probably wore them a total of 30 times (that's being generous) and i never did anything more strenuous than walk or sit. my wife owns a pair of canadian made caribous, which she has worn for 15 years and they still look brand new! when not wearing the boots, they stayed in a cool, dry closet. to say I was disappointed to see the seam break apart while shoveling three feet of snow is an understatement. i also found the lacing system to be ineffectual and the heel strap equally ineffective. i would not recommend this boot."
350313,0,"These boots are beautiful and look like excellent quality. They arrived promptly.Unfortunately they are too big and we had to return them. The heel is too wide and the foot slips around inside. We ordered 1/2 size smaller than usual due to the reviews we read, but guess we should have gone a full size smaller."
325991,0,"I have worn birkenstocks before and I love that the footbead conforms to your foot. However, the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the material covering the footbed started to peel off on the back of the shoe (heel area). Otherwise, very happy with the comfort of the shoe."
373159,1,"I have two knee replacement and these shoes, give me strong support and solid structure for walking. So I get a new pair when they wear out in 6 months to a year.i"
141563,0,I purchased these shoes because I have a hard time finding my size 5. I have purchased these before through another place and they seemed to be more comfortable and softer inside. I can only wear these for a short time before my feet start to hurt and I have to remove them.
218398,1,"My daughter and I loved these shoes so much, she wanted a pair. She loves these more than the high top version she got previously. They are great shoe and versatile. I used to wear converse style shoes all the time when I was in high school, so it was fun to get another pair again. They fit comfortable, and felt true to size to me. Although a lot of people are saying they are not true to size. Because of that, my daughter and I bought the wrong sizes twice. So it confuses me why so many people are saying the sizing is off. So I am throwing my two cents in for that reason.My feet are about a 7 (one foot is a little longer than the other) and normal width. I'm not overweight nor extremely thin. I ordered the womens 7/ mens 5 and they feel just right. My daughter also ordered the size most closest to her foot size and she said they fit better than the other two pair we tried to over/under compensate with. Good luck!"
121598,1,Fast shipping (Amazon Prime) and perfect packaging. These thongs are awesome! They fit just perfect (size 15 medium) and are very comfortable. I just hope they last...
7929,1,"So I went to my local outlet today and got these shoes. I LOVE them. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is because they are NOT true to size. I had to buy one half size larger than normal. They have these great nubby things on the bottom that flex when you walk. It's like wearing massaging gel insoles on the outside! They are so comfy. If you are into the new low profile shoes, these are perfect. They are a bit snug through the widest part of my feet and that concerned me. But after wearing them all day, it's a good snug- like my feet are being nicely cradled. These are my new shopping shoes!"
48453,1,"My 4th pair of these and I have never been disappointed. I contemplated ending my running due to knee pain. However, I researched and found that I had been using the wrong shoes! I now have been running without knee pain ever since I have been using Brooks Beasts. I found no other shoe to correct over-pronation as well. Greatest on motion control too. You will like!!"
193354,1,"My Eastland plainview shoes are high quality and comfortable. I usually wear a 7 1/2M but after reading the reviews I decided to order the wide instead and so glad I did. Fair warning: even the wide is a little narrow at first, but start to feel normal after a week of breaking them in. I work in a retail setting and I think they look very nice under a pair of dress pants."
203559,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
108584,1,"These shoes are very comfortable. Good for work and home. I really like them. But it runs a little bit narrow. If you have a wide feet, they may be too tight. For me, it works well though."
222170,1,Holds up well and the sole is great for wearing outdoors. This is the third pair we have been through and we wear them constantly
302690,0,i am having trouble with my amazon orders i am still waiting for a bible tote i ordered in early june and have paid for. i ordered some crock shoes and got a double order and sent back a reply on this no responce .i like o order amazon things but have now stopped till it replys to my email on my wrong order also about my binble tote i ordered in early june . loretta bickle
347088,1,"Been wearing converse for years; great shoes, came just as promised in the picture and description. Cheaper, even with the shipping expenses, then in the stores where you can find all black chucks. Shoes packaged very well; shipping was ridiculously fast, had it in two days; great amazon experience!"
84864,1,"Shoes are fantastic, I was recommended them by a friend.The only thing I can say is that the sizing guide on amazon.com does not match the manufacturer's one. e.g. On Amazon a UK size 8.5 needs a US size 9. However Keen website (and the box they come in) says that a UK 8 is a US 9.Double check people...."
334823,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
304206,1,"Functionally, these shoes are great. They feel really good. I get good support on my problem feet, and I no longer have knee pain after running.I guess the only draw back is that these shoes look like ""medical"" shoes. The kind that would be prescribed to old folks with foot problems."
371616,1,"i have a few pairs of sensi ibiza, & am planning to buy more today.most importantly, they are as comfortable as the ugly crocs or tevas for long periods of standing & walking (as in DisneyWorld), but actually look really good on. i walked 10+ miles daily over a period of 8 days, without any blisters, ankle or leg pain.unlike some other sensi styles as well as crocs, the ibiza has arch support (moderate). also, love that they have ""drainage"" so water & rain don't collect in the footbed. they are easily cleaned ~ just wash with water, use soap if needed (impossible with tevas).do order a full size up (i wear 7 1/2 to 8 normally, but am a 9 in sensi footwear). also, they do require some ""breaking in"", but after a few days the rubber becomes very soft & pliable, like an ""old shoe"".summation: my top pick in any summer footwear for its combination of extreme comfort with style."
81060,1,great shoe but i had to receive three pairs before i got one that wasn't defective with regards to the toe seam.
351629,1,"I purchased these shoes as a gift for my aunt in PA. She said it is the most comfortable shoe she has ever worn. I will purchase another pair for her closer to spring but told her the red ones are year-round too. Next, I will purchase a pair for me. Many thanks. NJ"
198862,1,"buenos zapatos, excelente producto y llego a tiempo, por lo tanto lo recomiendo cien por ciento. saludos a todos ( a b c d )"
377048,1,I just picked up a pair of these boots and on the first use they felt great even after being in them all day. They also look good too. Great job Wolverine!
260393,0,"I love these shoes. However, I ordered the wrong size and exchanging them has been a hassle. It has been over a month and I do not have the shoes or the money and no one can seem to help me."
381916,1,"Easy Spirit Women's AP1 Sport Sneaker,White Leather,9 M Thanks, the shoes are nice and the service was great. Amazion is the place to shop."
196541,1,"My son loves Chuck Taylor Converse All Stars, and these are so durable! He wanted the high tops this time, so I got these for him. He loves them, and they came so quickly even though it was during Christmas season rush."
1810,0,These were my first pair of boots. Bought them for motorcycle safety training (needed footwear that covered the ankles) & been using them sparingly over the last year. The shoes are a nice dark shade of black but the lace rings are a little too shiny for my liking. Price could be cheaper too. No other complaints.
150137,1,"I've worn these VANELi dress flats for years and have them in several colors...and highly recommend them for both comfort and quality. They are expensive, so I always wait for sales. However, the last few times I've ordered these shoes on sale from this store on Amazon, the shoes have felt like they are at least a half a size too small. Sadly, I've had to return them."
81926,1,"My son was thrilled to find these Tims at this unbelievably low price. Amazon shipping was prompt as always, and the fit was perfect."
216067,1,"(I wish more people would write reviews on Amazon of the shoes they buy here! They sell thousands of shoes but no one seems to review them...)These are not the most comfortable shoes I own. The big toe of my right foot tends to get a blister from the peep toe. I think because they are made primarily of fabric, they don't stretch as much as, say, leather would.That being said, they are very pretty and make my legs look great. Although the heel is high, since it's a wedge, it's much easier to walk in than - say - a stilhetto shoe with a heel of the same height.They look good with jeans but also with flirty dresses."
285036,0,Should've gotten a wider width. A little tight.Great to wear with anything.As an Actor they look good in action sequences... Too cool!Rocky ViazzaniCapo Balia Films
23749,1,"I recently got these sandals for my husband and he absolutely loves them! We live in Hawaii and wear sandals/flip-flops all year round, so he wanted something really confy and durable that he could wear to work and to the beach. He said that after trying these pair he will never go back to any other brand or style. The band around the heal glows in the dark which makes them look extra cool!! Aloha :)"
32446,0,"Youth Pink Cowboy BootI purchased this boot for my 9 year old daughter who wears a childrens size 4.5. Youth size 4.5 is actually a woman's size 6.5. This was not clear on the sizing charts supplied. The boot skipped from a children's size 3 to youth size 4. Sizing needs to be explained more thoroughly. I thought the boot was overpriced also....it wasn't leather. My daughter was happy, however, and wore the boots for Halloween even though they were too big."
272809,1,"I am usually very picky about what shoes i wear and it was my first time ordering them online and not having a option of trying them on, but i heard good things about this brand and model, so i gave it a shot, i have bad support in my feet and week ankles, these shoes look kinda big, but amazingly they are very very comfortable and have nice support, and they lasted a very long time, i plan on making another order soon."
328994,1,I have been a loyal customer of the ASICS GT-line for over 10 years and I have not yet been disappointed.
170391,0,"This shoe is made of nice material, and is fairly comfortable, I'm a twelve and it is a tad big, so perhaps a half size down from your usual might be suggested, but they fit well, and most importantly, they're a great price."
209920,1,This shoe has been a real asset in the snow and ice. The recommendation to buy 1/2 size larger was right on. Fit great with no break-in time.
351068,1,"i love them! they are exactly what i wanted. thank god i ordered them a half size big, because they would be way too tight otherwise. i'm usually a 9 but i read other reviews and saw that i should get a 9.5. i'm very glad i did. yay! i love them"
229627,1,"I always thought these shoes were sexy on men. So, I ordered them for my boyfriend. He says they are very comfortable and he gets a lot of compliments on them. He knows he can tell me if he doesn't like them b/c I wouldn't care, so his testimony can be trusted.:)"
28132,0,"Nice shoe, with a great finish. You can pull off wearing these with high quality jeans or even a suit. However, they have rubber soles, which are actually not mated well to the shoe itself in several areas. I guess one can't complain for the price they're clearing them out for...we'll see how long they last."
276297,1,"I bought these based on reviews. First pair of shoes I bought online just from reviews. I went off the sizing in other peoples reviews and they were correct. I bought a 12 and my feet are a 11 1/2. I wasn't used to high heel hiking boots so that was an adjustment. I felt as though I was stepping into Ski Boots. I bought them six days before needing to use them enough time to try them out and go to a local store to buy another pair (which I didn't need to do).You WILL need to break these in. Don't expect to go and hike in these without doing this. For me I broke them in by wearing them to work for three days straight. I work at a desk most of the day with a walk during lunchtime. I would say four days would have been ideal but the shoes were very comfortable during the hike minus the minor bruise i had on my heal because I wasn't use to high heal shoes. It was bearable though and I wrote it off to me not breaking them in enough (or breaking in my feet).These are gortex and waterproof and I tested them out with a wide brook crossing. There were some rocks that the water was running over and I was deep enough to cover my toes. My feet stayed as dry as advertised. The hike had all the terrain you would find. Soft needle filled trails, moss covered rocks, old dry brook beds, roots, steep slabs and gravel.Heres where the shoes loose the fifth star. Compared to more pricey boots the sold are very hard and I was wavering on the steep slabs that were slightly wet. They gripped but just barely. Some better soles would be solid such as my buddies. But and this is the big BUT - for a starting out hiker these are fine and would be FIVE stars for their purpose. I only spent around 80 bucks on these and my buddy spent over 200 on his.If you are interested in reading about my first hike my buddy blogs about all his hikes in New Hampshire. We hiked Mt. Potash in the White Mountain region. It was a great trail for a first hike or even an experienced hiker who wants to do a quick hike. It took us about two hours up and two hours down with about 1.5 hours stopped. [...]Overall I think I picked the best first book, I expect to use them for shoveling in the winter because they look nice enough for me to wear to work (Business Casual). Give yourself plenty of time to break these in I would say at least a week. If you haven't worn high healed boots before you will probably get a small bruise on the back of your heal. I think it is normal and it goes away as you wear them more. The support in your ankle is key for any harsher terrain and slab walking you will do in your hike."
324114,1,"I got these shoes in Mocha in 2008 and even though I wear them quite frequently, they're still in good shape!They are really comfortable and I think the more you wear them and break them in the better they get! I also own a pair of Birkenstock Gizehs and I think that these shoes are very comparable to the original Birkenstocks. The only difference is maybe slightly less arch support, but I think these Betulas still give you support and, as I said, are very comfortable and durable. (I actually just ordered a pair of Betula clogs because I was so happy with these!)These sandals are definitely a great purchase and they give you the Birkenstock look and feel for a reasonable price."
290802,2,"These shoes are terrible. I read the reviews and took the risk anyway because the price was so good - too good to be true. My foot fits in fine, but my big toe (as another reviewer claimed) gets pinched even after a week of wear to break it in! Also, the ""leather"" start rubbing off within 10 hours of wear (1 day!) Other reviewers have claimed this as well! The shoe does truly look great out of the box, but a shoe that starts to get destroyed and is painful is not worth your money. Pay extra and get a shoe that is more comfortable and won't be ruined within a week.I bought a slightly more expensive Rockport and they are more comfortable and the leather does not just rub off! Do not buy this shoe.Bostonian is no longer a trustworthy shoe company. I urge you to look towards competitors like Johnston & Murphy and Rockport. Do not make the same mistake I did."
294666,1,These sneakers are comfortable from the moment you put them on. No break in period required.
179936,1,These shoes are great for the price. They are light and they let your feet breathe easily. Only con is there is no arch support so after wearing the for a while my feet hurt badly.
276787,1,"Outstanding boots, this is my 3rd pair. I've worn them for everyday and hiked the 400+ miles over the years in them... Not totally water proof (IE Don't go wading in them) but they are light comfortable and as good as boots costing twice as much."
350967,2,"I bought these boots after ordering the wrong size directly from the company. I saw that they were almost $80 cheaper and thought I had found a deal. The boots I bought directly from Danner were top notch. The leather was stiff, polished, and looked awesome. Unfortunately they didn't fit, so I sent them back and ordered through Amazon. The discounted boots arrived and as soon as I opened the box I knew I made a mistake. The boots were dirty and the leather on both toes was scratched. Instead of stiff leather, the boots sagged. They appeared to have been worn or possibly reconditioned. I immediately sent them back and went to the Danner website to order the REAL boots. Be careful ordering these boots from this seller. Had they mentioned the boots were not factory new quality I would never have ordered them. Get the real deal from Danner!"
213361,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
238607,1,My husband was very pleased with this Front Pocket bilfold. He liked the slimness and the soft feel of the leather.
270696,1,"I rarely leave reviews on anything, unless it is really really good. I just ordered these slippers because 1) I just moved into a new house that has hardwood floors and I have an extreme dislike for dust ending up on the bottom of my white socks (which happens now matter how much I vacuum and clean the wood). 2) I have CRAZY cold feet all.the.time.I went ahead and ordered these and wished like h-e-double-hockeystickes that I got the right size, since I read a few others having issues with wrong sizing. They were perfect. My feet are only warm when Im in bed, in the shower, during my hot yoga class...and now in these slippers.The inside padding is probably the most comfortable that I have experienced in a slipper and I am halfway expecting it to wear down, but right now, it feels like my feet are surrounded by clouds."

45480,1,"great price, great shoes - the market is filled with Top-Sider 'wanna-be's. These are the genuine article. I highly recommend them!"
66829,1,"VERY fast shipping. I bought shoes as a gift and was sure that they wouldn't be delivered in time, but they made with days to spare! And the shoes looked lovely. Thanks so much! :)"
230955,1,"Maybe it should be obvious, but don't expect to use them for anything besides playing racquetball (or whatever sport you use them for). I did not last long walking before feeling pains, and definitely not good for running or casual wear. Just thought I would point that out.Otherwise, it's great for the purpose it's intended."
130660,1,This being the first pair of dance shoes I have bought I unknowingly followed the advice of the other reviewers and ordered a half size up from my street shoe size.Do not do this.Order true to size. My dance instructor took one look at my shoes and said they were far too big.Your feet are supposed to be extremely snug in the shoe to avoid blisters and other problems.
194927,1,Brought these for my mother and she stated that these were the most comfortable pair of sandals she owns. I would recommend these as good buy as it is very difficult to find wide width shoes
180715,1,"Ok, I'm 47- and a professional female - probably heading back to my 2nd childhood - um - if I ever left childhood completely in the first place?Anyway, I hadn't had a pair of Converse Hi-Tops since I was around 12 years old. I had seen some of the more ""artsy"" ones, but could never find my size (average foot)when I was looking...and I knew I wouldn't be able to wear them to work if they were ""artsy"" Converse - because they are, after all, athletic shoes.I decided to buy the completely black Hi-tops...and they are great. They are comfortable, even on my 47 year old feet. I really like them a lot. Glad I bought them, and maybe I'll even see about getting a pair of the Artsy ones...or maybe a pair in pink???Hope you'll enjoy yours, when you get them."
378701,1,I just love these. They fit perfect and are so soft inside and out. My baby's 6 months and so I got him the 6-12 month size. Seems like they will fit for the whole winter season. I really love these - enough that I found my computer just to write a review! The brown is a nice chocolate brown. They look a little like mini-Uggs.

307736,1,"After seeing all the reviews about this shoe, I wanted to actually physically try on a pair before buying to make sure of the size. I love these shoes. They're comfortable and just great. I just wanted to post about the size difference I experienced. I have been wearing size (male) 10.5 for years now. I've bought many different shoes from different brands and this is always my style. After trying on many pairs of these shoes I finally found my size for these shoes. 8.5. A full two sizes lower! 8 was too tight and 9 was a bit too big."
49397,1,"I am delighted with this product. previously bought addias trainers,but found these are lite, hard wearing and very comfortable . After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented "" Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their "" . which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man. EXCELLLANT PRODUCT."
252869,1,"I've been wanting these for a long time......had them ages ages ago, and they were my go to every day shoe. My only issue was that I had to buy the men's size because the women's ran way too narrow."
103223,0,"Just received these ballet shoes and they are cute BUT they are way, way off in sizing. In the same order, I had also received size 6.5 toddler stride rite shoes and they fit just right (even a little big, which she will grow into the next few months) and also a size 7 Pediped shoes and those are way, way big (still planning on growing into these) So I ordered a size 7 in the ballet shoes and not only are they tight, her toes are totally scrunched up in them...I can't believe how off the sizing is!"
164413,1,"What a pleasure to walk all day in a stylish flat that also offers cushioning and good support and not have to wear clunky running shoes with skirts. I broke several bones in my right foot four years ago and can't wear heels. I also have narrow feet. Well, this is the first shoe I've been able to wear all day and still feel stylish without breaking the bank. I bought them in every color, including metallic silver and gold! A shoe for all seasons:)"
167122,0,"Yes, these shoes are comfortable, but they flip-flop against my heel, and have little side support. Too easy to fall off on a slope or steps. I'll wear them as slippers.The supplier was great: fast delivery, shoes in perfect condition."
262989,1,It is exactly as described on the post. I'm very pleased and I highly recommend the product if you like converse products of course
230635,1,Great product and very true to size. I would buy this product again. Thanks for making a shoe for a real woman....
157098,1,"This shoe/slipper isn't just for hanging around the house. They look great with jeans, and everyone at my school is wearing them! My favorite colors of the slipper/shoe are brown and pink. Enjoy!"
144090,1,This is fashion classic tall boot that give the women nice looking specially at this time in winter and could weather
291445,1,goodgreat value. glad I bought it. the quality is good and the fit is excellent and i hope you like it.
286122,1,"Have been wanting a pair of these for several years and this year I was finally able to afford them. Bought the sand color which go with everything. Very well made and, of course, are as toasty warm as everyone says. Next year I may treat myself to a black pair!"
57742,1,"i love these. if you are getting them, get your EXACT size. really comfy. GETTING MORE. happy buyer, and more to purchase!"
137454,1,"I like this shoe. It is simple and gives you a clean look! somewhat stiff in the beginning. Made out of cotton and does get dirty, but for the price .. I like them alot!"
177179,1,"I have these shoes in brown. I have been complimented several times on these shoes, and they match everything. I don't dress for comfort, but these are pretty comfortable. The only problem is that they look old quickly."
193048,2,The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width. they were way too tight. I gave them to a friend.
56769,1,"the keds fit perfectly. Usually I am leary about ordering shoes without trying them on, however these fit well and I am pleased with them"
207559,0,"I purchased my rampante last week and tested it for twice so far. I have to say I am kind of dissapointed because I thought these were the perfect soccer shoes for me. The truth is the shoes are a little bit too narrow, and there is no improvment in shooting compared to cheaper shoes. I used to have lotto primato before and the shooting accurecy is same in reebok rampante. However reebok rampante's heel comfort is way advance than lotto primato, or other cheaper shoes. Nonetheless if you don't wanna pay $200 for a puma or adidas predator mania, reebok might be the second choice for you."
241175,1,"After being associated with the 50's hipster and the 70's hippie, the 80's punk and now the millennium prepster these shoes have made the journey across time and generation. Made with a canvas material and a rubber soul these shoes stand the test of time and once thier broken in will quickly become your favorite pair of shoes . No matter the winter or the summer you'll find yourself pulling these out of the closet to pair with your jeans or your skirt. And owning one pair is never enough. A pair in every color low and high is definitly required for the true converse wearer. Buy your first pair today to emmerse yourself in a true piece of history and the future"
157375,1,I had a previous pair of these slippers and they really were comfortable but wore out after two year so I got a replacement .
203890,1,"I literally live in these shoes. And considering I reside in CA that is not an exaggeration at all! They are extremely comfortable, the foam sole molds to your foot. The fabric strap is very soft and doesn't rub at all. Though $20+ seems like a lot for a pair of flip flops, they are well worth the investment. I have burned through 6 pairs and have never had a single one fall apart. I buy a new pair to replace them once I wear all the tread off the bottom of the sole which takes about over a year of daily wear. They are incredibly well made, I once got my foot caught in a mud hole (the knee deep kind around natural hot springs) pulled the shoe out in one piece despite the tremendous suction that required my husbands help to free me. They are by far, the best flip flops on the market!"
365077,1,These shoes are light and comfortable to walk around in all day. Thier sizing is a little confusing. These run about one size larger than most shoes. I recommend using extra or replacement insoles.
13193,1,"You can't go wrong with this sandal. It has drain holes for use in the water, very durable and they're very comfortable. Even without wearing sandals all year I can put them on for a week and no blisters. What more could you ask for."
1591,1,"My husband has been wearing this paticular Hi-Tec Altitude IV WP boot for about 5 years. He says they are comfortable right away....no break in time. He is a farmer (wheat & dates) and also a commercial tuna fisherman. He does pretty much everything in his boots and loves them. They are also great hikers. We always carry a new boot for when the others just can't make another day or he wants to ""dress"" up. He is flat footed, so wears an ortho in it. His favorite shoe ever."
264813,0,I have bought these sandals in a physical store before and they fit better. The ankle strap just didn't have enough velcro on it or it wore off quicker than expected.
303077,1,"These shoes proved to be a little fancier than I expected, and look really sharp with any suit or dressy outfit. These shoes do not work with casual dress clothes."
174011,1,I have purchased this shoe several times because it is the best I have found in comfort and sizing. It does have some issues with the insole though. They run a little large and since I take a half size (sort of) that helps me. The size 10 is too big and feels like a flipper - not secure for water aerobics at the YMCA. So I am able to buy the size 9 and it fits me perfectly. I have purchased the aqua and hot pink and like them both except for a problem with the insole. The silky fabric comes loose from the insole - and the insole comes loose from the bottom of the shoe. I wear them once or twice until they come apart - then I use Gorilla glue and paint a thin coat on the fabric and glue it back to the sole. When that is dry - I put a thin coat of glue on the bottom of the sole and then try to carefully insert it back into the shoe without getting glue (that stiffens and scratches) all over the shoe. I like these shoes very much except for this insole problem - I sure wish the manufacturer would correct it. They are very comfortable for the workout. I replace them about every 5 months and that is with water aerobics 3 times a week. The color does fade in the chlorine but only a little. I do not find the bottoms slick in the pool at all.
389746,1,Very cute my husband is 67 but he still loves his converse allstars! Thanks!! Every thing is up to loving!
176545,1,"great shoes for exercise, really let the feet breath, just a little peaved I had to pay duty/tax since I am in canada. 5 stars on the shoes, and 0 stars for east bay..."
167753,1,"Pretty updated flipflop shoe. I like the crisscross style & the sole has some cushion which makes it more comfortable. It stays secure on my feet. The only thing it doesn't have is arch support, so I wear these less than an Orthoheel or Birkenstock which is my typical summer shoe."
213961,1,"These were purchased for my 14 yo and she loves them. She would definitely buy them again. They are durable, still look good after a couple of months and keep your feet warm."
121844,1,"I love this brand,very confortable,defenitely I will bought another one for my wife and my son.Highly recommended.Thanks a lot."
301100,1,I received my boots today and I absolutely love them. They are incredibly comfortable. They are better than Uggs. They really do run one size small. I'm so glad I read the reviews so I didn't have to send them back. I can't wait to show them off!
297553,1,The price was reasonable. An added attraction was free shipping. And the delivery was prompt. The product was just as described.
126395,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
385456,1,Reebok Ex-O-Fit Sneakers (black) are a classic. Nice style/look confortable and excellent quality. I have been wearing them for the past 15 years. Good work out sneaker.
340951,1,LOVE THESE SHOES! I have them in both colors...I wore them all around Europe (since stilettos are really out of the question). VERY comfortable and I normally have sensitive feet!
369844,1,"My wife says it's a very comfortable shoe but a bad color, and she asked why they don't make it in classic white. She also asked why Reebok doesn't make more women's shoes in a size 10.5, which is large enough to accommodate her orthotics as well as socks. Reebok has been her favorite manufacturer for years and she's sorry to have to start buying from others now that she has to buy a larger size than in the past. All in all, however, she says they fit very well, are light enough and are a great product for a very reasonable price."
100382,1,"I prefer and have worn this style of Reeboks for years. I was unable to find them in the local stores. Ordered my usual size and had to return them and eat the shipping cost. They were just to tight and a bit narrow. Just as a lot of other reviewers have stated, I guess they run a little small. I re-ordered them, this time one size larger and 1 width wider. That is why I rated them 4 stars instead of 5. When they fit properly they are nice and comfortable."
12221,1,"We have found that by shopping on Amazon we are able to obtain all manner of items that we would not be able to purchase normally. My husband is 6'6"" tall and is a big man with big feet as you would expect. He wanted to buy these particular shoes as they were something that he had worn in his childhood and loved so much. We were not able to buy these in Australia without actually having them especially made. Phil's foot size is normally 14 wide, so we opted for the size 15 US. Absolutely perfect and for a very reasonable price.We are very happy and even though some items are way out of our purchase league due to the varying shipping costs, we are still very fortunate to have discovered Amazon."
78714,1,muy bien lo que se esperaba y en el tiempo estimado 100 % recomendado muy buena la compra del articulo
132497,1,Capezio shoes have always been made well. These ran a bit small so I ordered the next 1/2 size up for my daughter.
60997,1,"I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks."
202616,1,"Most comfortable shoes ever! I wear these for work and they are very comfortable, look great and I love them!"
338864,1,"My cons were cheaper than getting them in the store and are my first pair. I love them they won't be my last. The people I ordered from through amazon sent me a shipping confirmation and on the confirmation it said it was a different shoe, but when I got them they were the ones I ordered from amazon so no harm done."
94411,1,"I got these after my old Birks bit the dust (after wearing them almost year-round for 4 years). I think the price was a bit steep (you can get them for up to $15 less from other retailers, except none of the cheaper ones had my size, unfortunately). The shoes arrived on time and are as advertised. I was afraid I'd get knock-offs but to me they look and feel like the real deal. My feet are happy. I would have rated higher if they were a bit cheaper."
217997,1,I am very satisfied with my recent Amazon purchase. My All Stars came significantly earlier than the prospected delivery date! I am extremely satisfied with the seller! Thank you Amazon!
87716,1,"As I have been wearing Earth shoes exclusively for the past 5 years, I knew exactly what I was getting when I placed my order. My sister & I both call them miracle shoes. They will feel different if you are wearing them for the first time, because the heel is a little lower than the toe; therefore, there is naturally an adjustment period of aproximately 10 to fourteen days. Before I started wearing these shoes, all I could think about was my feet and how much they hurt. I was on my feet my entire work day and by the end I had to concentrate on just putting one foot in front of the other. My pain was terrible. My first day of wearing these shoes, the pain was much better. After the first two weeks, it was gone! My back ache was less, too! I forgot about my feet, and I could concentrate on my job! I admit, I do have favorites and this Lazor is one of them..very comfy and weighs next to nothing! When I saw them on sale, I snatched them up! If your feet hurt, give them a try. I won't wear any other brand!"
172168,1,"The shoe seemed true to size and width. Fairly comfortable, although the sole seems somewhat stiff. I've only worn them a few times, so it's too soon to tell how I'll like them after they're completely broken in."
94948,1,"I WAS NOT ABLE TO KEEP THE WALKING SHOE'S, BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE RUNNING A BITNARROWER THAN MY OTHER BRAND OF WALKING SHOES. BUT I DO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM.I AM AT AN AGE THAT I PREFER VERY COMFORTABLE WIDTH, AND SUPPORT. LOVED THEVELCRO. KEEP UP THE GREAT PRODUCT, PROPET. SINCERE TRUTHFUL, DH"
211374,1,this shoe is for anyone that loves the F50s. not only are they a good cleat but they are comfortable too.
62880,0,"Bought white Keds for my daughter. She loves them, but after just 4 weeks they are showing structural wear and tear. They were only $20, so not over the top expensive, but I remember when Keds lasted for multiple seasons so I guess I am nostalgic..."
33308,0,"This shoe is okay, but not quite as comfortable as my Medley style or the AP1 style."
35250,2,"I bought these shoes from Eastbay. They are the worst pair of shoes that I have ever worn in my life. After wearing them for less than a week, I have identical cuts on both of my ankles from where the shoe jabbed into my skin. There is a flexible backing on the shoe which is sewn to the inside right where your ankle goes. As you walk, it grinds into your ankle and makes walking extremely uncomfortable. I HIGHLY recommend not buying this product."
223637,1,"Cool looking and comfortable, but better for cold conditions since the sidewalls are rather thick and insulated."
324140,0,"I should have ordered this as a size 12 or 11 1/2 if available but I still likeed the shoe and still have them for around the house lounging around but not good for any strenuous sport because of snug because of size, not the shoe."
249057,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
20908,1,My husband has been very pleased with these shoes.
48107,1,"I love these things. My daughter (who's in the medical field)turned me on to these. She, as do I, has a need for arch support because they're so high. She also knew my arches has been falling due to age (I'm in my late forties)and I need inserts in my work shoes. She's been wearing her pair since last fall (2006) and picked me up some of the Croc ""glides?"" in March.I liked them so much I ordered these Caymans for myself. Amazing support for ""difficult"" feet. I wear them whenever I'm not in my work shoes. I may look somewhat foolish (they're marketed at a much lower age bracket than myself), but I'm comfortable so I don't care."
226860,1,MY GRANDSON ORDERED THESE FOR HIS CHRISTMAS GIFT AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM. THEY WERE THE PERFECT FIT AND VERY COMFORTABLE FOR HIM.
353085,1,"This is a great shoe, though I find that it runs narrow. I could not get my left foot in the shoe at all. My right foot wentin with some effort. It is very well made and I like the padded arch support that is built in. I will re-order in a wider size.Idaho potato"
221897,1,I wear a 13 I ordered a 13 and they fit perfect. Very confortable. will buy another pair for myself for camping.
77016,0,"This is a good looking shoe and the quality is there, but if you're in need of a wide shoe be careful; I found the toe box to be a little tight. I won't be buying a second pair."
170747,1,"My feet are important and the quality of shoes I get my feet on are important too that's why I choose Vaneli shoes, specially for the office, I wear them at least 9 hours a day that's why I have these particular style in many colors. They are so comfortable and look very nice, the leather is so soft, they feel like gloves, true to the size, just make sure you order the right width. Nothing like Vaneli shoes!"
306967,1,"Excellent footwear, very comfortable, is used for all occasion besides to have an economic price. Amazon is very responsible, the order arrived fast."
280311,0,LOVE THESE but they are rough on the inside and wore a sore onto my foot for the first two weeks I wore them. By then they are too worn to return. I like the look of them though.
322382,1,"I ordered these for my 8 year old daughter who wears between a 2.5 and 3 street shoe, depending upon the shoe. I ordered a size 4, hoping to get a couple of years out of them. They fit her nicely with room to grow, but not so much extra room that they will be cumbersome on her foot while dancing. The elastic laces allow you to tie the shoe a little snugger which helps when buying a slightly larger size -- it allows you to make it somewhat adjustable. They quality is excellent. My daughter liked 2 things about the shoes -- ""they feel good on my feet"", and ""they are such a pretty shade of pink....they are like a baby pink, not that orangey-pink like my last pair""."
72884,1,"I must be one of the few people who didn't own crocs. I thought they were ugly and no ""plastic"" shoe could possibly be comfortable. Boy, was I wrong (at least about the comfort!). I was complaining because standing in the kitchen preparing dinner was taking a toll on my back. My husband suggested trying his crocs. Even 2 sizes too big, they worked great. So I ordered some in my favorite color. I am so glad I did. No more back problems. I wear them around the house instead of slippers because crocs have more support. They do have cuter styles, and I don't know if they all offer the same support, but I will stick with my bright purple crocs."
319972,1,"My daughters have been wearing this type of ballet shoe for years with no complaints. They're comfortable and reasonably good quality. I want to comment on the sizing issue, though. If you're buying for a child who wears a youth size 1 to 4.5 you must convert the size to an adult women's size by going up 2 sizes, otherwise it will be too small. So, for example, my older daughter wears a youth size 4 so she wears a size 6 in these shoes. My younger daughter wears a youth size 3 street shoe, so we order an adult women size 5 for her ballet shoes. Hope this helps someone :)"
210903,1,I love Easy Spirit walking shoes. They aren't a sneaker and don't look like one but that is what they feel like - very comfortable!
342579,1,"Very quick and easy, description was perfect. I went and tried them on in the store first just to make sure of the size. I usually where a 7 or 7.5 in most shoes, but wear a 6 in these.Delivered faster than expected!All in all it was a great deal!"
292225,1,I would like to have been able to wear the shoe. It was too little and was not what I wanted. I would recommend it for other to try however
204729,1,"I wear a women's 11, I have high arches and wide feet, but not fat feet, these fit ok, could be a smidge wider and a smidge longer, but they work still w/out looking too small. They feel comfy on my feet, I had a pair of Crocs that were awesome, but broke after a summer of regular wear, hoping these will hold up better."
341081,1,"This is just great and reliable shoe and I would only like to ask if it's possible to ship this straight to Bosnia and Herzegovina?If not, then it would be 4 stars.... :("
206963,1,"I bought these six days ago and they came in the mail today! I love them. This is the third pair of bearpaws I have owned. I love that the bottoms are rubber which make for good grip in the snow. I love the color and the soft inside. People on here are saying ""they are not as good as uggs"" but for the price these boots are compared to uggs I'll take bearpaws any day. I have ever owned ugg and I don't ever interned too. I live in maine and my bearpaws keep my feet war and dry. Just be sure to weather proof them. The boots are true to size but they don't have a very wide top so they're not good for people with bigger calfs. Over all I love them."
356325,0,The shoe is nice but they run really small. I am not sure if this is how dance shoes are supposed to fit but I wear a size 9. So I bought a size 9..they were tight so I exchanged them for a 9.5...they are still tight in the toe area. Be careful!!
232370,1,"I chose 4 stars because I fear 5 stars. Otherwise these shoes are great! I tend to step with my heel and my other shoes didn't have the strength that these do. My old shoes were so bad that when I walked parts of my feet would creak/snap (yes, obviously this purchase was overdue). I will say that I worried they would be too narrow for my feet when I first tried them on but after a few hours wearing them I feel great- no cramping or blistering. I am happy with the color! They look almost black at first glance but have a hint of grey/green. Great traction when I am mopping and cleaning up slippery floors. Did I mention the price?! What a great value."
23361,1,"I concur with all of the reviews regarding this wonderful flip flop. I have worn this flip flop every day for 1 1/2 weeks. I wear a 9 1/2 inch shoe and I purchased a 10 M flip flop. This size is just right for my foot. My foot is an average width (D), and the flip flop just fits me. If you have a wide foot I would not recommend this sandal. After the initial break in period (about four days) this flip flop is very comfortable. I mainly wear this flip flop indoors as a bedroom slipper. However I also wore it outdoors on a non-rainy day. Since the straps are made of leather, I would not recommend this flip flop if there is any chance of rain."
251616,1,"Love the boots, fit perfect. Brand new in the box with all the paper and wrapping from the factory. Shipping was fast and the price was even better! Wear them all the time!"
49748,1,"I bought these shoes last year and they fit great ,I wore to work with some jeans and everyone love these shoes.The heel was fine for work and my feet did not slipout the shoe.Also I got the gold because I like the gold and the metallic look also .It is not too much flash and everyone loved them .I have a lot of J.Renee shoes and these are one of my favorite.I will be ordering in the black and brown also .The price is also great.I price these shoes elsewhere and I cannot beat these price."
255988,1,Just ordered these shoes from amazon! Got them and love them! They are so light and comfy! Stylish too! Got my mom some and she gets alot of compliments as well! Awesome shoe!
145551,1,"As all ugg classic boots, they are the most comfy and soo warm. I wear them with no socks wonderfull for cold weather inside home or outside."
189544,1,"Very stylish, and comfortable. I have yet to wear them for a long period of time, but I usually can never tolerate heals, and this one has yet to hurt my feet."
303998,0,I bought these shoes because I have foot problems and my doc said they could help me walk better. They really did- for about 2 months. They stretched out quite a bit and no longer gave the support I needed. That's not good enough for the price. Now I am looking for something better.
185173,1,"Love these boots, short break in and now I feel like I could just go all day. I look forward to pushing them harder and harder. My wife bought a pair as well and loves them. This is a short review, but Hey! they are good boots."
349447,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
141173,0,"Nice pair of shoes, however, the beading detail on the side comes of easily, so you have to be very careful when you have it on"
351695,0,"The tops of these shoes are very long and look ""manly"" I ordered an 8 even though I am a 71/2 (since they don't have a 71/2) and they were too large. So if you are going to order them, remember the top of the shoe is very long and order them small. I wonder if they are actually mens not womens?"
278572,1,Great buy. Size fit perfectly. Normal wear and tear is almost unnoticeable. I gave them a four because in the beginning they cut at the back of my ankle but after a month or so of wearing them out they now fit like a glove. Came before delivery date. I highly recommend them. :) :) :) :) :)
160394,1,"They're Chuck Taylor's. If you'll like them, you'll love these. Black high-top sneakers were a great gift for the scene girl with black everything"
281511,2,"Well made, comfortable and easy to care for. The color is a darker brown in person compared to the photo."
346052,1,"I received these shoes the other day, and they're great, but I'm writing to encourage others to be sure to adjust the straps carefully and take a few minutes to flex the sole by hand before deciding they're not for you.Strangely enough, even though the size is a perfect fit, I found that the strap adjustments are not intuitive at all. Generally speaking, I have a wide foot (10W) and have to cinch the ankle and widen at the toes. Not so with these! I actually had to cinch a good bit at the toe, loosen the front of the ankle as far as it would go, and then cinch again just a bit at the backstrap. But having done so, it's a perfect fit.The other thing I did, upon finding that the footbed is really, really hard and stiff, was to google ""how to break in birkenstocks"" and found that a number of people advise manually flexing the footbed with their hands a few times. I did that, though perhaps not as gently as suggested, and it helped a LOT with comfort.If you're as new to Birkenstocks as I am, try these things before you send them back. You'll be glad you did!***Also, a note on color: I ordered and received the Cocoa Nubuck, but it is not a red brown as pictured, just a regular old brown. Kind of disappointing after seeing the lovely rich reddish brown color in the picture... but not disappointing enough to send them back. Though if I had bought them for color alone, they would indeed be winging their way back to Amazon right now. Just so you know.February 5, 2013 -- UPDATED TO ADD: I really found the color blah and boring, as I mentioned above, and the more I looked at them the more I hated them, actually. But $3.00 and a bottle of Angelus Suede Dye later, they're an absolutely gorgeous rich deep red. I also added some cheap copper bling from the beading section at Walmart to match the buckles, and now you'd never know how plain and blah they once were.One hint: if you've never dyed suede, google it thoroughly before you try. It's very easy but there are definitely tricks to it, and if you don't wear gloves and you don't tape off the cork, you will have a permanently ruined shoe. Follow the instructions to the letter, from people who have done it, and you'll be amazed at the results. I was!!!"
19032,1,These shoes are the best walking shoe. The quality is excellent and always the same. Highly recommend these shoes. An added bonus is the fact that these shoes are quite water proof.
100557,1,bought these for my wife. She had a pair years ago and loved them. she loves these too. will probably last 10 years like the last pair.
58785,1,"This climbing shoe is a solid choice. My wife climbs in these. They are comfortable, grippy, and have the unique (and very cool) Madrock heel hook.They are definatly a shoe as opposed to a slipper. For those who don't know climbing shoes are more solid than slippers which is better for things like edging or getting nubbins of toes to hold while slippers feel the rock better which can help you find holds better and place them better. The shoe vs slipper debate is one of preference.They would get a 5 star but the flash from madrock is just a bit better and you have to differentiate somehow."
54662,1,"I had to break into these shoes before they got comfortable, but shipping was fast and it's a great price for the quality of the shoes. I've never had Keds before so idk if it's quality has gotten better or worse, but you get what you paid for."
252928,1,"As mentioned numerous times, these boots are not accurately sized. I was burnt by the extra shipping cost of having to return them - $65 from Australia!- despite ordering a half size smaller than my normal US12. I ended up ordering a US10.5 (1.5 sizes smaller than usual),which feel about right. They are not super comfy straight out of the box but I get the impression they will soften and loosen with time. Nonetheless, they are certainly a classic and versatile boot which will no doubt be worn on many occasions and at the price, represent great value."
287674,1,I wasnt really sure if I liked this shoe at first but after trying it on i realised just how comfortable and stylish this shoe is. This shoe is awesome for basketball and just walking around
382122,0,"Its useful but not 100% unbendable/unbreakable though like I expected, you still have to be careful."
340113,1,"These shoes are a little high price wise, but you can't beat the convenience. Right at your doorstep and back into childhood for just a few extra dollars. No brainer. Will be back for more."
99901,1,I swear this has to be the most comfiest boots I have ever worn. It has fur in the inside even on the sole so you have warmth everywhere you go. I probably confusing the fur with the sheepskin but u get my point. These boots are great ! And they came literally 2 days later after i ordered them !
375215,0,"Cons-Extremely Stiff-Way to narrow-Long soles (like short snow skis)-Heavy-Squeaks at the ankles.Pros-Very DurableEven after 3 years, these boots are still taxing to wear. However like many others, my partners on duty love these boots."
211154,1,"Tengo estos zapatos desde hace mas de 4 a&ntilde;os; los compre originalmente para cross training, y termine utilizandolos para casi todo, son comodos y duraderos. Una recomendaci&oacute;n, verifiquen su talla en un vendedor local de Columbia."
92574,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
58894,1,Got these for a family member for a gift and they are nice colors and seems to be nice shoes.
176855,1,I bought 4 pairs of this shoe (in 3 colors) in Macys over the last 3 months... I LOVE THIS SHOE. I have been in search for my size and there it was on Amazon! It goes with almost any outfit and is super great when you have to wear heels and work retail!
19830,1,"I've had a pair of these shoes in black, enjoyed them so much I bought a pair in brown, too. These are very comfortable walkers that I wear as my daily shoes m-f. They look nice, and are soooooooooo comfortable. I had problems with plantar fascitis last fall... and these shoes, along with some other remedies, have caused the foot pain to abate. You can't go wrong with Rockport quality and comfort!"
236037,1,Excellent service and FAST SHIPMENT!
13566,1,"I bought this shoe because I used to wear them for dancing, I do not dance any more but wanted the comfort and support these shoes provide. Great cushion on the innersole."
72661,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
226242,0,"For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration."
61522,1,"I REALLY LIKETHESE SLIPPERS. THE PRICE WAS RIGHT, THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE AND FIT WELL. USUALLY SLIPPERS SLOP OPF YOUR FEET AND ARE USUALLY TO BIG OR SMALL. I REALLY LIKE THESE ALOT."
367353,1,"Fue una muy buena compra, excelente calidad, tallas ideales, lindos dise&ntilde;os actuales. Recomiendo a todoas a comprar este producto, se llevar&aacute;n una buena sorpresa y le encantar&aacute; si es un regalo para alguien."
307849,1,I got these shows and began to wear them right off to break them in. I have to say if you stand for a long period of time dont wear them. If you are weight lifting with them then they work great. They have no real arch support because they were originally made back in the day before they had arch support. But great shoes!!
210577,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
107666,1,"I bought these directly from Carrie B's (I live in Portland). They are fantastic practice dance shoes. The tops are soft, glove-like leather and you can wear them for hours at a time (they feel more like you're dancing in socks than shoes).They're particularly slick on hardwood floors, but I even swing with them on carpet."
334631,1,Communication and tracking was great. Product arrived much earlier than expected perfectly packed. Shoes better than expected.Thank you Amazon.
385280,1,"We were in need of boots for camp this summer. We ventured out this past week combing through 3 or 4 local retail stores. We found no boots. It then dawned on me to try the Amazon.com website which connected us with Luskey/Ryon's Western Stores. We placed our order that afternoon on Wednesday, June 14. The boots were waiting for us on the front porch Monday, June 19. The service was prompt, the price reasonable, the quality of the boot is great and we are ready for camp! Thank you for the convenience and quality of service. We highly recommend this product!Thanks!D. Boettcher"
316576,2,"When you get these shoes/sandals, they won't look anything like they did online. They are very cheap looking and not made very well. Now I know why they are trying to get rid of their stock at such a discounted price. I took them directly to my local Champs Sports store and exchanged them for a nice pair of Nikes. Don't waste your time on these cheap shoes."
19799,1,"This is my fourth pair of these shoes over many years. Most comfortable every-day shoes I have owned in a long time. Okay for almost every occasion except formal. Price has actually come down since the last time I bought a pair. Good value. My only complaint is that the quality seems to have slipped half a notch, especially in the stitching of the uppers which has a tendency to pull loose a bit around the nose of the shoe. Wish they made these with a velcro flap instead of the laces."
166147,0,"This slipper is OK for the price, I WISH it was available in 1/2 sizes also. The slipper is light and comfortable, but only suitable for LIMITED use outside."
93534,1,"The Keen Newport H2 Sandles I purchased about a month ago, I absolutely love. I plan on taking them with me on my British Vigin Island cruise trip where I can wear them along the beach and also hiking. The best all around shoe!"
238464,1,I bought the hot pink in this in a size 5- and it was exactly that- hot pink but with a black lining. I like it alot. It's worth the price.
277097,0,"I am a pastry chef and work standing on my feet all day in a bakery. I started to wear my pair of Crocs that I purchased for a beach trip to work. At first I had to break them in a bit, but they proved comfortable... for awhile. I'm very hard on my shoes (and feet for that matter) in my profession unfortunately, and I wasn't impressed with how my Crocs have held up wearing them daily to work for 3 months. For casual wear and definitely on the beach, my Crocs are fine, but they've not given me the support I need for work."
2788,2,HAD A PAIR OF NIKE SHOX THAT THE SOLE HAD SEPARATED SOME. PURCHASED SHOE GOO. APPLIED AND CLAMPED FOR 48HRS. ONCE CLAMP REMOVED SOLE SEPARATED IMMEDIATELY. GOO DOES NOT WORK!!!!!
134688,1,". . . . . . . . . . Terrific fit, great deal and they look good on tiny feet!"
77763,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
262655,1,These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. The price was the best I've seen anywhere. I couldn't be happier.
260080,1,"Prior to my Dominator 5's, my MTB shoes were from Lake. It's a tough world out there for riders with wide feet. I do not think I would have shelled out the bucks for them, but a friend works at a bike shop and got them for me at 25% below Amazon's price. The firm bottom on these give me much better power transfer than my Lakes. The cleats are also quite aggressive but doesn't seem like they will load too badly with mud. As to that ""water repellant claim,"" forget it! I wore these shoes today with my road bike on the street in a light rain and my socks were soaked all the way through within 10 minutes! My only other complaint is the mounting system appears to be pretty much SPD only. Finally, unlike other high-end shoes, the Dominators do not make you look like you should be piling out of the clowncar at the circus with the other cyclists with their shoes."
69102,1,This shoe is wonderful! It's looks great on your feet and are quite comfortable if you like high heels.
274221,1,"These are my son's favorite and he swears by their quality. They don't fall apart like other brands he has tried and believe me, he is hard on them. He likes the fact that the soles don't come apart from the uppers."
308314,1,"What else can you say about a sneaker that has been around for over 90 years. These sneakers are simply great!!! I got the classic black high top and am very pleased with them. They are comfortable, durable and stylish. On a hot summer day the don't heat up like a bread oven, like some sneakers do, keeping your feet cool and comfy. If they do get dirty or funky you can simply toss them into your washer and bada bing like new!!! They offer enough support for me to last for a long day of walking around town or work. One of the coolest things about these sneakers is that they offer a ""back at ya"" response to the more expensive and mostly ugly ""skater"" and basketball sneakers. A great sneaker at a great price. I love mine!!!"
226184,1,I bought it for my wife and she love them.... they even come with extra red laces... Everythin arrived on time and in perfect condition...Thanks
156698,1,"soft, comfortable and fit like they were made for me. All this at an incredibly low price. would buy another pair."
195802,1,"I have been running on top of the line New Balance for over 15 years. I'm overweight and pronated. As a 50+ year-old runner, I'm more interested in running tomorrow than if I got a personal best today. New Balance minimizes my injuries better than the other four top shoes I've tried from four other brands."
297931,1,"the title says it all. I love these sandals. They're a little more hefty than your run of the mill flip flop (especially when toting some unidentified liquids) and i believe that that is part of why my first pair lasted so long. I strongly recommend this product for anyone looking for a well made, built to last sandal, especially if you want one with a little more flair than most.For someone thinking about this sandal a few tips;Wash the inside out thoroughly before and after using the flask, especially before the first useempty your sandals if you aren't going to use the liquid in a reasonable period of time, it is plastic afterall and may develop a slight plastic taste if left for too long.After several months of steady wear you will notice these sandals (like most upscale sandals) conform to your feet and are even more comfortable.I don't recommend this sandal to people who fly frequently as they dont take kindly to your shoes having hidden compartments at the airport these days. (you'll get through just fine, just expect a small hassle)I will say I wouldn't particularly recommend this sandal to very heavyset people either...after years of use from me (a 6'3 170Lb male) my father (significantly larger) finally dealt the killing blow to them when i let him borrow them when he couldn't find his own shoes. (the sandals still work fine but the plastic casing of the flask was cracked beyond usability) I was surprised at this because they are very well made, and had served me well for years. But I suppose it was just their time. I have every intention of buying another pair, and another after that."
35645,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
115116,1,Do you have a Vans Old Skool Black White 7D(M) US ?Could you tell me on my e-mail?It's thiagomizuki@yahoo.com.br
14069,1,"This is my second pair of UGG footwear. The original pair of tall boots for the winter are on their 10th year. They've held up. The Slippers are something I always wanted, but was afraid it would cause my feet to overheat and sweat. After 3 weeks of constant use (I've even considered wearing them as a shoe to work) they have been great. I used to wear socks all the time in the house since I like to put my feet up on the ottoman and lay down on the couch, but with just socks I also had a pair of slip on shoes. This is the best of both worlds."
304259,1,"With the proper sizing of my foot by a podiatrist, I then logged on to Amazon, knowing I wouldn't be disappointed! My New Balance size 13 D shoes arrived well within my expectations.I knew I could count on Amazon!A very satisfied customer!"
8609,1,"When I was a kid in the 70s, there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out, but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards, either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings. Those sneakers were great for any sport, they held up under abuse, and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike. These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design, and come in a wide variety of cuts, colors & materials. I've got several pairs of low-cuts, one pair in suede with natural (translucent brown) rubber toe, another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber, and this pair, shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber. There are a variety of color combinations to pick from, in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile. They are some of the toughest, well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well. They're the ultimate casual weekend shoe, and the most recent ones I've gotten come with a lighter, shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert, giving better support. I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too, and honestly, the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands. They can stand up to serious abuse, especially the ones made out of leather."
265352,1,"This is my second pair of Hi-Tec Altitude IV boots and I really like them, the waterproofing is great. I only wish they came in a narrow width as the medium is a little loose for my B width foot."
221376,1,"I recently bought the Bearpaw Women's M405 10"" boot in black and I so love them! I had tried my daughter's very expensive other famous name sheepskin boots that grandma bought for her and found them to be so warm and cozy that I wanted a pair. Of course, I couldn't afford those, so I saw that Bearpaw makes a similar product at a fraction of the price. Well, living in Western New York state, I needed something warm and fast, so when Amazon offered a sale on Bearpaw, I ordered a pair. When they arrived, they looked sturdy, fashionable and warm. But the test is to wear them outside in a foot of snow! So I made sure to first use the sealant that came with my daughter's boots, and when they were dry, put them on and ventured out into the weather. I was so cozy, warm and dry, I couldn't believe it - I've lived 40 years up here with cold toes every winter! I've had them about 6 weeks and they are still every bit as good as the other expensive ones. I love, love them and highly recommend them to everyone!"
105781,1,"These shoes were a Christmas gift for my granddaughter and she loves them.. She says they are very comfortable and snazzy.When these Converse shoes wear out, she will purchase another pair."
180556,1,Thank you for excellent service and quick shipping. Even with shipping it cost me less for these shoes than atmy local mall.
25210,1,"My girlfriend received them as a X-mas present. She loved them and wore them everyday. She said they fitted like a glove on her feet. Also, they are really durable. The velvet-like texture of the front and sides does not lose its color...Recommended..."
182137,1,I love these flip flops! They're soft and have great arch support. I want more in other colors!
154438,1,This is a well crafted shoe and Looks great. If you are thinking about buying it you will be very happy.
353913,1,My son loved the boot will order again and will recommend them to family and friends. thank you very much.
200170,1,"Perfect, stylish, comfortable and good fit.They look great with just about any light colored bottoms.Make sure to get right size to avoid chaffing"
55463,1,"Keds is a classic and never goes out of style. It is always hard to find my size, 12W, but I found it here with no problem. Would recomment to everyone!"
372968,1,I love my chuck Taylors. They go well with Jeans or almost anything that I want to wear. Looking to buy the Chocolate next.
57211,1,"Keds is one shoe I can always depend on for the best fit, color, style and comfort. Washable, and wearable right out of the box, I loved Keds as a kid and even more as an adult"
249436,1,This was a gift and I will order more from this Company. The shoe was very well made and the service from L.B. Evans was excellent.
354802,1,I love shoes...I couldnt wait to get these...I had them in a few days and their great. I even got a pair for my son. I recomend the shoes and Amazon!!
21157,1,"I chose Prepet years ago as my everyday shoe. I discarded high heels and snug flats for what my young daughter once called &#34;old lady shoes&#34;. Well, I had begun developing bunions. It is a genetic thing in my family. Guess what?Wearing Propets was just what the doctor ordered. My bunion problem is minor compared to my mother who had to have surgery to cure hers. Can't beat that! I attribute foot health to Prepet styling. Yes"
350802,1,"Great shoe. Very breathable for the hot weather. Light, durable, and comfortable. The only downside is that since they are so breathable, they are not good for wet weather since they will soak through very quickly. They do dry fast though."
121170,1,"I have to say I got my Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Custom Red with Santa men's 11 shoes in three days. Very fast service and the shoes were really nice. They were a good fit, I ordered a half size larger then what I wear because I wear a heavy sock and needed the extra room. I told some of my other Santa friends about these and they each got a pair too. We all wore them at our Santa school in Santa Claus, Indiana and were they ever a big hit with the other Santa's. Everything was sent as described and I will buy from again."
125780,0,"Looks different in the photo, I wasn't aware that the silver buckle across the top was so prominent. Also it is defintely not comfortable to go walking around, a reasonable shoe for wearing around the office."
230579,1,"Satisfecho con la entrega y calidad del producto, entregado a la fecha acordadoluego de revisi&oacute;n todo en orden, muy agradecido."
370863,1,I get so many compliments on my chuck taylors' they bring back the good old days and so comfortable!! I wore these when I was a kid!!
61329,0,This review is not about the quality of the shoe (which looked quite satisfactory) but about the sizing.The shoe runs both small and narrow (even though i ordered a wide).FYI- if that happens and you have to return it- You will have to pay for the return shipping to amazon
335461,0,DUE TO MY RECENT FOOT SURGERY I NEEDED THIS ORDER DELIVERED IN AN EXPEDITED TIME AND PAID FOR SAID DELIVERY. THE ATTITUDE OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE WAS NON-RESPONSIVE. SHE COMMITTED TO RETURN MY CALL AND IT HAS BEEN ALMOST TWO (2) WEEKS WITH NO RESPONSE.
45856,1,It does not have quite the support I need in a shoe--wish that were not so as it is a beautiful shoe.I also need to have a heel that is rubberized as I found it easy to slip while testing out the shoe.
376447,1,"this is very good working shoes but only have have my brother size 7 1/2,too bad not my size 9 1/2."
187576,1,"I they unsign that the service of sending(parcel) in very good and efficient, there has come to me exactly what pedi and was delivered in the ruled date. Thank you!"
255442,1,"I absolutely love this shoe. I will be the first too admit, it's not the most supportive shoe. It has a very thin sole, so if your feet can't hack it and you plan on using them for a lot of walking, don't get this shoe. I love this shoe because they are great for my bike commute. They fit nicely into my toe clips and are stylish so I can wear them wherever my destination is. They breathe much better than the 574's too, which I have 2 pairs of."
318339,1,"Great shoe for people with poor feet. Fits perfect in size needed, construction great. Holds shape but molds to your foot after time."
65920,1,Love that classic Adidas style. The price is right where it should be in my opinion. Give it 2 to 3 days to break them in.
367874,2,"The shoe runs a little narrow, so if you need a wide, order up a 1/2 size."
70251,0,"These shoes are cute and match outfits very well, but I think that they forgot about comfort. If you plan on walking around for awhile, these are not the sneakers to do it in."
79397,1,"This is the second Converse Low Top I bought this week because of sizing error(my fault). I ordered a size 10 in Mens the first time because I'm a legit size 10.5 Mens in every other shoe I wear. The shoes were received quickly by mail and the quality is great. When I tried them on, I had a good amount of space inside the shoes to move my toes which was too much for me. These size 9.5 shoes are a perfect fit. The sellers advice is spot on about sizing. Order 1 size down from your usual shoe size if you want a good fit. Other than that, these shoes are great for casual walking and weight training. I use them for dead lifting and squatting. Definitely recommend these shoes to anyone!"
56801,1,Keds is known for quality and this show will not let you down. The only negative is that I purchased extra wide and it was no different than the medium width. There was nothing that allowed for my Mother's wider foot to fit into.
299529,1,My husband liked these shoes. He always wears dock shoes when he's not dressing up. They fit him just right.
98598,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
360713,1,"My daughter uses these for choral performances. Dancing is not her favorite thing but she tells me these are more comfortable to wear than the flat shoes she has. They look beautiful, in fact, I bought these shoes before to go with bridesmaid's dresses. They are dance shoes with leather soles so in order to wear them as regular shoes, some adjustments need to be made so they grip enough for everyday wear and to protect the more delicate heels. I have worn these shoes as dress shoes because they are comfortable. I would recommend them and I would purchase them again."
88645,0,I found these shoes were fairly comfortable. In the past I have had trouble with steel toes but I don't have any issues wearing these for a full day at work. I have not had an opportunity to test the ESD compliance so I can not give any information concerning that aspect of the product.
26395,1,"I have to say I got my Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top Custom Red with Santa men's 11 shoes in three days. Very fast service and the shoes were really nice.

120175,1,"Several of my friends swear by Teva sandals. The memory foam footbed is cozy & comfortable yet supportive. The straps are snug, making the sandals surprisingly comfy, even the night I literally had to run to catch the train. I liked mine so much I bought a pair for Mom & sis, too!"
350751,1,"Upon seeing these shoes on the website, we felt as though they were the shoes we'd been looking for. Ive owned Merrell in the past and enjoy them very much. My wife decided she wanted to purchase a new pair, for me, for Christmas. We had combed several sites when we came across these on Amazon. Looking at the picture, we felt that the walnut color was what I needed to replace another brown set that I previously had. We were wrong. The picture on the site dipicts the color as being much more brown than they actually are. They actually appear to be more of a gray color. The venting on the sides are also a misnomer. Most Merrell's displaying the side venting with the mesh material keep your feet much much cooler than these do. In fact, my feet sweat like a banchie. All in all, though, still the best in the market in their class. For my application of looking nice in any outfit and still able to walk out the backdoor straight up a mountain, you cant beat them. The worst Merrell's will still always be better than the best that any other company will offer. Not to mention the price. I promise you that for the cost of these shoes, in this class, you will not find a better shoe."
154143,1,"These shoes are awesome! They fit a little tight, but not to the point of being uncomfortable. They're also pretty fashionable. I would definitely recommend these for anyone, men and women. It was a great purchase. Free shipping is also included so if you are intrested I would tell you to go for it!"
196980,1,I absolutely love love love these boots!!! I'm a New Yorker living in Atlanta and im so used to wearing these boots so i was super excited to find them on Amazon...On top of the fast shipping they arrived before Christmas...These are my work boots and they were packaged just right... I'm very thankful...and great job Amazon!!
373586,1,"The heel looks like wood, that makes them look finer.They are comfortable and fit true size. I am 7.5 in sandals, that's what I got. it's a little tight but my feet are a bit wide. It does not hurt my feet, though. after two times of usage they are not tight anymore.They have light cushioning, this improves the comfortability.They are not very stable because the heel is thin, but after wearing them a couple of times you can get used to it, meaning that they will feel more stable. (I'm not used to high heels or thin heels)One of the things I don't like is the satin footbed, it picks up all the dirt from the ground (I got the white ones). The metal heart looks a little cheap too. The big heart is a piece of ""leather"" colored in silver on the border. I didn't notice that on the picture before.Last thing, some of the stitches that were holding the big heart on the left sandal came of, but the heart still looks ok.They look very cute on though. and they are good for the price.It is a casual look."
239116,0,"These boots are ok. They are not very comfortable at first, but once broken in are pretty comfortable. They are waterproof, and have good traction. After only about 9 months of moderate use, the rubber on the front has began to separate from the leather. Also inside, the cloth at the heel has worn through. Not as durable as I had hoped, but not bad."
356099,1,I bought a new pair as my old ones were well... old 15+ yrs. I still use the old ones these new ones fit the same and are comfy but they squeak like crazy. Both of them and i don't know how to make them stop. I've had them over a year now and they still do it. Which is why 1 star is missing.
206057,1,"This purse was just what I wanted!! Big enough for everything, but not too bulky!"
122182,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
12377,1,"I bought these for my eleven year old. She loves these, so, I don't really know how conforable they are because she really cares more about how they look. The price was the same as other vendors. It was just easy to order on-line."
260896,1,"I love Converse and this is my ninth pair. Not of the shoe of the same color though. I'm fairly meticulous about taking care of my shoes so all of the ones I own (some for more than 5 years!) still look brand new with moderate wear. They're comfartable, durable, versatile, and flat out cool. Go buy them if you've never owned a pair!"
216005,1,"love these boots. the tread design is well placed, and very functional. the heel doesnt rub my ankle wrong. i like the material as it allows for a good touch."
101412,1,"I purchased these shoes as a gift for my aunt in PA. She said it is the most comfortable shoe she has ever worn. I will purchase another pair for her closer to spring but told her the red ones are year-round too. Next, I will purchase a pair for me. Many thanks. NJ"
289377,1,Lasts about 6 months with daily 4-mile walks on pavement. Lasts about a year in the gym with exercise equipment. I get good angle support and good arch support. Washes well.
74457,1,We live in a wet climate so the yard is often squishy. These are great play shoes for here. It is also customary to take your shoes off upon entering houses so they are very convenient for that as well. The color is adorable and my daughter just loves them. The price was decent as well considering that the knockoffs cause horrible blisters on the insides of feet-these did not. All in all it was worth the purchase.
80442,1,"My husband is an almost exclusive low top Converse wearer. He has been wanting a pair of TRUE red not TOMATO colored chucks. These are a true tradition red and he loves them!!! Great price, better than any I have found in stores and they fit like a dream. Highly recommend these!!!"
372100,1,"I have been wearing Chucks since I came out of the womb. I've been through many pairs, and after I decided to retire my old black ones due to a blown out heel I wanted to go with something new. The white is really an eye catching color, and more subdued in person than some of the pictures out there. BE WARNED, Chucks are about a size bigger than your actual shoe size. For example I wear a size 7 in women's, which would be a size 5 in Chucks, but these are really too big so I went with the size 4. I find the white adds some contrast, especially if you wear dark colors like I do."
222502,0,"Moccasin was very plush, and seemed well made, but I wear a 7 1/2. I ordered an 8 as the instructions said to order up. But it was so big I couldn't walk in it."
126055,1,"Wow, these are the most friggin' excelent boots I've had in years. They are so unique in color and texture. The Vintage aging makes them feel broken in as soon as you put them on. Size for me ran true to my shoe size of 10.5 US. Super comfortable. Absolutely awesome with jeans. My wife loves how they look.As for Frye, I still have the same two pairs of Frye boots I bought 28 years ago. Just re-sole and re-heel once in a while and they should last decades. Great quality then and now.I also bought a pair of the Harness 12R in the Gaucho color, but I prefer these over the Gaucho and am returning the other pair.HIGHLY recommended!"
186804,1,"I just received my boots from UPS and I must say I can't help but be giddy about them. It's always a little worrisome for me to buy a size over the internet because I don't know if they'll fit, and I hate the hassle of sending it back. These boots are -comfortable-! I wear a men's size 13, and they are very roomy for my wide feet. They seem very well built and I hope they will last for years to come. I'm very happy!"
329605,1,"Never owned a pair of Tim's before. Took them out for an all day hike and WOW! Really resistant to water, comfortable, and are durable. look forward to owning these for a few years."
60318,1,"Since discovering Hi Tec some 15 years ago and found it to be the perfect fit for my size 11 feet (womens) I have stuck to the brand for hiking boots. They are stylish, waterproof, well crafted and a brilliant fit for a broad foot. This is a boot you can walk in all day and not have sore feet; I have never had one blister and they require no breaking in. In recent times I have been unable to source this brand in Western Australia, and when I finally found a store that carried them they were twice the price offered by Amazon. And thanks to Amazons sizing chart the mens size 9 translated perfectly. I have yet to be disappointed by Hi Tec which is why I have found it unnecessary to try other brands. The Altitude rates as the best to date. I cannot recommend this boot highly enough."
217889,1,Chucks rock! Got these to match with my 2 and 4 year old boys. They love when we all put our chucks on together. These never go out of style.
65083,0,"Bought white Keds for my daughter. She loves them, but after just 4 weeks they are showing structural wear and tear. They were only $20, so not over the top expensive, but I remember when Keds lasted for multiple seasons so I guess I am nostalgic..."
196543,1,"Buen producto, por el precio excelente, envi&oacute; oportuno, en empaque adecuado, recomendable!!Buen producto, por el precio excelente, envi&oacute; oportuno, en empaque adecuado, recomendable!!"
44534,0,"I was pleased with the shoes, they looked good and they fit well from the first."
273792,1,These boots do exactly what they say.They are easy to get on and off.They keep my feet dry and clean.I highly recommend these boots.
211369,1,"Cant really go wrong with K Swiss , have worn them before and love them. Dont typically buy black shoes but had to have them for work. Only thing I would suggest if you have not worn K Swiss before is to maybe try on at a store before ordering online. They run small- you will probably need 1 to 1 1/2 size larger than you normally wear."
258531,1,"I've been wanting Converse high-top tennis shoes for years now, and my husband just recently purchased them for me for my birthday. I have weak ankles from years of hiking, past injuries, etc. The high top style gives my ankles more support. I only wish they had arch support and then I'd be in complete heaven. However, these are tops in my book, plus they look stylish! I love how they stay in style no matter what! Thanks!"
310925,0,"Received this sandal last week, I haven't wear it out yet, but when i try it on, i don't think it's a comfortable sandal. Before I bought this I already know this is narrow size sandal, and I have regular feet, so i think it should be fine for me, but it's not. If you want to buy this sandal, make sure you have ""NARROW feet"". It's not a comfortable sandal..."
120403,0,"These are really cute sandals, however a little uncomfortable for me since one of the straps catches my small toe, but that's probably just me since my small toe is REALLY small. I'm hoping there will be some give to the stap at least that's what I hope because I really like them and bought two pairs."
87254,1,The slippers are really nice. I got size 15 for my son and they actually are a little on the big side which is good since he's probably still growing.
370908,1,"Did exactly what I thought they would. Which is, be shoes. I am still wearing them and probably will continue to wear them for some time."
2679,1,"My old Hi-tec Windhoek's finally wore out. I use these boots as my everyday and light hiking boots. Amazon's price for the Altitude IV is unbelievable since a local boot store was selling them for $84.00. Seems like a nice sturdy boot with agressive soles that should give me lots of wear time. The size was just right. The upper hook eyelets are a little difficult to get the laces to, but with practice it gets easier."
136433,1,The shoes ordered on this web site are satisfactory. Thanks for sending the order promptly and in perfect condition.
140479,1,"These do just what I want them to do - and they seem sturdy and comfortable. Only small issue is the ""teva"" tag in the sole of the shoe - I can feel it when I wear the sandals (though I eventually adjust). Probably with time it will press down into the shoe more.I'm not much of a ""flip flop"" kind of person, to I'm adjusting to the thing between my toes, but it's been a gentle adjustment with these sandals and they stay on my feet well."
19990,0,"It probably depends on the shape of your foot but I find the shoes too narrow at the toes rendering too tight a fit. Also, although durable, the soles are a bit slippery on wet surfaces."
252762,1,This is an overall good steel-toe work shoe for the price.Under 40.00 dollarsHave not had these shoes very long so I can't comment on how long they will last.
334077,1,"The most comfortable shoes as my boyfriend says, it's like slippers.He wants to get the black ones now. He purchased the brown oily wallabee."
22462,1,"I got this pair of Easy Spirit shoes to replace my previous pair of Easy Spirit lace-ups, which had been my favorite pair of casual shoes for the past 15-20 years (I know, hard to believe they lasted that long - Easy Spirit is a great brand!). My new brown leather lace-ups are well-made, stylish, and very comfortable. If you're looking for sharp-looking shoes that are easy on the feet for long periods of wear, I'd say go for these!"
306175,1,"For whatever reason I have always had trouble finding shoes that really made my feet comfortable. A few years back, after doing some research, I discovered the New Balance M1122MC (The single M is for ""Men"", the MC is for ""Motion Control""). I have been wearing this shoe, and its previous incarnations, for several years now and without a doubt this is the best shoe I have ever worn. It's is built around what New Balance calls an SL-2 last (or ""mold"") and and the extra room that this gives my foot in the toe box makes all the difference in the world. With out a doubt this is my Number 1 choice in shoes!"
298307,1,bought this as a gift for my cousin for a christmas present! absolutely great! the price was right and quality and of the shoes is superb!
373837,1,"Okay I came here to buy a new pair. The ones I bought last year are still working fine even though I couldn't wear almost anything else. I wore them EVERY DAY and EVERY WHERE, literary to bed sometimes and I just forgot I was wearing shoes. I LOVE THEM and am Ordering new ones Two this time. Same colour as the one I have and another variation.No one walks more than I do and these lasted a year! that's a record for me. And it's so damn comfortable"
81537,1,"100 por ciento complacido con la compra, llegaron en buenas condiciones y son de muy buena calidad. Altamente recomendados y a muy buen precio. Gracias."
304241,1,Lasts about 6 months with daily 4-mile walks on pavement. Lasts about a year in the gym with exercise equipment. I get good angle support and good arch support. Washes well.
10161,1,"These are really beautifully made boots. I bought them in black for my 12 year old daughter in the Big Kids size 5 and she loves them. Very high quality material and craftsmanship. Exactly what one expects from Timberland products. Best of all, I got them for approximately $50 less here on Amazon than what they sell for on the Timberland website. Highly recommended!"
21698,1,"Easy Spirit's Motion Sport Lace Up shoes:1. Provide all day comfortable (sometimes you forget you have them on).2. Come in great colors.3. May resemble 'old lady' shoes (not meaning to be offensive). Yet they match just about anything you wear (casual or business).4. Last a very, very long time. I am still wearing several pairs I bought five-six years ago and haven't had a problem yet.5. Come in a large variety of sizes."
356782,1,Muy buen producto y llego en perfecto estado. Muchas gracias. Suerte y que sigan vendiendo mucho mas.Saludos desde Venezuela
329548,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
149838,1,My son was as happy with this pair as he was with the other classics nylons that he has worn over the years.
329101,1,I have this pump in brown and black. It's a great shoe! I found that the black ones were harder to break in.But overall great shoe!
279919,1,We're Trojan fans and were thrilled to see these SC crocs for a bargain price. Everyone loves the bright colors.They have most of the big universities. Lots of fun to wear.
129188,2,"Material is the paper thin cheap stuff that you will find on 20 dollar shoes from wallmart. FILA used to use a strong weaved material that would last forever. Not anymore, they went cheap. No more FILA for me."
165317,0,"I love MaryJane's. I've had black patent leather ones before. These ones are not as comfortable as other ones I've owned but maybe I'll break them in and they'll feel better.They run a little small. I should have gotten a 6 1/2 instead of a 6.THey look good though, isn't that what counts? haha!"
361200,1,These shoes are the best. They are so comfortable and really cute. I got the lilac patchwork ones and I wish I had gotten a couple of more colors before they sold out.
29629,1,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It's very durable, much higher quality than I expected. It can hold a full load of ammo with no trouble. It has attachments at the back to hook onto belts, which my husband loves.We're so satisfied with this product, we plan to buy at least two more for the future. We go out shooting a lot and these are very handy. :)"
184698,1,"I got a pair of Ginger Reef sandals on a trip to California Adventure once upon a time. I wasn't used to sandals but in no time I had broken them in and they were so cushy and comfortable, they conformed to my feet. I wore them just about every day and they lasted me literally about 4 years. They were still wearable when I finally retired them, but they wouldn't have lasted too much longer. These sandals are the most durable articles of footwear I've ever owned, about 10 times over. They're great, though they do tend to get dirty over time... but they last."
184302,1,"These are quality moccasins, and extremely comfortable. The size ran slightly larger than actual size. I have another pair of Minnetonka Moccs and they were true to size, for some reason this pair is a little larger. I'm keeping them although they do slip off my heal a little but I'm concerned that if I go down 1/2 size they would be too small.Thank you for reading,Michelle"
102370,1,These shoes are to die for. I ordered them at 7pm and they were on my door step at 3pm the next day! Great fast shipping and amazing quality for what I paid.
146521,1,These boots are great for winter cold weather and they wear well. This is the second pair for my daughter--she's worn the others for four years. definite great buy and excellent price.
94981,1,"This is the second pair of this particular shoe I have bought. Roomy and comfortable, and easy on a painful back. Over the last couple of years, the shoes I have picked to buy have been Propet. I didn't try to buy Propet, but they have turned out that way."
25480,1,EXCELLENT product!!! well made boot should last for years if taken care of. I highly recommend this boot! Other reviews say heavy boot however lighter than my old wolverines and made much better!
79838,1,I had been looking for navy women's reefs for at least 2 years - and the don't make them! But then I found these!! Woo Hoo!Fit is perfect. I wear reefs all the time so I knew my size - and they fit great.LOVE them!
189009,0,"Of all the croc models I've tried, the Mary Janes rate as my absolute favorites! I find them amazingly comfortable, and now have them in 2 different colors which I wear all the time. The pulse red, however was a major disappointment since despite its name, it is not red at all, but an orangey melon color. Wasn't worth returning, so I gave them away as I would never wear that color. Too bad the color wasn't clearer."
149087,0,I've had my pair of the red canvas shoes for many yrs. Hadn't worn them for a while. They were just sitting in my closet. I then noticed that the sole on the right shoe was cracked. I really like the appearance of the shoe and would not getting anothe pair. Wonder why the sole cracked?
280769,1,"This is my 3rd pair. I went on my honeymoon with these 4 years ago. I went to Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji. Simply the most comfortable. Only thing is the rubber tends to wear off if you drive ."
386710,1,"if you're looking for comfortable but casual shoes, naot are a great choice. they're made in israel and dont get worn out easily. i have both the santa barabara style and the spring style and they're both awesome! they're a little pricy but they're definatly worth every penny!"
190475,1,Ordered these boots for my daughter last Christmas and she loved them. They were a nice looking boot for the money. Unfortunately they were too small and I had to send them back.
358414,1,"I was going crazy looking for a leather soled shoe that would fit. This shoe does run small. I ordered a half a size bigger and I can manage with that, but I think I could have ordered a full size bigger and it would have been a little better. Also, I do have wide feet so I ordered the wide width that was available. I'd say the width runs true. The foot strap secures with a buckle and not that loathsome velcro, that never stays closed.I would recommend this product, with the size adjustment caveat. I have flat feet so the arch support seams light moderate to me. The heel has good depth and the toe box is comfortable for my wide foot."
63485,1,"Most comfortable shoes I have found.After a few tests of brands and sizes, these are the best.I walk 5 to 10 miles a day .Once I found my size,my feet don't hurt or get tired.I add gel innersoles for extra comfort but it's not necessary.Concrete floors,ladders ,rough terrain,mud,rain;no problem.And they are beautiful.People ask me about them all the time.Enjoy."
303014,1,"Fit is true to size. Was a bit leary ordering, arches are usually an issue. I am on my feet at least 10hrs a day and have no aches or pains related to wearing these shoes. Toe is just wide and round enough to be comfortable without looking odd or big."
47502,1,"the quality is very good and the price is very reasonable. however, the size is a little smaller than the normal ones"
270770,1,It is so difficult to find shoes in my size so it is great when I can buy a well made shoe with classic styling in my size
368813,1,"The bag is well made. All the zippers work properly. Bag has 7 interior pockets, 2 are small, for pens etc.. I got the bag made of distressed nylon. It feels a bit rough to the touch. It will be okay over a shirt, but to wear it next to the skin would be irritating."
202816,1,"We have made several purchases from Amazon.com, and have never been disappointed. Each order has been received in excellent condition and more timely than was indicated. We are relatively new to on-line shopping and our experience has been exceptional. We now prefer on-line rather than physical visits to retailers. It is usually less expensive and service is fantastic."
247303,1,I have been looking for red shoes for months and was so happy to find these. They come in narrow and they are low heeled. The first pair I received were too small so order a half size larger than you typically wear.
29373,1,"These slippers are perfect for my 95-yr-old mother who is living in a nursing home. I needed something comfortable to accommodate her swollen feet/ankles, that had a good non-slip sole and that was also machine washable. These fit that criteria. Her foot is a size 10 1/2. Though the slippers don't come in half sizes, the 11 fit fine. She does, however, wear socks with her slippers, so be aware that could make a difference in the fit, along with of course, the degree of swelling. Mom likes that there is a ""heel"" around the back so her foot does not slide out of them when she's walking (shuffling). I would buy them again. In fact, I very likely will get a second pair for changing out when the others are in the laundry."
380888,1,"Perfect for women with small feet... I usually wear a 5.5 women's, and I got a 4/5, I believe. Very comfortable and goes with everything for summer!"
336175,1,"Excellent and cheaper than the official croc's website. These crocs have saved my toes from tables, doors, and bed a hundred times. They are lightweight and comfortable.It came on time, absolutly recommended.Saludos desde Caracas"
172275,1,"I was hesitant to buy a pair of shoes online but you don't often see the Eastland brand in my area. I fell in love with the simple lines of this shoe. Delivery was up to Amazon standards (customer-focused!). When I tried the shoes on they were heavenly! Sturdy, top-quality leather, and most-important, VERY COMFORTABLE. I sometimes wear a wide but the shoe is roomy with no constricting seams- true to size. I have had many compliments on them. I needed no break-in period for these shoes and that says a lot!!"
303919,1,"My son has dropped arch's and severe pronation from fast weight gain from all chemo meds. We went the route of medical orthotics and in grade school all he got was blisters and couldn't walk or any extra activities. We found these shoes and have purchased them ever since. Not only can he walk without pain, he's proud to say he's not last doing the mile run at school!!!!! I greatly recommend these shoes to any one I talk to, they've made a extreme difference in his life!!!!!!!!"
280135,1,"We have ordered the same shoe 3 times as it has some stretch and is good for hammer toes, it is a flat so the foot will not slide down. It would be nice to find something else but we keep ordering the same shoe. We have used amazon to order the VAN ELI shoe."
221406,1,"Love these boots. Comfy,cozy and most of all extremely warm. The only boot I've found that actually keeps my feet warm and dry in the coldest of winter weather. These boots look great with your jeans tucked into them or under your jeans. I highly recommend these boots to anyone who wants warmth and style for an affordable price."
161431,1,"Don't know how many pairs ive owned over the years but I keep buying more. Comfy, stylish and cool to boot. I'd give a 5 but i wish they werent as expensive..."
239720,1,This is the most comfortable all terrain shoe I've ever worn. I had to buy a second pair.
268729,2,"Bought this on the spur of the moment while Christmas shopping at Menards. Wasn't going to be a gift but for my ice fishing gloves/boots. I thought it had a heating element because it said it was a dryer. It's just a fan and a noisy one at that. It's back in the box waiting until after Christmas to take back as I don't have the receipt and will just get a store credit and there are better deals after Christmas to spend my $5.00 on. If the store was more than 11 miles away, I would probably toss it out and eat my loss. Gave it one star because there are no negative stars."
23734,1,"Alone. On the streets of Playa, searching for size 5 Pampers, I longed for refreshment and inspiration. Spotting a corner bodega, I determined that a cervaza was the only remedy. After making my purchase and setting out renewed on my mission, I realized my fatal error. The cap did not twist off. Distraught, I accepted it was not meant to be...it was then that I remembered the hidden church key in the bottom of my Fanning Sandals (Men Sizes 4-15). My mission and my faith were saved."
55266,1,"I used to have a keds as a kid and I wasn't sure whether I would want a shoe that I had during my childhood. I don't regret anything about these shoes, they are just as comfortable as I remembered them."
168226,1,"These sneakers fit both my orthotics and my feet, no more sore spots, I haven't done a lot of walking in them yet , but plan to. I wanted to order two other pairs (different styles) but sadly they dont deliver to Australia, very disappointing in that respect, The price was excellent and delivery spot on."
296426,0,I'm giving this shoe 3 stars for one reason. The width runs too narrow. I have had a similar sizing problem in the past and that was with Reebok. Otherwise it is a very attractive and comfortable shoe that looks like it it will last for a long time.
356971,1,Worn keds my whole life. Still love them. This is my daughters second pair of black. Think it's so cool that as a teenager she wears them.
215722,0,"Received the shoe in a box reading ""black"" but inside was in fact the white version of the shoe. Comfortable, but not fashionable for wearing an all black outfit. Contacted FootSmart via email and relayed the information. Four hours later I received an email stating that FootSmart would MAIL me a return label to use and send the shoes back. That delays my refund. Inconvenient, which is why I would rate this review as a 2.5 not a 3, but there was no option. The original order came with a return shipping label that, if I used, would lead to my refund being deducted $6.99 for using the label."
213580,1,I was very pleased with the quality and the price. These shoes are very comfortable and are great for work.
350990,1,"I purchased these boots for my granddaughter for Christmas. She was surprised and delighted...and it was a perfect fit!We saw them while browsing another site. The price was higher, so I decided to shop around. Amazon had the best price and Free Shipping. I ordered on Sunday night and I had the boots on my doorstep 3 or 4 days later. I saved in the vicinity of $40.00.It pays to shop around before making a purchase. Also, I was unaware of the spectrum of products sold on Amazon.The Dan Post Women's Mignon Leather Boots are a great quality for a reasonable price. Thanks Amazon!I'll be BACK!"
114730,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
8624,1,"It's soft, and it lasts. I bought my over 2 yrs ago. My company pays for boots once a year and they last much longer than that. Great value."
121059,1,Very happy with purchase! Shoes are comfy and just what I expected (also the shipped was super fast!).
215186,1,"I love this shoe when I'm on my feet all day, and still need to look professional. Comfortable and nice looking."
160666,1,"ordered for christmas for teen daughter, couldn't find anywhere in stores, so thanks! Appreciated the fast shipping too!"
307935,1,"I have worn chucks for several years now and have always been pleased with the shoe, but this was my first purchase from the seller and I am very pleased with the service and quick shipment of the order..."
269284,0,Why buy here when you can get the first pair at a Rockport outlet for $10 or more less and then a second pair for half off that lower price??Need to be careful. These days Amazon does not always offer the best value!
79073,1,Sneakers were a gift for son-in-law. That's the kind he likes. He's happy.
233449,1,"I ordered this product because i wanted a stash pocket like other ipath shoes. I was disappointed when i opened the box to find no stash pockets in the tongue. Its a, great comfortable shoe other than that."
23824,1,"A friend of ours got these flipflops as a gift. With the bottle opener in the sole, they are a big hit and a great conversation starter. I had to get a birthday gift for my brother in law who is 20-something and has everything. He loved the flipflops and they were a good quality shoe as well as entertaining for a crowd of his drinking buddies. They are not tacky and the bottle opener does work well."
76185,1,"Great shoes , although some people wrote that they got a slightly bigger size then usueal , i found it to be unnecessary , use your regular size when ordering. the shoes are relatively comfortable as far as high heels go ( I usually wear flats and I have no trouble walking in these at all ). The color is exactly as picture describes . A great addition to any summer wardrobe."
113990,1,"I have fairly wide feet for a woman, and these were perfect for my size 8 wide feet. The sole is thick and comfortable, but not so high that you end up tripping over your own feet."
33038,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
33431,1,"Reebok its that I want. You can wear those everywhere during the day. But they run small maybe for a number. I use to wear 9, but they didn't feet in my feet. so Think about this if you are going to buy these shoes."
147284,1,These boots are great for winter cold weather and they wear well. This is the second pair for my daughter--she's worn the others for four years. definite great buy and excellent price.
261943,0,Just what I was looking for BUT I wear a 7.5 and have a high arch. They ran small on me and I had a really hard time getting them on. It's a shame because I liked the look....has to send them back
284618,0,"I bought them for my daughter for Christmas, they were too wide for my her and we had to return them."
122302,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
224495,1,"This is my first pair of Chucks, and I have to say that I am absolutely in love with them. A good looking, comfortable, light shoe that goes with everything - what more could you want?"
324695,1,"Excellent footwear, very comfortable, is used for all occasion besides to have an economic price. Amazon is very responsible, the order arrived fast."
202111,1,"Please first see my review for the Chippewa 29416 boot to get a feel for how great I think these boots are. For most people, the 29416 is all the boot they'll ever need. But I deliver heating oil during the winter and when it snows and the roads are salted pools of icy slush water build up along the road curbs, which is where I must stand to work with my truck. In these instances the 29416s are not completely waterproof, and the little bit of water that leaks in negates all the insulation and my feet freeze. Bad.So after all of these years I said: Not this winter. I first tried to order the LL Bean ""Duck"" boots that they've been making for about a 100 years. But I did so with trepidation because I worried the rubber sole would not have the support I need and receive in a regular work boot. I worried that while probably perfectly adequate for hiking or trudging around, maybe not so much for actual 40 hour weeks of work. But I never got the chance. Turns out those boots have become all the rage this year with college kids and they were back-ordered until spring.So a little further research brought me to the Artic 50s (model 25492).When you first open the box you'll behold these boots with amazement. The craftsmanship, the leather, the stitching, the heft, the design. The real lamb shearling lining. Removable woolen sole inserts. The composite sole, complete with duck bill toe for attachment to ski bindings. You'll know immediately that these boots were not made in China, or Burma or any other such place. And then your next thought will be what a shame it would be to wear them! There isn't a finer work boot made anywhere and when you hold perfection, the temptation is to put them on display, rather than on your feet.But on my feet they went. Last night my wife warmed them up and liberally applied Sno-Seal and today, Saturday, off we went for a half a days work. As usual the first hour was pretty brutal on my feet, despite the fact that the laces were totally loose. But hours 2-4 got a little better, but by noon time it was definitely time to get my feet out of those boots! Next Saturday will go far smoother, and after the 3rd Saturday everything will be comfort and joy, I am sure. I always order Chippewa a half-size larger than normal. I've never worn wide shoes, so I go with the single E, but I did wonder today if maybe I shouldn't try the EEE width? Would the breaking-in be easier, or once broken in, would they be too lose? Hard to know in advance because the boot your break-in doesn't fit anything like the boot when new, and at these prices one would hate to make a mistake...These boots are cold weather only I'd think, unlike the 29416. And if you were to buy a pair for winter outdoor leisure activities (as opposed to work), I'd bet a pair could last a lifetime. I'd also bet these would be some fine footwear for anyone living in Alaska.I know, I know. Are they really waterproof in the ice water slush? Don't know yet, but I'll be back if and when we get any real winter weather in New England this year and let you know."
5914,0,"These shoes look adorable, but they're inexpensive and it shows. I bought mine in white patent and I'm satisfied considering the price. I think I'll be wearing them on Halloween or other special occasions that call for fun dress up. They're not hard to walk in, the heel is high but it's stable and the platform is high enough so that it's pretty easy if you're used to walking in heels at all. I wear a size 9 reliably but I've bought Pleaser shoes before and they run small so I ordered a 10. My feet were swimming in them. I returned them (thanks for making it so easy Amazon!) and ordered my 9 and they're a little tight in the toes, but not bad. Overall great dress up fun, but the quality is not great."
319164,0,"These slippers were ok, but definitely run wide. In street shoes I wear a 10 or 10.5 and I often size up to an 11 in loafers or ballet flats to accomodate my slightly wide feet. I ordered a 10W since these slippers are not offered in an 11, and they were loose even with the drawstring completely tightened. I ended up exchanging for a pair of Blochs, which come in longer lengths."
20963,2,"I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them. Now the D width is too tight, especially on my left foot. The shoes will be returned."
100598,0,"I was expecting these to be the same upper design as my last pair, and they are not. Birkenstock (or whatever company makes these now) has much less leather on the uppers, therefore the straps are thinner. I kept them because I think I'll get used to how much of my foot they actually cover, but I don't like them as well. I wear them a lot of the year (yes, even with socks in the snow), so I miss the extra coverage. That said, I'm giving them a try instead of returning to my search for the perfect sandal."
100536,1,"I love my new Birkenstock sandals. I have a very old pair and forgot how great a new pair feels. Received my order very promptly, and without any concerns. Would highly recommend a new pair and a beginning pair for anyone!"
214526,1,"I just bought these boots to replace my 1980's Sorel Manitou's which to Sorel's credit are still not worn out even after all these years but got tired of them and wanted new ones :).My first look at this boot made me want to return it asap, so much that away I went to back to Amazon to order a return label. because this is a BIG boot and yes its heavy too and made me wonder if this is really a mans boot.BUT then I reminded myself I wanted warm and dry like my previous Sorels and that I bought these for snow blowing, working outside, walking dog etc.. and not the day to day work, erands and stuff so I decided I owe them and myself to at least try them on before sending them back. And what a nice surprise, I found that they fit me perfectly, like they were made just for my feet! Wow..I can honestly say I was not expecting that.So now that I'm liking how they fit I'm really taking a good look at these, and I'm thinking I really really love how they look, the Shale/Stone color is totally awesome, and they are such a nice change from the samo samo hohum black or brown. And I really like the way the leather shaft is soft and bendable, its not so much that its wimpy but moves with you while still giving support and not at all like some hard to break in leather boots.As other reviewers have said they run big, but I would say not so much at least in my opinion. My usual size is 7-7.5 in shoes, and usually order a 8 in boots to wear a thicker sock. So with that in mind I ordered these in a 8 and I think the fit is perfect. My advise is to order your normal boot size and they would most likely be fine.I like how wearing a thicker sock still gives a little wiggle room and really thats how I'd rather have it fit, your toes can move around so they don't freeze or cramp up from being too tight. I like the wide toe box for my wider feet. I like how the sole of the boot is big and wide so that it gives you a feeling of being firmly planted on the ground.Could be a negative for some but to me they are big enough that I probably wouldn't drive my car with them on, but thats not really a deal breaker for me as they will work fine for my needs. These are very well made, have nice heavy weight soles to keep the cold out and warm liners that hug your feet and legs.So by now you've probably already guessed that yes I have decided I'm keeping these boots, I think they are really cool looking despite having big soles and I have over looked all that because they fit so well and its really hard to find a good fitting boot, and I have a good feeling I'll grow tired of waiting for these boots to wear out just like my old Manitou's.All in all I think these are an excellent value and product that will hold up a long time, besides that I like 'em alot and think you will too.In summary if you are on looking for a boot for working outdoors and want to keep your feet warm don't hesitate on buying these, who knows you too may just be be pleasantly surprised.I also want to take the time to give a BIG Thank you to Amazon for not only their great service but also for not holding ransom on the color combos of this boot and selling this color cheaper than other sites I looked at. you're the best!"
57827,1,they were great while they lasted (: after so many wears i donated the shoes. such a shame :( i miss them
177196,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
137024,0,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
231271,1,"wore them in last snow storm kept my feet warm and dry ,excellent , a little bulky but still excellent"
82713,0,"These sandals are really cute and look great, but they are not really comfortable and I don't wear them if I have to be on my feet for a long time. The fabric between the toes is not as soft as others I own and sometimes bothers me. I have other reef sandals that feel much better."
239627,1,"The new cut of the Garmont XCRs no longer fits me (too small) after wearing Garmonts for 20+ years. Had to return those to Amazon. Still miss the Sticky Walkers, though. After much browsing found these instead and ordered a pair.Zappos recommended ordering 1/2 size larger than normal, so I chose the 13.5 size. Fit is perfect and shoe is really comfortable, PLUS much lighter than the Garmonts. Even though these shoes are not officially waterproof, my socks remained dry after several walks in wet weather/terrain in Sonoma County.Traction is great in all conditions: wet rocks, concrete, mud, sand, even metal grates.So far, I've used them for lots of urban strolling and moderate country walks. Going to mtns of central PA next week where they will get a much more thorough workout at World's End, Loyalsock Trail and Rickett's Glen.I'm a very happy customer."
24069,1,My daughter was so thrilled to receive these wonderful shoes for christmas this year. They were different and that is why she liked them. They came in perfect shape and I couldn't ask for it to have been a better experience. Thank you so much!
267604,1,"Excellent hiking or everyday boot.Extremely good value and fit.Hardly any ""breakin"" required.I would definitely recommend these for anyone interested in a hard wearing boot,for the money."
15762,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
33172,1,I have a questionI have a questionI have a questionI have a questionI have a question....Are This shoes for men?Thanks a lot for your help
364939,1,"A shoe that barely qualifies as such, which is what I wanted by the way. This is one of the best shoes for drumming I've ever worn. They're light, comfortable, the soles are so thin you can really feel the pedals, yet they're thick enough to give you protection. Anyone who's ever drummed in bare feet will know what I'm talking about. They almost feel like slippers and more importantly look cool especially if you're wearing a black leather jacket, blue jeans, t-shirt and your name is ""something"" Ramone."
86187,1,"I heard about these shoes from fellow RN. So I wanted to try them out. I was not disappointed. They are very comfortable, good arch support, and my feet dont hurt at the end of a shift."
294345,1,"just love these boots. needed a plain black pair.. didnt want a heavy boot or a ridiculous price. so of course i went to Amazon and looked for timberland boots. my favorite place to shop and my favorite boot manufacturer. got a great price- fast delivery and a pair of boots in perfect condition. very happy with this purchase. i am a womens size 7= a 5.5 big kid in almost all timberlands. this is the only place that gives me the 3 things i need when buying tims, size,variety of design and prices i love! best part is i can shop in my pajamas :)"
378798,1,"These boots are very nice and warm, so good for a baby that is trying to walk, my baby wear them the whole day without marks of the elastic bands, they stay in his feet and look really cool on him - he was 15 months old when I bought them and they still have room for at least 2 more months (he is 5 in shoes for babies right now) - I really recommend them"
327586,1,Thank you! Quick service and just as described. Perfect fit!
21261,1,"They are nice boots they fit my daughter just great. She wears them with pride and looks good at her horse shows, they go great with her outfit."
62274,1,"I never know, when buying shoes over the internet, if they size will be right. These shoes are true to size, good quality, and fit perfectly!"
175409,1,Super comfortable.I have truly enjoyed my pair and plan to order more in a variety of colors.I can wear these all day without any foot issues. Very durable shoe.
221665,1,"I love these shoes. I have wide feet, so I normally buy the mens version, which fits better. Womens are too narrow. I'm on my second pair and I have had this pair for at least 5 years. These shoes got me through college (which meant lots of walking across campus) on vacations, horse back riding, climbing, hiking, biking, and who knows what else. They are still comfy but beginning to look a little scruffy, so I can't wear them to nicer places or work. I HIGHLY recommend these shoes."
343025,1,The golf sandles are very comfortable and hold up well on any golf course. I would recommend them in hot weather.
236245,1,"These boots do exactly what I purchased them for, great ankle support. The price is excellent too. Very comfortable and supportive. Great traction too, took them hiking on Thanksgiving day out in the boonies of what the locals here in Western Colorado call the &#34;adobes&#34;, in rocky canyons and never lost my footing once. Thanks."
360275,1,"I have a daughter with hard to fit feet. The 9.5 wides were just the trick. She finds these shoes comfortable, and a perfect fit for her size 9.5 wide foot. Just what she needed. I thought about going up a size, and am glad I did not. These are for my 12 year old daughter who needed them for a play. I would get them again."
78187,1,I bought these for my mother who has had lifelong shopping issues in regards to her feet. She said she loves these shoes and they fit wonderfully.
293859,1,"i gotta say, these are the best shoes i have ever been lucky enough to find. when i wear 'em it's almost like they're not there. they're still very comfortable but it's a very light shoe which is what i wanted. worth every penny, i say"
308834,1,I really like the Easy Spirit shoe products... this shoe Jumper is wonderful... the only one that I like better and is just about like it (but made better is the Easy Spirit Threshold - available only at JC Penney that I can figure out). The design and support are terrific!
109058,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
17783,1,"Site after site has these rated as 5 stars. After a dogged hunt for made in USA boots that looked good, weren't western style and could stand up to the rigors of motorcycling I arrived at these suckers. And how glad I am for that. This review primarily focuses on these boots' performance as a motorcycle boot. I am confident they stand up well under other conditions too, but you can find many of those reviews elsewhere.These are quality inside and out. The stitching is perfect, no frayed anything anywhere. It's gonna hold together. The leather has enough thickness for some warmth and road protection, and the breathability is great for all conditions except rather wet. I applied some waterproofing agent to mine, and so far so good. Without waterproofing agent expect about 30 minutes of semi-wet riding (read: light drizzle) before your feet start to get damp.What I particularly love about these boots are that the leather is just the right thickness. Not too thin as to be flimsy or weak protection, but not too thick to be stiff and unwieldy. I also really dig the grippy soles, I have never had a motorcycle boot that makes me feel as sure-footed at a stoplight as these. Between those soles and the great ankle fit, you're staying put when you need to. Most excellent.Last but not least, they look damn good. I prefer a more modern flatter toe, but you can't beat the classic paratrooper boot look for just raw badass looks. I get compliments 'em all the time. Goes well under or over pants, depending on the look you're going for. If I wasn't riding with 'em all the time, I'd leave the laces a bit undone over the pants, looks good that way too (think early 90's...). I have a blog focusing on made in USA goods, if that interests you: [...]Thanks for reading!"
19444,0,"I wear a size 10 shoe and this is a bit short for me, not uncomfortable but I would like a bit more length. It hits my heal half way so that it feels like my the slipper may slide off my heal. If I had tried these slippers on in a store I would not have purchased them. The sole is comfortable."
320331,1,I ordered these for my daughter who wears a size 9 1/2. After reading all the reviews I ordered her a size 10 and they were too large. I should have gone with her regular shoe size. Great shoes though.
36623,0,"I have worn Danner boots in the military for over 15 years. I have always worn a size 11EE. This boot in that size did NOT fit me. It was very narrow with a narrow toe box. I gave them 3 stars because they look like a well made boot and I seriously wish they would have fit. However, I do love my military issued Danners and give them 10 stars!!"
297544,1,I've been wearing this exact Executive Imperial Wingtip shoe for more than twenty years. They are extremely durable and still take a great shine for the entire life of the shoe. They break in quickly and run true to size.
320151,0,"A ballet shoe is a ballet shoe is a ballet shoe. Plain and simple. But they need to be worn a while to conform to your feet. If you have never tried them before, don't try to figure out which is the left and which is the right, they look just alike. I have a wide foot. Reviewers said these ran large, so I ordered my regular size... figuring they would stretch to make the right width, and at the same time get a little shorter. But, they hurt right away since they were too long and narrow. I didn't want to suffer while breaking them in. Fortunately my husband remembered we had a shoe stretcher, so I put that on them, one at a time for a few hours. Now they are a comfortable width and length, and I'm sure they will soon conform completely to my foot."
139103,0,Wore twice got wet now sole coming loose. Glue did not hold up like it should have very disappointed in it
115570,1,Have been pleased with these boots 2nd pair I have bought. Great water proof and very comfortable soles. I like that the laces don't break easy because of they have eyelets all the way to the top.
344242,1,"Este producto cumple con mis espectativas,lo recomiendo a los futuros compradores, es por esto que mi calificacion a sido la maxima. Comprar por medio de Amazon es seguro y puntual..."
84252,1,"I have been looking for a replacement pair of these shoes for ages. As a nurse I need something light and comfortable and these do the trick. The only negative I can say, for some reason, they hold onto smell. I have never had shoes that do that before!"
31842,0,"When these shoes arrived, I was pleased to see they were as cute as they looked online. They also lived up to my expectations in terms of comfort. They hurt like heck! They look like they would hurt, and I knew that going in. But I wanted them anyway. And I am keeping them. Even if I can only wear them for a couple hours at a time. I wore them to a wedding and to the reception that followed. Probably 3 hours into the wearing, I had to hobble back to my hotel room while leaning on my husband's arm to change to some comfy slides.They made my legs look great and I received several compliments on them. They are also very well made and appear to be high quality. I am eager to see how they hold up. I am thinking they will last me quite a while since I am so limited to how long I can stand to wear them. I will post an update if I find that they break in nice and become more comfortable."
350286,1,"Very lightweight, confortable and keep my feet cool. I highly recommend these sneakers. They may seem priced high, but they are worth the money."
53275,1,i love my sneakers. i have to say that one of the things i like is i can wash them and i have never had the problem of the front of the insole coming apart
75044,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
107336,1,Comfortable shoe and cute. Had to stretch as was a bit too tight but perfect now.
315455,0,I like these but I bought the 8 1/2 wide and they are a little too short - but I still wear them. I will buy more grasshoppers in future but will get them in a 9 wide. I haven't worn them enough to be able to tell if they will wash easy but I expect them to.
134626,1,"Eastland Newports are good strong leather shoes. I am a teacher and I walk around my classroom a lot during any given day. My Eastland Newports are very comfortable and roomy; therefore, my feet don't hurt at the end of the day! The wide width, coupled with the fact they go with almost any pant outfit from khakis to jeans, make the Eastland Newports my choice of casual shoe!"
385199,1,"I first bought this shoe because it was on sale, wow loved it so much so that, ever since all my shoes are Clarks. Best in comfort."
325584,1,I bought these as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine. We both wear the same size shoes so when they came in i immediately tried them on and they were very tight. I ordered a 7 and had to return them for an 8 and i'm still witing for them to be returned. As far as the product i do not know for sure because i sent them right back but they seemed to be of good quality. So i rate it at 4 stars for the sizing issue.
307934,1,"Don't know how many pairs ive owned over the years but I keep buying more. Comfy, stylish and cool to boot. I'd give a 5 but i wish they werent as expensive..."
385052,1,Comfy.........I like the idea that it is made from recycled yoga mats. I wear a size 8.5. I was not sure whether to order up or down. I choose to order up.....the size 9 fits just right.
172482,2,"I've owned 3 pair of these shoes. Comfort is great, good support, roomy toe box and easy to get on and off. But the soles and heel crack and split long before the leather uppers show wear. The inside lining material wears and becomes shabby quickly. I would pay twice the price for better quality for a longer wear. The design is great but the material inside and the sole/heel is inferior. I'd buy again IF the price reflects the material quality."
359287,1,"These are my new favorite shoes. They are extremely comfortable and light. I tried a more expensive pair on in the store and found I needed to go up a size. So I ordered these one size bigger too. Glad I did, they fit perfectly. I would definately recommend these for anyone who is on their feet a lot."
295476,0,"IN SHORT: Worked well but didn't last long.IN DETAIL: These are fantastic for freezing rain, light icing and the like. Other people will slide all over the place while you walk normally. I did have issues when hiking on thick densely packed ice where even the Yaktrax slid so much I had to turn back. Lastly and most IMPORTANTLY, they only lasted about 30mi total use after which when the rubber on the bottom broken midway through a hike. Unfortunately the warranty is only good for 3 months so I would strongly recommend a different style that has only metal in contact with the ground."
349741,1,"I love these sandals. They are very comfortable, the color is nice, I wear them all the time. And they were reasonably priced."
308446,1,"I am on my seventh pair of Copa Mundials and I continue to be impressed. When you have a winning combination of looks, feel, and performance, you have no reason to change what you're doing. Just be sure to buy a size and a half smaller than your normal sneaker size, as the kangaroo leather stretches to conform to your feet. Also, do no expect to get more than one season out of the shoes, unless you have a lot of duct tape handy!"
43511,0,"My husband was not thrilled with these slippers, because his foot slid sideways when he walked in them. However, he wore them out, so I guess they were okay."
246083,1,This was an excellent product for the price. Very comfortable and very classy looking! The color is very rich and you can wear them with any color. True fit to size!
232474,1,I've worn Enzo's Liberty Loafers for many years and I LOVE them. When these shoes arrived I slipped them on and felt comfortable right away. There was no need to break them in or use a shoe stretcher to get them to fit just right.
38271,1,"Searched over several sites for all kinds of ""oxford"" type boots and these fit the ticket. Pretty much as pictured and described. Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the material is thin especially around the toe cap but, all in all a very nice boot."
307780,1,"This company was excellent to deal with. When we received the shoes, they didn't fit properly. Exchanging them was a breeze and another size was promptly sent to us at no extra charge to us. Very efficient."
264448,1,"Bought these for my son who wears a size 10 street shoe and was concerned ordering two sizes smaller, as directed in the product description, they wouldn't fit. They did, and the Capezio brand I grew up with has held up nicely compared to a Brazilian brand I bought for my daughter on ebay that started cracking the second week she wore them. Ordering direct from Amazon, not a smaller operation, was the way to go. I learned my lesson for the future.Buy with confidence."
296013,1,"We've strung together a number of rather harsh winters of late. Plenty of snow and that occassional Arctic blast from Canada makes for difficult to negotiate sidewalks and driveways. The Yaktrax makes that problem go away.The device is straight forward and easy to install on your favorite winter footwear. Just stretch it across the sole, and secure the velcro strap on top and your ready to go. And they work! I've used mine a minimum of twenty times. The traction that they provide is superb, no matter the substrate or condition. Ice on asphalt, no problem. Snow on concrete, child's play.In addition to being effective, they are comfortable. Infact, you scarcely notice that they are installed. I've read that the traction providing wire will eventually fail, so I'm witholding the five star rating. All in all, I'm very impressed."
85630,1,I was very impressed with these polo shoes. My son loves them and now his best friend wants a pair. The price was great. I could not have asked for anything more.
41237,1,"They're actually my only flip-flops. They are simple, low profile, not clunky looking, and have enough support to be comfy. Very comfy, cute with dresses ans skirts, and in black, of course they go with everything. I've worn them to the beach, on short hikes, gotten them dusty, dirty, and wet, in both salt and freshwater. They hold up nicely -they're really well made."
265709,0,I ordered thise for my son for Christmas. He usually wears a 13 but would have needed a 12 in these. He didn't really like them for hiking; they are more of a work boot. You can't just ship these back to amazon; you have to pay to do it.
296731,1,This is the third pair of Clarks Desert Trek Boot I purchased. Love this boot. Comfortable and rugged. I say buy and pair and be as pleased as I have been.
202219,0,"I own a children size 5 of this boots so I figured Women size 6 will be a perfect, however the boots barely fit which makes me wonder how could the smaller kid size fits better than the adult size?"
44444,1,One of the best walking shoes I have owned. Good support and cushioning. Plenty of toe room and easy to put on and off.
108064,1,"This SoftSpots Annie Lo shoe is one that I have worn before. They are wonderful shoes, comfortable for my picky toes and very easy to wear. They cost about what I expected to pay for good shoes but I would love to know when they are on sale so that I could buy a beige and brown pair also and save some money. I really prefer purchasing shoes at a store with a shoe expert but I am really happy with these shoes for dressy everyday wear."
71644,1,"These shoes have been cool kid shoes since the nineties. Sure, the company strategically targeted the youth market back then, but that's why Vans became cool too, and Converse, and all the other brands that people think makes them counter-culture. It's a gimmick, but if the product is good, why not increase market share?Bottom line: they are affordable, comfortable, and the color schemes rock!"
99188,0,"For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration."
275983,1,I looked all over for these shoes found them at a great price and love them so much and will buy another pair very soon as these ones are almost destroyed
166449,1,"I have searched for a handbag like this for months (literally). My everyday handbag by another top name lasted 10 years and I bought that one for $150.00. I can't believe I found the same qualities...buttery soft, easy to organize and find things quickly. The adjustable straps can go cross body or shorter, and not bulky. This is well worth the price. Go for it ladies."
29536,1,Theyre called classic for a reason. Probably my favorite shoe ever made.Need more be said?
224523,1,"From the past to the present Converses have always been in style. These classic shoes are all over America today. Why are they so popular? Probably because they've stayed the same over the years. Any type of person can wear these trendy shoes, and a good thing is, they last incredibly long. I recommend these shoes to babies all the way up to adults!"
273909,0,I love these boots and bought them to be my comfy every day boots. But while the foot of these boots fit great the legs didn't fit the calf shaping started 1&#34; lower than my own and cut in so badly at the top it hurt( even with the elastic built in). I spend $40 to get them stretched twice before I could even get them zipped comfortably!! So sad designers need to realize the bigger the foot the longer the leg... so on
265032,1,"Let me start by saying that this is a real user review!! I bought this same pair of shoes at a local store $10 cheaper thanks to a store $10 coupon! I don't go by first impressions as most users do, but rather by making an educated judgement of anything I buy these days til I try it out first! having said that looks doesn't matter to me as much as comfort, quality of material, and how well something will last.If I were to review this shoes during the break in period, I would have given it one star! the trial break in period for this pair of hiking boots during the first six weeks was very disappointing and very painful to say the least; as the heel broke through my skin, leaving me with two bleeding blisters. I had to stop wearing them for a week until the wounds healed. But since I loved the simple not over the top look of this shoes, so I decided to give it another try at wearing them. I particularly love the hooks to tight up the shoe laces!! I also felt the shoes looked well built and seem like it would last.Well it has been three months since, and must admit that I love them! they feel very comfortable, very supportive for those of us with medium to high arch, and the quality of this pair of hiking boots seem to hold up exceptionally well for someone who does an average of 40 miles of hiking per week. The bottom outsole of these shoes has not worn out one bit; as it still looks as good as new as when I first bought them. Since my feet grows about half a size every couple of years I intend to buy another pair soon! WORTH EVERY PENNY!! My new favorite kind of footwear. I even wear them to work in suit and tie!!"
185585,1,"Actually, in error, I ordered a size too small and could not wear them. Did try exchanging them for my size but they did not have the shoes available in that. So actually I never got to enjoy them."
300117,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
128204,1,"The price was right but the boots are a little large and very high. Makes me feel like I am tipping over. I am a fan of Nine West and own other pairs so I ordered my usual size 7 so I am surprised that they are too big. The neck of the boot(ie) is large, It looks smaller in the picture and even though they should go under pants, it will look funny on thin calves. Also, the heel inside the shoe is very wide and does not fit snugly around your foot-- so your heel swims around. In addition, the leather is thin. I have other Nine West boots and the leather is more substantial. These are just for dressy wear and would last only one season and would not be great in rain or snow. This is my lst shoe purchase over the web. My 5 star rating is for the beauty of Nine West shoes. Even tho I am disappointed in the Ealene boot, Nine West shoes are great shoes."
284652,1,"Bought for my wife for trip to FL. Got the single stack, narrow strap and she loves them. Cheers!"
338556,1,"The purchase took place as expected in estimasdo time, and with respect to the product announcement being sold agrees with what is expected without any complications or problems arise"
256018,1,"I have five pair of these slip ons. They are great, comfortable and easy to put on. Highly recommened for a comfortable summmer shoe OR all year."
178837,0,i think that this sneaker was a bit tight but otherwise a good buy. waiting to procure a similar item.
100146,1,"I am very pleased by how quickly the shoes came--it only took 2 days! I ordered the Sahara colored (leather) sperry's for my sister. And I'm very glad that I ordered 1/2 a size lower than her normal shoe size (as suggested by other sperry customers) because they have stretched out a bit. She said that when she first put them on, they were not as comfortable as she thought they would be. She did not get any blisters, but the heels of the shoe were definately uncomfortable for her. HOWEVER, since she has been wearing them everyday for almost two weeks,the heel stretched out and she says they feel great!"
295809,1,"I really appreciate my yaktrax - the sidewalks around here have seldom been clear of snow and ice this winter, and the yaktrax have meant that I have been able to continue my daily walks."
273786,1,"These rubber boots fit perfectly-I wear a men's 10 1/2 so I ordered an 11 (whole sizes only) which was perfect. The boots seem a little heavy and clunkish, but that's the nature of rubber boots. I new I could find a good pair of rubber boots for a reasonable price, and I did. I think I found a really good deal!"
339179,1,"I had my first pair of Converse All-stars in high school in the early 1960's. That was before they were known as ""Chucks."" They were, and still are, the best basketball sneakers around. They're good for everyday workouts and just hanging around the house. Comfortable, inexpensive and they last just about forever."
362192,1,"I have had my new Easy Spirit shoes for about 2 weeks. I love the fit and comfort of the shoes. I walk daily at least 2- 3 times and day, and I was looking for shoes that would give me the support I need, and were at the same time comfortable. I was leery about ordering shoes online because I usually like to try them on. But I took a chance, ordered my regular size, and the fit is perfect. If you are looking for a stylish and comfortable shoe that is good for walking, I think these shoes would be a good buy."
36563,1,"I got these for my daughter for her work shoes, she loves them. They hold up nicely, she works for Donatos and they have held up nice."
233974,1,A well built shoe for walking around or working out. I like that it does not have lots of goofy colors or textures like sports shoes have now a days. I've bought them before and will buy them again.
302162,1,Fuer alle die auch ein bischen deutsch koennen.Der Service von dieser Firma ist schnell und perfect.Our next pair of Chucks we will get from this companie again
307403,2,"These shoes are terrible and i totally hate them. I had originally ordered a pair of Easy Spirit Gofast which i loved but had to return because of sizing. As the Jumper was the only shoe available in a half size at the time i went with them even though i wasn't thrilled with the style.The style though bad, is not why i dislike these so much. These are marketed as a walking shoe. I tested the walkability at the flower show and halfway through the show my feet were hurting. I don't know why they call these walking shoes. I felt like Frankenstein's monster in these shoes.They are so big and clunky and heavy and stiff. No ventilation, no flexibility they aren't good for walking let alone working out. And your feet will be so hot.I've had these for a while a now but shortly into wearing them the man made material started peeling off. I feel like an old woman in these shoes!"
9700,0,"not bad, looks a little plain though."
43357,1,"Love the Asics brand, but should of purchased the gel opposed to the Gt-2110....I switch this pair w/my other running shoe; Nike....prefer the Asics brand, but my mistake not purchasing a more substantial running shoe.......but, still a great shoe!"
384478,1,"I've had a great experience with this brand and these super cute boots don't disappoint. I was looking for this style to add to my wardrobe but purchased these for the look. Although this style can be a little too masculine for me, the beautiful soft gray and pink color combination makes them a fashinable comination of sporty andladylike."
14484,1,"I really like Adidas and I have probably bought 20 pairs or more for me and my family on Amazon. Amazon has great prices on these and when they are on sale, well that's unbeatable!"
282726,1,I got these for my granddaughter along with a native American dress. She just loves wearing them both. The quality of these boots is excellent and I reccommend them for imaginative play or for practical use.
239228,1,"Well worth the money. Now I can throw batting practice to my team without falling down when I tryto throw hard. Quality shoe, great price, fast shipping."
118365,1,"I don't care what Capezio's sizing chart says...these are not true to size. I took my daughter to the shoe store to get her exact size before ordering. She is a 13.5. I ordered a 1.5 and her toes were at the end. So we ended up with a 2,which is just right. They are very cute and seem to be well-made. This is my daughter's first pair of ballet shoes and she loves them. The price on Amazon is reasonable."
288123,1,I've had Birkenstocks before so I know what the shoe is. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived four days after being ordered. I will use this company again.
360444,1,"High quality shoe--more than expected. Fit perfectly and very comfortable. Purchased as an Easter shoe, and beautiful! Will wear for a long while."
71317,1,i bought this sandals and was very happy when i recieved it in the mail. it was one of the best buys i made this summer.the sandals looks good and is super comfortable.
359795,1,fast delivery and brand new! in box and should order in 1/2 size bigger im a 7 so 7 1/2 fit just great
146128,0,"I have a pair of UGGS that are over 16 years old. They were made in New Zealand and of higher quality. Now UGGS are made in China and it shows/feels. After verifying authenticity and trying on my boots...they feel so flimsy, but what can one do?My old pair finally started to wear out on the inside behind the heel. They are still ok with a double pair of socks, but I wanted a taller pair of boots. The toes on my old boots are reinforced with another strip of suede. It feels really strange putting on my new ones as they don't have that reinforcement and feels like it will wear out over time in the toes.Hopefully I will be proved wrong."
260966,1,"I bought these shoes for my daughter a few months ago because we could not find them at the store. It was well worth the risk of buying them the wrong size because they are exactly what she was looking for. They don't look cheap, they're not noticeably dirty even when they are, and for a girl mostly importantly, is that they match just about any outfit. We can't find anything negative to say about these shoes."
67454,1,"OMG.....love these boots, So comfortable, perfect fit,and the color..WOWeverybody(thats into boots) comments on these, I should buy another pairand just look at them in the box,Im not into boots as a fashion statement.But I really loves these bootsTHANK YOU.Timberland Women's Premium Nellie Ankle Boot"
161829,1,"I ordered these for my granddaughter's birthday. They were shippped promptly, and I was able to track them very efficiently. They were exactly what we wanted!!! They are very attractive and wear well."
236297,1,"So glad that K-Swiss continues to make this shoe ... and very glad that it was being offered at a reasonable price.For me, this is the Pirelli tire of tennis shoes and they have saved my footing more than once!Great materials ... solid footbed .... comfortable on and off the court ... and the traction!!I've worn through a half a dozen pair over the years and that takes some real effort!allen"
138050,1,"I am always a size 6 in footwear, but get a 6.5 for sneakers (Converse, Vans). I bought the navy Keds in size 6(M), medium width, and it's a little too narrow. However, going up to 6.5 would result in the shoes being too long. I won't be able to wear these without socks in the summer, so I'm going to invest in a pair of insoles when summer comes. I agree with previous reviewers that these shoes run narrow and long. After having them on my feet for some time with thin socks, they have stretched slightly in width. The quality is pretty good, comparable to canvas Converse and Vans. I bought Keds to wear around on campus since I wanted something less bulky than Converse All-stars and a bit more feminine than Vans Lo Pros. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase and might buy another pair in the future."
38850,1,"As always, these are great shoes. I keep them in my shopping cart all the time. When my son starts getting close to needing another pair I start watching the price. When the price comes down I order a pair or two. The service has always been great. No complaints."
253486,1,Receiver??? You are denied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Adidas plus talented corner back equals devistating defense and victory against any offense!! Adidas is Victory!!
56177,1,Anyone that wear Keds knows that they are great shoes. Got these for my wife and she likes them. Great looking shoes that offer solid support for you feet.
108610,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
137189,1,"Love these converse shoes.They are a great shade of red, have already got a lot of comments on them.Thanks Chuck!"
367753,0,"The black version of the Itasca SeaRay Slides arrived on time and in a box. They fit and are moderately comfortable. For the $30 or so shipped, they are about what i would expect. But, these are not some deeply discounted irregulars or end of line, though they may actually be. The are worth the $24.99. The smell of rubber was dominant when i opened up the box. there is no more than a flat piece of thin material separating the rubber from the removable insert. They are light and do fit comfortably but do not , by any means compare to the other higher line mocs that happen to go on some drastic sale and if i am lucky enough to find my size at the same time they go on sale-once every 3years. maybe. So, these seemed to be ok out of the box. i am wearing them and went for a walk without them breaking down and without getting any blisters. They do have a nice back for the achilles tendon and some foam in it with a center portion cut down for easier entry and removal, not much support but a nicer addition. there are elastic gores on each side with very little stretch to them but fine. my size was on target.the only real issue was that these were no way first quality or regular. there are glue spots all over the toe and fronts of both shoes. not little ones but sizable and 4 on one shoe and a couple on the other. they do not come off. At first , i thought it was only dust from shipping or a shelf storage. only it didnt come off with a light brushing nor with some water on a cloth. For me, it isnt a big deal because i always spill something i am cooking on my new shoes the first time i wear them anyway. I cant help it, always have, I used to cook for a living and now for amusement so am used to having a couple of oil spots on everything. Some people might be put off by the glue drips. I dont really mind but would normally want to be the one who gets the first spots or stains on my shoes (or shirts) thinking that this time I will keep them in perfect shape for more than a day.For the price i paid ,no problem, had i paid the 'full price' listed on the screen of $60, i would have returned them today-the day i got them."
374312,1,"If I buy this pair from Amazon, it will be my 9th identical pair of this shoe. I was working in a prosthetic and orthotic lab and found these to be the most comfortable shoes out there for the money."
222228,2,"I bought these for my father for Christmas in his normal size, but they were too small. If you purchase these, make sure you order a size larger."
281965,1,"product was best priced, received in no time, it was a gift and the person receiving the product has no problems with it"
131326,1,"The boots arrived before expected, which was good. The boots fit very good and I wear them almost every day.Couldn't have a better pair."
93725,1,"Have only had these boots for about a week but have been wearing them everyday. I do about 4 or 5 miles per day walking in the woods and know I should wear hiking boots, but I decided to wear these for 1 day to break them in and then go back to my sneakers or hiking shoes. I was willing to suffer 1 day to break these in. That was last week and I've been wearing them everyday since then. No break-in period for me..they've been very comfortable. I did put thin foot insoles in but I do that with all of my footwear before I put them on...so I'm not sure how they would be without them. I'm guessing they would be OK. It has rained a few days here and so far they are definitely waterproof. These boots also look good for riding my motorcycle. I got the charcoal color and they are sharp looking. I'm going to buy another pair over the Winter in another color since I'm so happy with these. I highly recommend these boots."
121148,1,Feel like I 40 yrs. younger. For a causal shoe for Santa these are Great. I really enjoy them feels great to be able to wear a really well made shoe. Thanks ConverseSANTA GARY
42598,1,"I was pleased with the price and the quick delivery of my shoes. Timberland stores are becoming harder to find, but I love the quality of these shoes. They are totally water proof, so I can walk the dogs in the morning in the wet grass and still have dry socks for the rest fo the day."
207234,1,"I am a bit of a shoe freak so I have lots and lots of different brands and styles. Let me tell you these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever put on my feet. I was telling my friends that they feel custom made and light as a feather. I got them because they were on sale, they looked decent but not my favorite, once I got them and tried them on they went straight to the top of my list. I'm going to order another pair to put up and another pair in brown. LOVE THEM!!!"
127748,1,"Those slippers are super cute. I bought the pink hippos for my 18 months daughter. They are a little bit difficult to put on (sometimes you have to pull on the tag at the back to really get them on those little feet), but then that means that kids can't take them off that easily.My daughter is a size 4W and the medium fits her well. I wish they had bigger sizes as she's about to outgrow them.They seem to be very comfortable, the rubber soles are great on wooden floors."
64700,1,"Just bought several NEW Keds in White, Black, Navy, Bright Blue and Red to replace the OLD Keds that I bought 20 years ago! And my ""old"" Keds are still for perfect for yard shoes, knock around shoes etc! My new Keds in White and Black are of leather and how comfortable and easy care they are! The Bright Blue, Red and Navy Blue are canvas and washable. All are just wonderful and looking forward to another 20 years service. Since I was a kid, I have lived in Keds sneakers for the comfort, looks and the fact that they last and last and last. They are all worth every penny that I paid for them. Thanks Keds, hope you never change!"
355791,0,I purchased these to supplement some others I had my students wearing. I have had to repair the buckles every time hey have been worn.
82458,1,"These are just gorgeous, and very comfortable too! Highly recommended. Only slight caution is that they run a bit small and narrow; I wear a sz. 8 in open-toed shoes (and a sz. 8.5-9 in closed shoes and boots) and these fit just right, but if you have wider feet, order a 1/2 size up.I got these in the gold color for my wedding, and they were PERFECT! Felt like walking on pillows, and I was on my feet pretty much the whole wedding day, so comfort was crucial."
175900,1,This is a beautiful pair of shoes that look great and are very comfortable as well! Great price too!
75912,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
320843,1,"Update 6/2012I've had these almost 2 years now and wear the heck out of them! They're still going strong! I had a very small problem which was my fault for not using the pull up straps where a thread pulled loose. Before this very small problem turned into a large one, I took it to the shoemaker where he re-sewed the 3/4 inch long problem by hand for a nominal charge of $10. He commented on what an excellent pair of boots these were and also commented on their suppleness and asked what conditioner I used on them saying 'Keep doing what you're doing and these boots last forever'. I told him I was using Frye Leather Conditioning Cream which is a bit of a chore on large boots andFRYE Weatherproof Spraywhich is quick and easy. Being that they have the 'Vintage' finish, you can't use any polish. Those 'Neutral' can change the texture of the finish and detract from the boots good looks. From the start I wanted these boots which are quite expensive (but Made in USA) to last. I called Frye and asked what to use on them. They mentioned several products but promised that theirs would definitely work as intended on the Vintage finish. I highly Fye products on these boots. The soles and heels are wearing like iron and it will be a LONG tome until I need new soles but I was concerned as to who can I take these to when I need soles without worrying that they'll mess something up. You can return them to Frye for any repairs for the same price as local shoemakers.Update 11/2011I've had these over a year now! These are by far the BEST and MOST COMFORTABLE boots I've ever owned.. Now read on to see my original Sept. 2010 review...I bought this pair (Tan/Vintage) after reading reviews all over the Internet. They were ALL 5 STAR! I'm not about to change that either. These boots look fantastic! I liked them in the pictures, but when you see them in person there's a real WOW factor!I took them out of the box, put them on and off a few times to loosen them up and went out and about. They were so comfortable that I couldn't believe they were new! They felt broken in already.The quality of the leather, finish, construction, stitching, components and workmanship are EXCELLENT. An even better thing is that FRYE makes them right here in the USA. These are quality boots. I'll review them again... maybe in 10 years or so, as these are built for a lifetime of everyday use.Since you're reading this, I know you're thinking about buying a pair. Don't settle for second best and wish you had bought these (When your cheaply made overseas ones fall apart). Pay a bit more and and get the best! FRYE Men's Harness 12 R Vintage Boot!"
190931,1,This is the only sandal I can wear without hurting my feet. I can wear these sandals right out of the box on an all day shopping spree and my feet are fine! I wear a D width and these are truly the best fit for wide width feet. I have them in every color!
24343,1,"I like the color in this shoe, though I have another pair that's a more natural color. The fit is fine, even though I have a slight problem with one of my feet. These shoes work well with my summer clothing, which is mostly casual."
360338,1,These shoes are Absolutely amazing. The shipping was very quick and they arrived just as described. The shoes are very comfortable so they don't need broken in. They are great quality and i would advise everyone to buy this brand of character shoes. and the best part is that they go with anything!
90623,1,I love these sneakers. They are the only ones I wear. I have hammer toes and the soft nylon top is extremely comfortable
245263,1,These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned and are very durable as well. As I write this review I am ordering my third pair to replace the ones I have been wearing for the last 14+ months.The ONLY reason I am not giving them 5 stars is due to the quality of the laces. The laces that come with them simply do not last as long as I would like.Might not be the fault of the laces though - the shoes are so durable they might just be outlasting what most laces are capable of.
110628,1,"Your opponents will be dazzled not only with your ball handling skills, but also your fashion prowess when you put these babies on. Stay in shape off the field too when the jocks are trying to run you down, just because they're not secure enough in their masculinity. Simply fabulous."
296003,1,"I bought these before here in town and loved them. The pair I originally bought still are great. I needed a couple of pair to place strategically at work and in the car in the event of snow and I wasn't ready. Now I'm ready.These Yaktrax are great for those hard to see places. Is is just wet or is is ice? I don't have to worry if I have these on. They provide great grip and give me more confidence when walking.Warning! Don't wear them on tile or hard wood floor, you'll slip and fall! Not to mention possibily damage your floor."
341764,0,"When I first wore these, they were somewhat tight, but it wasn't long before they spread out. Also, they do not have an arch support. I will wear them around the house, but if I need to walk any distance, I will change to other walking shoes, even if it's to go to the store. I would not order these again."
284463,0,"Disappointing shoe, at least on my foot."
328606,1,"I love these shoes, not only are they comfortable, they are stylish. On top of all that, I got a great price for them."
166699,1,"Best boot I have ever owned.I am 60yrs old and have owned alot of boots,But none compare even close to these.Great sole for grouse hunting everywhere I hunt.Support is exellent for ankles.And they are made in the Good ole U.S.A......A+A+A+A+A+"
103053,1,"very good quality, made from leather, the price very good very competitive.i went to special ballet shoes but the cheaper price very far with your stuff.your very excellent shoes with good deal price.smile...."
332103,1,"These shoes are very comfortable I strongly recommend them, you can wear them with jeans, casual, or kind of formal clothes, the design is nice and dont need much cleaning."
23327,1,I boughy these sandals for both of my boys. They are more then just sandals. They are very comfortable and supportive. Would recomend the highly
125881,1,"I am a beginner runner and sneaker head. My shoes of choice were Nike and New Balance until I started running for the first time in my life. After a couple of weeks my arch area behind the ball of my foot began to hurt. After a couple of days of brisk walk sessions the pain also rolled up onto the top of my foot. At that point I decided to seek out the advice of a professional running shop. I found one locally ( www.bklynrunforyourlife.com ) which helped me with advice and recommended the ASICS GT 2120. Once I laced up the GT 2120 shoes I immediately felt the difference. This is an excellent stability running shoe which is light and just plain feels good. A great shoe for those with fallen arches as I do or require a stability/supportive shoe to run or walk in. I was able to run in these shoes after a few days of resting my injured foot and I felt great. These shoes helped me from giving up my first attempts at running to making me want to run more. Shoes make the difference and for me these certain did. ""Waddle on!"""
322650,0,It is pretty good in general but the colour in definitely not pink. It is like skin colour so it didn't match the Leotard and the skirt which I ordered for my little child from Capezio also.
76557,1,Fit is perfect and I was able to take them out of the box and walk around NYC without a blister or any discomfort whatsoever.
343239,0,"They were narrow, like European Shoes. Buy a wider width and a half-size larger. If you have a high instep, do not buy these. They are well made but not for me. I had no trouble returning them. The vendor was fine."
267805,1,"These are the best boots I have ever purchased, they are water proof and very comfortable... don't be afraid to buy these !"
42891,1,"I've owned many different Harness Boots from Fryes to Durangos and the guide gear boots match up to competition. I love my other boots but when it comes to a nice boot that I can use daily and feel comfortable in these guide gears are perfect for that job. Great Fit, Great Comfort and well-crafted!!! Would I buy again?... Certainly would!!! They're great for all occasions, work or play! Great harness boots at a great price!"
102521,1,Son states that these are one of the most comfortable pair of shoes he has ever worn - will be ordering more soon.
351002,1,"These truly are great boots. If you don't want zippers, these are about as easy as it gets to put on and take off with the metal ring eyelets. Very comfortable with exceptional build quality. The sizes are pretty close to what you expect. If anything, they are slightly on the generous side. Fine example of why a US made Danner is still a ""Danner"" through and through."
235609,1,"The shoe runs narrow. The inside label says both &#34;B&#34; and &#34;D&#34;, B is printed on top of a line and D is printed underneath. I don't know what that means, I ordered D width, but they seem to be a B width by appearance. HOWEVER, they are very comfortable anyway on my wide feet! They are well-made and quite attractive, I can wear them with nice dresses/skirts. I am going to order more."
145500,1,"I was worried they wouldn't go with anything, but they are surprisingly easy to match with. They're so warm and super comfortable. I'm very happy with these."
200021,1,"Let's start with, I really have problems with my feet, thus finding shoes that don't hurt, is difficult. I read a lot of reviews before I bought these. It's a nice shoe, runs wide enough. My main problem is in the instep. I have a high instep, not incredibly high, but on the high side and these are tight. The laces are fake; you can't open the laces up to put the shoe on. The tongue comes way up; so there isn't a lot of room to get your foot in; so if you have a high instep, think about these, maybe try to find other reviews and see if anyone else has had any problems. They have a little give, but not much. Everyone loves them, maybe it's just me, but not my favorites. I think if I could actually open them like a regular tennis shoe, I would like them more. Great arch support, width is good for me, which means if you have narrow feet, steer clear. Come in fabulous colors, which I didn't get. If you are looking and only find drab colors, keep searching as the new colors are great and there are a lot!!!"
169207,1,"I love love love these shoes!! Not only are they extremely comfortable, but they're super cute. My shoes size range from 7- 7.5 sometimes 8, I got these in a 7 1/2 in black, fits perfectly and goes with everything! I would DEFINITELY recommend these shoes to whomever likes to feel comfortable while looking good :) I already have two pairs and looking to buy more :)"
172077,0,"These were nicely made, handsome shoes but too short for my feet. Order up a size."
177374,1,"Bought these for him and he enjoyed them. Very flexible and easy on your feet. I own a pair of these myself, and although the sole can get scuffed very easily, it's still a great shoe in regards to running or when you need black shoes for your outfit. Runs a half size bigger than usual so know your size before you order onlinel"
385589,1,"When I first saw Croc's I thought they were the ugliest shoe ever made. My fiance got a pair of Redskin Crocs and made me try them on to see how light they were. I put them on and they felt great! However, I still didn't want a pair because they were pretty darn ugly. I went to the Croc's website and saw the many different types they make and came across the mary janes. I'm a huge fan of mary jane shoes and these weren't as hidious as the regular ones. I ordered a pair from amazon in a basic black and now I can't go anywhere without them. They are perfect for shopping, going to the beach (much easier than walking in flip-flops), washing the car, etc. I have plantar fascitis and I can wear these shoes all day without my feet killing me. They are great for airplane trips because they are easy to slip off and on and are comfy for that rush to the gate. I'm no longer a skeptic and I plan on getting them in a few more colors."
323360,1,These shoes are really comfortable - so much so that I decided to stop wearing skateboard shoes altogether and just walk and skate in these.
262629,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
39616,1,"These are just the best flip flops ever... I usually buy a pair a year and wear them as much as I can, they are so cushy and comfortable!"
135741,0,"Got these in mango, very attractive, but a little tight, I plan to buy an insert to stretch them out a bit, comfortable other than tightness. Good height and detailing is beautiful."
73074,1,"I am not able to go barefoot because of some heel pain. I work in the kitchen a lot at home and this was causing pain in my feet. I looked into purchasing those gel mats for the kitchen but they are very expensive, someone suggested getting crocs as kitchen shoes! Perfect."
121242,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
52734,1,"I have to say that this shoes are more than beatiful, but what impressed me at all was the high quality of them and how comfortable they are for a girl. My daughter looks like a princess with them."
309749,1,This shoe is so comfortable and fashionable at the same time. The detail pattern on the shoe is beautiful and very well done. Someone anyways gives me a compliment when I wear these shoes.
221341,1,"Nice boots...however if you have thick calves, these will not go all the way up."
334492,1,good indoor shoes. stylish as well. These are volleyball shoes which have enhanced outsole rubber for improved tractino and flexibility.fitting is ok. they just run a little narrow. I would suggest to buy half size up and wide if possible.
61790,1,"For the money, I don't think you can buy a better hiking boot. In fact I think these boots are a great buy even at full list price. At least for my feet, Hi-Tec boots have always been long on comfort and durability. I've had these boots for several years and worn them for hiking, birding and general outdoor stuff. They're great for keeping your feet dry crossing streams or walking through wet grass. They require little if any break in. There's really nothing wrong with the laces that come with the boots, but for just a few bucks I prefer some good round boot laces on them. For me these are easier to tighten and have a more substantial feel."
43659,1,"I just re-purchase that shoes, around yr ago, i bought the white color speers, when I found out is discount item, I re-purchase another pair (Black/gold). That is a comfortable, cool shoes.Just for your information, I am working in HK. It's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here. I need to purchase online and ship to HK. (Takes 14 days). So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player. That is 100% good choice. (Try it... Very Good Deal)Excuse me! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes?"
350934,0,Not bad for the price. I guess I need to break them in as they are hurting my feet at this point.
182423,1,When ever I wear these boots people ask be to stick my leg out or turn around so they can see them. I wish I would have gotten them a size larger but they are a really great looking pair of boots
216094,0,"I am 7 and got 7.5, but it hurts my toes. nice quality shoes though, so I haven't decided if to return for a larger size of suffer with the discomort"
56286,1,"I love love love these shoes! I have wide feet, and sometimes it's hard to find shoes in wide or that flatter my feet, but these shoes are so perfect! I think I will buy a pair in every color now!"
355582,1,"I give this clog 4 out of 5 because the colors need to be restocked for the various sizes. They are priced right, free shipping, sizing was perfect but the color choices are getting slim...."
1467,1,"Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking BootEste producto fue comprado y cacelado junto con una cartera para caballero NAUTICA Men's Trifold Wallent y numca fue enviado, este comentario lo he enviado muchas veses pero no me han solucionado nada, no voy a rrepatir mas este mensaje, pero no realizare mas compras por esta pajina debido a lo que esta sicediendo."
63066,1,"Pros:Came BEFORE they said it was going to be deliveredQuality is greatCons:Beware of the size you get... I got the 8.5A and I didn't realized A meant narrow and when I say narrow, I mean VERY NARROW! Thank god my feet are very narrow or they would be too small!Great product overall! (:"
304625,1,I have been getting this same pair of shoes for 10 years now. I don't even play soccer. I just like the shoes.
30617,1,This is a great great large coin purse/wallet. It fits my money and lots of credit cards. I've used one of these for over 18 years and have never found a wallet that can fit everything with ease and is so easy to use. I also have to say this vendor was fabulous! I got my wallet within 3 days of ordering so I know they processed it as soon as they got my order. I'm so pleased I'm ordering more for Christmas gifts!
321970,1,"High quality boot. Looks amazing. Well constructed, solid.Best of all, I didn't have to break them in! I was dreading at least a minor heel blister. Nope.They aren't particularly comfortable to stand in for long periods, but what boot is?"
344449,1,"These boots are highly recommended. Pricey but you get made in the USA quality. These boots will last. My fit was 1/2 size smaller than regular boots. The boots have an excellent speed lace system and are waterproof and warm. They feel a bit heavy at first, but you get used to the solid feel of these boots. Has an agressive Vibram tread which won't let you down."
163269,1,"The product was the perfect color, soft leather and a nice heel height. My only problem was that it fit me too tight across the toes. I was sad to return it since it was being sold at such a great price but I have wide feet and would not be able to deal with that tiny problem after 4 hours in those pumps. Great shoe overall."
153339,1,"These are hands-down the most comfortable shoes on the market today! I can't normally do much walking because of the bunions I have and the neuroma in my right foot. However, I can walk for ages in these shoes! Plus, I can wash them and also take out the inner linings and wash them. I have sprayed Febreze on them, too. So, we have comfortable, washable shoes that don't look so ""dorky"" like many of the comfort shoes available. They come in a good selection of colors, too. I only wish they would produce some more with the same color soles as the shoe. Right now they are only dark-soled if you get the black. If only Easy Spirit would make some dressy flats that felt like these!!! I would give them 50 stars!"
239508,1,"The &#34;Khaki&#34; is actually green. An actual better color in my opinion. It looks a little dorky out of the box, but after the break in, it looks a lot better with a distinct FiveTen look.Again, the &#34;Khaki&#34; is actually green and it's a great color."
68495,1,This product was as advertized at a great price. It is hard to find wide shoes in a store. Great way to buy.
8309,1,these sneakers are perfect to use for an exercise class or at the gym. they are lightweight and very comfortable
317241,1,These shoes came to me and were way too tight. I have worn 9.5 4E size for years with no trouble--size had to be incorrect. I returned them at my expense of $10.00 so will not order shoes on line again!!
132555,0,"They run extremely small. Our granddaughter just got into a size 6, so I ordered a 6 1/2 and they weren't even close to fitting. Had to return and go with a 7 1/2. Other than that they are great."
197278,1,Converse chuck Taylor lo top awesome and extremely fast shipper fit perfect what more can one sat they are a classic
321725,1,"Choose a size down, and this shoe is perfect! I love it!! Especially nice for girls' casual wear. It's smooth and convenient."
269207,1,These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. The leather is soft and pliable. Buy these shoes!
62423,1,"I have no idea what everyone is talking about when they say that these are poor quality. They appear to be the same exact keds that you would buy in any store. I'm not sure if the other reviewers received a different shoe, or just aren't familiar with ked's. Also, the sizes are the same as normal ked's. I regret listening to the reviewers who said that they run small. I ordered a half a size up from what I normally wear, and they're too loose. I'll keep them anyway because they're so inexpensive, but I wish I hadn't listened. Probably unrelated, but I ordered these on friday at 8pm and chose one day shipping and they arrived saturday morning at 9:48. Excellent shipping."
344831,0,"I was a little more than disappointed to see ""Made In China"" in these boots (I was led to believe that Justin were all Made in the USA, and that's part of the reason I bought these). In that respect, the product info was misleading.Also; the felt lining in the heel area only lasted a few wearings before it tore and bunched up, so I can't walk very far without feeling like I've got a blister coming on. The black rubber sole just seems cheap, and they feel off-balance (compared to other boots that I own) when I'm walking in them.Overall, I'm disappointed with the manufacturing and quality, but will probably still keep them since I sit at a desk most of the time.If you're going to work or walk in these boots, I don't recommend them."
117145,0,The shoes were very nice looking and sturdy but not very comfortable and eventually unable to use them anymore for work purposes.
353460,1,I bought this boot for my 21 yr old son. His remarks are....This boot is comfortable and true to size. I like that they are water resistant too. Great buy!
310842,1,"I'd give them five stars but I think they're kind of ugly, not being a huge fan of the color orange. Using them for walking, about 5 miles a day, and so far they're holding up well and and are comfortable for the whole walk.Updating this review almost a year later: Still wearing these shoes, uppers still in good shape; still comfortable but about ready to be replaced, after holding up well for over 1000 miles! I'm going to try to replace them with the same shoe, I've liked them so well."
254481,1,"These shoes are great and have survived the wear & tear of my two year old son. I purchased the black color and was a little underwhelmed from a fashion perspective because the white shoe looks better then the black shoe. However, the shoe is very versatile because of the simple K-Swiss design and it is all black. I can pair them up with jeans and they go well with khakis. Also, the shoelaces do not easily come undone which should be standard for all toddler shoes, but I've purchased other pairs where the laces constantly come undone. The price was a good value for leather shoes."
202133,1,The boots are really warm and very well made. You can tell the difference between the stuff that is made in China and the high quality products like these boots that are crafted in the US
202362,1,This was a replacement for a worn-out pair of the same shoe. The new pair seems to be as good as ever.
60588,1,"Excellent hiking or everyday boot.Extremely good value and fit.Hardly any ""breakin"" required.I would definitely recommend these for anyone interested in a hard wearing boot,for the money."
293739,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
286960,1,So far I am very pleased with these less expensive versions of Birkenstocks. Haven't noticed any lack in quality and of course love the comfort of these shoes. Birkenstocks (and Betula's) are the best!
190393,1,"Steady-Eddie Tennis Shoe - Clean lines, white, neat. You can NEVER go wrong with this selection for a youth or an adult."
135105,1,This is a very good slipper shoe for inside and some outside wear. Is exceptionally warm and durable. Would purchase again.
376776,1,"This bag is awesome! I am so pleased that I ordered it. It is a great value for your money. Not only is it a hot looking bag due to the color combination, but its a great quality. The leather is nice and soft and so far has held up great. The more worn in it gets the better it looks. I have had many people stop me and compliment me on it. I'm glad I ordered it and would recommend it to anyone. Its nice an big and being that I am always on the go I can fit alot in it if necessary."
118458,0,This is not an all terrain shoe and should be used only for manicured grass and soft tracks.... but for those surfaces it is an excellent shoe
241138,1,"The shoe fit me well, and it came in the original condition - no damages, and it came on time."
74599,1,"very unique and cute shoes, bought 3 pairs, not great for rushing around town per say because the bottom of the shoe is a bit smaller than the top making it easier to fall if you run or walk to fast. but who cares when they are so cute and versitile. i wear them to work and play. my office is office casual."
151258,1,"These boots were outstanding. They handling everything from dirt, to dust, to knee deep mud... Highly recommended!"
345386,1,This shoe was true to size and a perfect shoe! The color is the best red! Can't go wrong with a Chuck Taylor!
286341,1,I ordered these shoes for a trip that I was taking. they worked out very well in the smokies.
226036,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
388476,1,"I do a lot of nature photography hiking and find myself frequently crossing ankle-deep streams to get a unique angle on a photo. These boots have kept my feet bone-dry, and incredibly warm. I look forward to using them for the upcoming winter months. They have thick padding, and are incredibly comfortable too.I would recommend these boots to anyone looking for good snow boots, or simply a pair of boots that will keep your feet dry."
8077,1,"Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes. Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes, so I was pleased. I do have hammer toes, and got a few red spots on top of my toes, but I don't know how I could have avoided that."
105644,0,"I bought this bag to tote my clothes and stuff to and from the gym. it's a great bag, but there isn't enough room to fit all of my stuff in it (work out clothes, shoes, shampoo/conditioner, soap, ipod and wallet).. so I ended up buying another bag which doesn't seem that much bigger, but is designed to fit more stuff in it."
242331,1,"If you're into the retro stuff, this really is a great pair of sneakers. People forget how comfy they wear and despite what your friends may think, they do actually still look pretty good with almost any jeans/combats. Whether it's the hi-tops or this nifty pair, you just can't go wrong for $30."
265988,1,"My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
322195,0,It is pretty good in general but the colour in definitely not pink. It is like skin colour so it didn't match the Leotard and the skirt which I ordered for my little child from Capezio also.
147232,1,"It was time to retire my old Ugg boots, so this time I decided to get a chestnut color pair. The color is beautiful and of course they are nice and comfortable. I just love them."
219043,1,Shoes arrived in pristine condition ahead of time. My kids' friends bought the exact same shoes from Bowling shop for more than double the price.I ordered 1 size bigger than the kids' regular size. It fits well.
310350,1,I bought these shoes for my daughter and she loves them. They were a very good price and I will probably buy more.
137562,1,The sneakers arrived timely. I have loved Keds since I was a kid and it's nice to be able to get them so easily.
378666,1,"Great seller, Super fast shipping. These are a great pair of shoes. They just have to be broken in before they'll truly preform at their best."
51483,0,The style and fit are fantastic but........ my pair has an odor from day 1 that I just can't get rid of. I even get busted by my team members. I really do like these shoes though and would hope they all don't have the problem I am still experiencing. PS I'm sure I could have sent them back for a different pair.
108701,1,Comfortable shoe and cute. Had to stretch as was a bit too tight but perfect now.
276693,1,First time using Amazon and my package cameRight away. Took about 5-10 business days andI have no complaints.
181717,1,"My son got the red/white/silver pair earlier this year, they are his ""spiderman"" sneakers (the red stripes look like webs to him). He loves them, they are great sneakers, and have held up well to his tough use. I paid $54 at the Stride Rite store, and when he eyed the silver/blue/green version while getting sandals he had to have them. $54 is a lot to pay for sneakers so I scoured the internet and quickly found them here for $16.89! Ok, you can't beat that. Great sneaker, awesome price, and they wash well for resell or hand-me-downs to younger brothers!"
132680,0,I thought these shoes would be perfect for a wedding...I think I expected them to be just little flats and not like a slipper. A little dissapointed.
349562,1,"I have been buying Van Eli Women's Frankie Flat for years! They are not only chic but also so-o-o comfortable - AND they are available in many NEUTRAL colors, which is especially handy when I travel (I don't have to pack lots of different shoes). I continue to buy replacements as my 'old ones' wear out!! I hope this style is never discontinued!!!!"
147632,1,"These are definitely the best Uggs to be created yet. I love my Uggs and currently have & pair, including my Bombers. I didn't buy them from here....but the review is still neccesary. Uggs never disappoint, and these are no exception. I love the leather on them the most, that's what drew me to them. Every winter I wear a pair of Uggs instead of snowboots and get mad every time. But I am not the only one! Over here in Boston, MA every girl you see is in a pair of Uggs, in ankle deep snow.....I know their toes are cold like mine because the fabric of the boots got wet and now is soaking through the sheepskin. LOL But we keep doing it. Well now I won't have that problem. I wore my Bombers out in the snow 3 times already and I am sooooo happy with them. I got home and my feet were till warm and toasty. Not to mention I don't have to wait for them to dry out to wear them again. Yay!!Oh, and for all the people who have never worn Uggs before.....They run big. I am a size 9/10 in shoes...so I usually have to purchase an 8/9. Happy Shopping!Kisses and Good Luck!"
329451,0,COLOR WAS NOT WAS SHOWN. NO TIME TO RETURN THEM THOUGH WE HAD TO USE THEM
374655,1,We were unable to get these on my little one's feet. They could have been marked wrong but they are not the size mentioned. Love the shoes anyway!
216904,1,"I have been looking for a year for lowtop converse in red for my daughter. On the rare occasion that I found a pair, it was not the size I needed.I had no trouble locating them through Amazon. They arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and my daughter is thrilled. It was exactly what she wanted."
32805,0,"So the shoes are absolutely adorable, very comfortable and look great. But maybe I just don't know how to tie those shoe laces or something. They are a pain. I thought that since we don't wear dress shoes every day, it wouldn't be bad to have shoes with laces (most of our others are with velcro), but these are particularly a hassle...unfortunately."
188712,1,This is my second pair. The tops outlast the bottoms but they are good quality. I have a c width foot so they are good for me. Everyone likes different sneakers for fit and quality. These are made well and will last about a year of daily use. I am satified with them and will keep buying them. Rob
346060,1,the birxs are very comfy. i wear them everywhere! they are so comfortable like wearing nothing at all. very good for us diabetics and our foot problems!
29439,1,"I give these a 10 out of 5. Yeah, they're that good. I currently work as a nurse on a busy med-surg ortho floor and i have to say the nurse to pt ratio in balt***** sucks. When i worked med-surg oncology in PA i had 4 patients on night shift, and here i have 5-6 on dayshift. Oh, that means i can start with 6 patients, D/c 3 home and still get 3 new admissions so i end up with 6. And no, don't picture some old lady, cuz i'm very young, just fresh out of college so it's not like i've doing this for forever and getting tired of walking all day.Anyhoo, i'm not used to to working days and dealing with all the craziness. When i worked nights, i was able to sit and relax between 1-4am and i still went home in the morning with back ache and calves hurting cuz step down tele units can be a pain. I usually slept with my legs elevated on pillows cuz they hurt real bad. i got these skechers and the first night i wore them, i said ""WOW!!!"" i don't feel my feet hitting the ground.I decided to start dayshift wearing these cuz i knew i wasn't used to running around all day and now i can't go back to my easy spirits. These are so comfortable i can do i 16hr shift in them. I walk in these shoes from 6:45am when i leave my house and i don't get of till 7:30 though most of the time you never leave till 8pm. And i walk home comfortably in them. I picked them up when they wer 29 bucks and i wish i'd grabbed 3pairs instead of 1. or even 2pairs. Nevertheless, they are worth every single penny, so much so i'll pay 60 bucks for their comfort.If you are on your feet walking about for 12 or more hours, please get these and do your feet and yourself a big favor. Your feet will thank you.I love these shoes and i'll say the only shoes i have that can match up to their comfort is my merrell relay tour sneakers.Seriously, try them on and you will love them. Don't spend $140 on some shoe when you can get all the comfort and more in these sketchers. Honestly, till i go back to school again, i'm going to be wearing these only for work. They look great with scrubs, I don't like to wear the shoes i wear to work anywhere else cuz i think the hospital is dirty so i can't tell how they'll look with anything else but i'm sure they'll go with a nice pair of jeans. I've owned them since spring and they still feel comfortable despite all the 12hr shifts and overtime i've done in them.I really hope skechers don't stop making these.09/24/11: I was surprised to see i'd written a review for this and the date tells me it was back when i graduated (haha, i write better reviews now). Anyhoo, I'm back here to buy a new one. Oh, this will be my fourth purchase. I tried the shape-ups(for a few weeks) but they were actually making my feet hurt so i went back to these. Too bad amazon doesn't sell them anymore but i'm glad the independent merchants on here still do. I'm not sure what i'll do when skechers stop making these."
62932,1,"I got these for my daughter for her work shoes, she loves them. They hold up nicely, she works for Donatos and they have held up nice."
343369,0,Fast delivery - but my wife says the shoes are very poor quality.Worn once and tossed into the trash.Not the seller's fault however - so 5 stars to them and 1 to the mfg. thus 3 stars.
274721,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
221640,2,"These shoes are no longer being made in Italy but in India. The quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be. I have worn this same style of Bostonian (Marco) for several years, and was completely satisfied. This is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great, comfortable, well-constructed shoe. Return to having them made in Italy!"
206255,1,I strongly believe every child should have a pair of these. I buy them as gifts for everyone I know. And they last forever so what can be better. crocs are suoer durable and clean. I use a mr clean white pad and wipe them clean. Then its like new all over again!
367425,0,"I should have ordered this as a size 12 or 11 1/2 if available but I still likeed the shoe and still have them for around the house lounging around but not good for any strenuous sport because of snug because of size, not the shoe."
247167,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
286527,1,"When I First Wore it,It Felt Like It Was Weightless!It Was so comfortable that i bought a few more pairs....."
186153,1,Greatest Most durable boots I've ever purchased. I'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid. All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost. I'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting.
310203,1,"Converse All Star are made to feel comfortable, this kind of shoes is never out of fashion, with jeans or shorts, wit t-shirts or shirts, once you wear a pair you will wish to have all of them."
140758,0,"Son buenos ahora pense que podian ser como los SAS, si esa son las espectativas no los compres , ahora como zapato comun no estan mal"
35655,1,My luvly wife can never have too many pairs of shoes (Nine West at that):I guess like all ladies!Her feet looked really nice in these especially with a recent pedicure.
149626,1,"I bought these sandals for my husband and he loves them! I also have a pair for myself, and I have had them for 7 years and they are still in great condition!"
346462,1,just an FYI - these things wear a size smaller than what you normally wear (i.e. i wear a 9M and ordered an 8M that fit perfectly)
169798,0,"The slippers are a light pink and they already have one end of the elastic band that covers your feet sewn in. You have to sew the other end. Also, I'm a size 9 regular shoe and the size 9 slippers are a wee bit tight, but they work. I still recommend ordering a half size up. Also, they don't cover my heel very well. They go about half-way up and it feels weird to me compared to my other pair of leather ballet slippers that I have. But overall, they work. I'd give them a B-."
62104,1,"Went to Yellowstone in these boots. They were comfortable, waterproof and did well on the 328 steps to get down to lower falls."
310178,1,Very cute my husband is 67 but he still loves his converse allstars! Thanks!! Every thing is up to loving!

56542,1,"This great outdoor shoes, has a very price-quality relation. Are you loocking for a outdoor shoes ???. Look at that. Confortable and good price."
268096,1,"These shoes are unbelievable! My (very flat) feet feel far better after a day in these than a day in running sneakers with prescription orthotics. They're expensive, but well worth it."
326210,1,this product was well worth my time to find. the seller was quick to send out a quality product.
54385,1,I received these shoes quickly after my purchase and they fit the description and picture and were exactly what I wanted. They fit well and look great.
357888,1,"I literaly danced all night, and my feet never hurt. I followed the advice I found on-line; I got 1/2 size larger. I Love them; they are the best purchase I've made in years."
43332,1,This is my second pair of Asics and I just love these shoes. These weren't the more expensive pair I wanted by Asics but are great anyway. I have a bad knee and my feet need extra support. These shoes are comfy and true to size. Although I do think they could have maybe a little more support for my low arch. But for the price I think they are great.
158656,1,"I was fitted for a pair of these at a speciality running store and purchased them with a gift card for over $100. I jog/walked a marathon in these a few months ago and they were great--no blisters, no nothing. I would definately purchase these shoes again, especially at the prices offered by Amazon!!!!"
342834,0,"I purchased from the photo. was in a hurry that day. Glad they where the low ones he wanted. novelty item. My son wanted them , he is 30 yrs old. A fun item he used to have many years ago. the size recomendations was correct. 1/2 size smaller was just right.... Not the Hi Tops they state in the add."
60830,1,"I purchased these boots for the Northern Michigan winter. i had searched for women's boots, but I kept coming back to these. I first ordered a size 9W not knowing how the men's sizing converted to women's feet :) They were a bit big, so I just received the size 8.5 M. They fit perfectly! I like to go for long walks, so they had to be comfortable, warm and dry. These are awesome in all those areas. I put them on and went on a 4 mile hike to test them. No problems at all, they are more pliable than any other new boot I've ever had- meaning I didn't have to wait for breaking them in before I was off hiking. I like it when other review refer to size, so here's a recap on that: I normally take a women's 9.5 W, the men's 8.5 M (normal width) fit perfectly with 2 pairs gym socks and a thin pair of wool socks. I'd say all those socks would be similar to one pair of really thick wool socks. Will be recommending these to friends."
14809,1,"I have a foot that is wide in the front and narrow in the back. These Danner's in EE are PERFECT with a pair of good heavy wool socks. They're light as anything and great to walk in from the very start. As they are not re-solable they may not be great for heavy users, but for the few times a year that I'll use them the certainly do the trick. I plan on buying another insulated pair in 1000 gram thinsulate for cold weather. I highly recommend these boots for hunting."
29470,1,This is my second pair and I hope they are never discontinued. Along with being stylish they are very convenient to slip on and off but still fit as well as any 'tie' sneaker.
340266,1,"After seeing the popularity of this shoe, I decided to test it out myself and I am impressed. Although its not too comfortable, they hug your feet and don't slip off even when loose, which is exactly what I was aiming for."
124894,2,"Despite the ""lugged outsole"" of this shoe, after having worn it on the wet streets of seattle, they are VERY slick on smooth concrete. BE CAREFUL!!!"
48445,1,"I buy this shoe every couple of years. I'm 6'1"" and these shoes offer great support.I buy 2E and these shoes fit perfectly. I tried for years with Nike and Adidas but they were too narrow.This is my third pair so I guess you can say I am a fan."
37307,1,"I purchased these for my 15 year old for Christmas, he is very rough on shoes but so far the shoes are standing up well. The black is a bit more 2 toned than the picture seems to show so the leather on the shoe is more of a dark brown than a black."
141768,1,"First off, these are not the original 1960 Dr. Martens 1460. Things change, get over it. What *can* you buy today that's exactly as it was 50 years ago?That said, these are still good boots. Yes, they're made in China or Thailand - so what? The Chinese and Thais don't know how to make good shoes? Some of the reviews I'm seeing here are borderline racist. Take it from someone who owns a Chinese, a Thai and a UK pair of Docs (two 1460's and one 1490) - yes, there are differences, but the Chinese and Thai boots don't lose in every category. In fact, they're more comfortable than the UK-made vintage line by about a factor of ten - I had to buy insoles for my UK 1460's or my feet felt like I was walking on rocks. The UK version may be a bit more durable, but then the UK version also costs about $80 more (listing for $200 now).The Chinese and Thai 1460's still look great, feel great and will last a good long time if you take care of them properly. (Yes, even the shoelaces last - I wear my Chinese 1460's every day and have for 18 months, and I'm on my first pair of laces.) Anyone who says otherwise has some other agenda."
92749,1,I was really very pleased to get this. I was nervous about the concept of using a shoe stretcher but was convinced when an adorable pair of nude wedges was just slightly too tight. I am so happy to say that this product worked wonderfully. It has stretched my shoes both width and length wise and the added pieces adjusted for corns and wider parts of my feet. It seems really well made and I am excited to use it again. It feels as though a whole new world of shoes has been opened to me with this product.
98226,0,"They came on time, though were a size smaller than I ordered. Luckily, I ordered them a bit big to start with, so it ended up working out ok."
316771,0,Returned this item. Color not as pictured but a bit darker. Not a bad shoe but too busy for me.
163958,0,"This shoe is okay, but not quite as comfortable as my Medley style or the AP1 style."
176962,1,"I've been playing soccer for my entire life and at last I've found a shoe that doesn't hurt my feet after a game.Very good traction , beatifull design and very original model.Thank you ADIDAS."
41380,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
3316,1,"Quality boot, it's just like the discription states, no surprises. Rugged enough for work and good looking enough to were out. Quality boot, would buy again."
271217,1,"the boots were nicer than expected, I was very happy with my purchase, until I tried them on and realized they were too big:(After I returned them, which was also a very simple process that went without a glitch, I realized I had paid 2/3 of the cost of the boots just in s & h. Therefore, I did not reorder. I still want the boots, but can't afford taking another chance on size problems-I will have paid more in s & h then the boots cost."
149408,1,"This is my third pair of Adidas Calissage. I still have and use the first pair, and threw the second pair out after the velcro quit on me. They are comfortable, fast and easy to put on and seem to clean up fine in the washing machine. Not sure if that's what killed the second pair, but the first pair has got to be at least ten years old and going strong. Hopefully this pair will last awhile too."
294405,1,"Well made, as advertised, very quick shipping, good price."
313943,1,"I received these shoes promptly, but sadly to say too wide for me. I wear a narrow and I ordered a narrow, but I really needed a slim, which they were out of. So this style of narrow runs wide. But this shoe is of great quality and the cream color is perfect. You can't go wrong with this shoe as far as the quality,..and the price is ridiculous. If you have very narrow feet, this shoe is probably not a wise choice for you as it wasn't for me. I rated it 4 b/c it's a little wide for a narrow. Good luck."
195696,0,They didn't have the color I wanted so I settled for a different color shoe.
133885,0,Just what I was looking for BUT I wear a 7.5 and have a high arch. They ran small on me and I had a really hard time getting them on. It's a shame because I liked the look....has to send them back
48931,1,"this is a good product, comfortable fit and looks great. it came on time and i didnt have to wait long with anticipation. it was well packaged..."
372409,1,I think this is a great thing for people to expeience and i hope u guys stay around for good
339912,1,The Chuck Taylor converse I ordered from AMAZON meet all my expectations.It is comfortable on my feet and i wear it everyday.
358236,0,"I got the black Women's size 7 tap shoes and they look nice. The heel was just the right height, but no taps included?! They weren't put on the shoes nor were they included in the box. This is weird. Now I notice that the photo in amazon featured just the shoes with no taps. I should've been more observant! Now I have to purchase the taps from a specialty dance store and go to a shoe repair shop to have the taps put on professionally. Beware."
343372,1,Very satisfied-very long wearing-comfortable shoe-have worn Grasshopper shoes-many styles the last three year-will continue buying them.
101563,1,My Mom has neuropathy in her feet and has a terrible problem with shoes. This shoe works very well for her. She wears a size 5WW which is very hard to find in shoe stores. I was able to get these on sale with Amazon's help. I couln't believe how quickly we received them... Great service....
61979,0,"I purchased these boots to have a better foot/ankle experience while hiking in the local mountains. They definitely helped my feet and ankles be more comfortable. The one down side has been the top of my toes keep getting rubbed raw while hiking. The first time I hiked in them I thought it was due to breaking in and maybe another pair of socks would help (I had on 1 pair of good hiking socks). So the next time I went out I wore 2 pairs of socks, but the same thing happened. I have now hiked many times (so boots are broken in) and I always have rubbed some toes raw. Not sure why, but I think it maybe there is too much distance between the boot and the top of my foot (I have normal size feet and have never had this happen before). So overall I like the boots, but they don't seem to like Me."
60388,1,"My first pair of Hi-Tec Altitude IVs lasted around 10 years. I used them for work and for casual wear, and even hiked into Montana mountains on an overnight pack trip several years ago. They wore very well, and so I bought a new pair last year. The new pair has higher ankle support and seems a little heavier than the first pair, but are comfortable and appear to be durable. I did notice some sewing differences and that the tongues on the new pair do not catch pant cuffs, so that's a bonus. I recommend."
231022,1,"These shoes are amazingly comfortable! Although I am not a nurse, a friend had recommended them for the sheer comfort and durability aspect. I work and live in NYC, where you are never standing still, not for a second, and have been looking for comfortable shoes that look good, professional, comfortable, good quality, and will not make me skip a meal so I could afford them. These shoes are it! Your feet will thank you. They are so light and EXTREMELY comfortable. I own two pairs in black, two different styles, both made by Nurse Mates. Theses are 10X better than Rockports or Clarks. Buy with confidence. You will not regret it."
189874,1,"I have been buying this shoes for my step son for over 3 years now. They are a classic shoe that hold up very well for boys. Great for school/ uniform shoes and true to size. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a stylish, affordable shoe for a boy."
175184,1,"This will be my third pair of Eastlunds over the years. Recommended by our daughter and have never been disappointed. My second pair however, wore out sooner than the first pair. I decided to try again and seeif the quality would be good.I have issues with my feet and before always needed specially made inserts (orthodics). Now I no longer need those which make it easier on the budget.I certainly do tell people about my satisfaction ."
252064,1,"I will never understand why Reebok discontinued the original BB4600 high tops--they were simply the best ever made. PERIOD. Hopefully, Reebok will start making them again soon. These high tops (especially the ones from the 1980s-early'90s) were far better than comparable shoes from Nike, Puma, Pony and Converse--not surprisingly, they go for impressive prices at online markets like Ebay."
296747,0,"ProsI like the style of the shoes. They look good with jeans and casual wear. I really like the darker brown leather on the back. It gives a pretty cool look on that portion of the shoe.ConsThey aren't as comfortable as I had hoped. There is virtually no arch support. The soles are pretty flat and do not provide really any sense of cushioning. If you like a feel of being in touch with the ground and not very cushy soles, you will like these. I read several reviews stating that these were the most comfortable shoes ever, etc. I certainly cannot agree with that. They can be a little difficult to get on and for me, they tend to wear (rub) on my heel. Of course I have only worn them a few times at this point, so I'm hoping that they will break in and be better. Also, I'm very glad that I read other reviews because several folks commented that the sizing runs a bit large. I agree. I normally wear 13 and I bought 12. With the size 12, I have plenty of room. This is not an issue, just something that anyone buying online needs to know.OverallThey are just ok. I really wanted to love them, but I haven't gotten there yet. These will probably be shoes that I wear because I like the look much more than because I like the feel.I hope this helps you in your decision to purchase."
125930,1,i bought a pair of black kennedy sandals last summer and they are one of my favorites. I like the design very much. They are comfortable to wear daily yet look dressy. They go well with a variety of outfits. I wear 7.5 in sandals and 8 in closed-toe shoes and got 7.5 of these and they fit great. Felt true to size and width.
389038,1,"My 12 year old son has extra wide feet, and these are the only wide soccer cleats we've been able to find under $100. They fit wonderfully and they look okay, but halfway through one season, the toes were ripped up from wear. We did not have this problem with any previous cleats he has worn, so I see this as a quality issue, but we bought the cleats again this season because they are the only wide cleats we can find. At least they are inexpensive. Since my son outgrows his shoes every season anyway, it's not a big deal that we had to purchase another pair, but for adults who are done growing, I'd suggest investing in the more expensive soccer cleats that are of better quality."
72761,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
360782,1,"I needed shoes for a burlesque dance class. Many people recommended capezio. These shoes are lightweight, comfortable and true to size. Highly recommended"
59050,1,"This is the 2nd pair of these same shoes I've purchased (from Amazon), and I love them! They fit just as expected, are lightweight, and have a really versatile color. Since they're a neutral color, I can wear them with both casual clothing and slightly nicer clothes like khakis with an untucked polo. I may even buy another pair in 3 or so years when this pair wears out!"
140760,0,"I was in search of a pair of riding boots that was both stylish and priced comfortably. I noticed riding boots can cost up to $300.00. I came across these shoes and what sold me was the price. I purchased the brown pair around Feb 2010, the color is so rich and the material is of good quality. I always get compliments every time I wear them, when I tell people the price they can't believe it. But there are downsides:1. Please do not wear these shoes in very cold weather,your toes will freeze,2. They are extremely slippery,I try to avoid walking downhill and so forth. I was forced to find a shoe repair shop and add rubber soles for an additional $30 bucks."
184402,1,"Very nice shoe, great quality. Leather is of very high quality, as it all other materials. Sole is very flexable, sign of well worked leather. Run's a tad big, but for the most part very true to size. I found these to be so comfortable I did not really notice I had a shoe on. Shoe is very light in weight, which is fine by me!"
161755,1,"I'd give them five stars but I think they're kind of ugly, not being a huge fan of the color orange. Using them for walking, about 5 miles a day, and so far they're holding up well and and are comfortable for the whole walk.Updating this review almost a year later: Still wearing these shoes, uppers still in good shape; still comfortable but about ready to be replaced, after holding up well for over 1000 miles! I'm going to try to replace them with the same shoe, I've liked them so well."
102997,0,"This is a nice swim shoe and it's well-built, but it's hard to get on."
164246,0,"These shoes look adorable, but they're inexpensive and it shows. I bought mine in white patent and I'm satisfied considering the price. I think I'll be wearing them on Halloween or other special occasions that call for fun dress up. They're not hard to walk in, the heel is high but it's stable and the platform is high enough so that it's pretty easy if you're used to walking in heels at all. I wear a size 9 reliably but I've bought Pleaser shoes before and they run small so I ordered a 10. My feet were swimming in them. I returned them (thanks for making it so easy Amazon!) and ordered my 9 and they're a little tight in the toes, but not bad. Overall great dress up fun, but the quality is not great."
195870,1,"Ok, I live in Minnesota where it has been -10 for about the last 3 weeks. I spend lots of time out on the ice, ice fishing and these have kept my feet nice and toasty warm. They are a bit on the heavier side, but it's nothing I can't deal with. They stick to the ice great, like I'm walking on cement, and they are the warmest boot I have ever worn. Can't wait to use these for some hunting next fall! Would definitely buy again and I highly recommend them."
234645,1,"Bought this one looking at the style and will give 5* for it. But it's kinda tight in the lace area when you try to put it on. Basically the mouth of the shoe is kinda small for your foot to go in, but once you wear it, then it's OK. However, your foot might pain a li'll if you wear it for a long time. It's not only true during the ""break-in"" period, but even after you've worn it for a couple of times.But it's elegant, stylist 'n classy. It goes with informals as well as formals. Best suited with blue denims or cordroys, anything that's fit at the ankle. I don't think it's a good match with ""lose at bottom"" trousers.Oh.. BTW.. I paid $29.89 for them"
228741,1,"Couldn't find the right size at the store so looked for it at Amazon, then found it and purchased here. Everything was perfect. My daughter loved this shoes, and delivery was done as expected."
382510,1,Love these lightweight flip flops! Very comfortable and well made. There are several styles available and the price is perfect to choose more than one.
19508,1,I have worn Easy spirit Women's shoes for years and they are really a good shoe.Gives good support and always fits well.
1621,1,These boots are nice looking and well designed. I have an ankle injury which is well supported by these boots.
152852,1,"The boots were bought as a gift for my wife. They were delivered promptly. She says they are very comfortable, and warm. She would recommend them to all."
240036,1,"I've always wanted to wear Keds, and now I finally can! I have wide feet, so they have always been to tight width wise. I'm so glad I was able to find them in wide width. Love the low rise of the shoe, love the look. The only thing I would change is making the inside a bit softer, and maybe more support. But I still love them!"
229316,1,"I love these black DC shoes. They have a sleek, no-frills design. The only major drawback is that you must truly break these shoes in."
343904,2,"Though I am very familiar with Chuck Taylor's and their sizing, this site confused me. I ended up ordering the incorrect size and had to send them back to the company. Though the company did end up crediting my account back."
91426,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
97359,1,Looked all over and could not find these anywhere including the Vans outlet here locally. Arrived on time and fit great.Love my Vans!!!
191724,1,just got the blue color in yesterday! love them. saw them on sale at at store for $39 so you cant beat the price of $19. totally worth it!
137088,1,"Got these for Christmas yesterday and absolutely love them! I had a pair of Converse that I wore until they had holes in the heels. These are my replacements. Comfy, reasonably priced, look great on."
327262,1,These shoes are so cozy. They don't let sand in.. keep water out.. they are soooo comfortable to walk in as well.
178311,1,"These baby shoes are amazing. They are hand made by indigenous Tibetians, which is kinda cool -- my baby is helping those in need without even knowing it! But aside from that, they are so warm and comfortable. They are great for winter use. We do plan on only using them indoors though. The lambskin soles are very soft, which is good, but probably not for outdoor running around."
346057,1,"I go through a lot of shoes. I seem to wear out a pair of sandals every year. The most recent pair of victims are these birkenstocks which I've been very happy with. I wanted comfortable sandals which would hopefully hold up reasonably well and which would not fall off my feet. These are fairly easy to put on and take off without having to futz with the buckles, yet I don't have to worry about them falling off while driving and causing a catastrophe.They made it through their first year with minimal signs of wear, so I think it's a good buy."
228026,1,"Excelent shoes, very comfortable, I use it all the days for all my activities in house, at job, etc..., it's not the first time I use converse low tops so, I can say, are very durable..!!...the most important is....always remind me when I was a kid...!!! hehehe...this seller is great too, fast shipping and the items perfect....recommended..!!"
303709,1,"Got these for my five year old daughter. They are comfortable, easy to get on and off, and are too cute!"
61635,1,"At first I ordered an 8.5 and they were too big but i was nervous about exchanging them cause i didn't want to get charged twice. but i went for it anyways to try to get an 8 and they fit perfectly and I got refunded on the shipping of the previous pair that didn't fit (and obviously didn't have to pay for the shoes again cause it was an exchange with the same vender). bottom line: definitely worth it and if you need a smaller or bigger size, definitely take the time to exchange. super easy!"
205196,0,"I actually have returned this item and am awaiting a refund. Nothing wrong w/the shoe or the company, just that the shoe tends to run a 1/2 size too small-keep that in mind when ordering."
79331,1,"Overall, I'm very pleased with these boots. They fit good and feel comfortable. I'm a size 11 womens and it's hard to find shoes that will fit properly. They do squeak a little when you walk, so if you don't mind that, then I recommend them."
266265,1,"I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT"
233651,1,"the Birkenstock Boston Clog, aubergine, is one of the most beautiful birkenstock shoe of the more than 30 pairs I have. I recommend this shoe to any one who wants beauty, comfort and value."
187733,1,"Initially, I thought shoes were a little tight (hard) and not flexible. I put them on before the game, and before playing, I thought it would take some effort to break in. Maybe wear them around the house 2/3 times then decide to send back or work with them.Then, I put them on & practiced for an hour or two, and remembered that these may be the most comfortable softball shoe that I have worn over the last 5 - 10 years.This is my second or third pair of the same 3N2 shoes. I purchased from different companies. Shoes are soft, comfortable, flexible, with high top, (the way I like them for extra support) a little wide (good for me because I prefer the wide shoe). On a scale of 1 - 10, 1 being poor, and 10 best, I rate this product a 10!"
77615,1,"While these are not Made in the USA like other Danners, (from what I can tell, all molded sole boots are not US made) they are the best mid-priced boot I have ever bought. They are made on a wide last (the 850 according to Danner's web site) and a D fit my very wide foot but was a little narrow. Not narrow enough to stop me from buying them however. I wore them in non-hiking boot condition, like in concrete pours and industrial construction. They lasted two Oregon winters where they were constantly wet but kept my feet dry. They would spend each night by the heater and then wore again the next day. They lasted 1.5 to 2 years under these conditions. I've bought construction type work boots that lasted half-that time but cost almost as much and others that cost more. As far as the color, they are not bright orange like suggested by others but they are not brown. A little leather conditioner changed them to brown however.Great boot...and very comfortable.UPDATE: 2/13/2013Just bought another pair of these yesterday...definately not orange. I bought these in a 10.5 EE and they fit great. They are even more comfortable than I remember. Very good boot. I did apply a boot grease and the color definately changed to a darker brown.Boot is great still."
346320,1,I have purchased six pairs of these wonderfully comfortable shoes that can be worn with many different types of outfits.
320246,0,It is pretty good in general but the colour in definitely not pink. It is like skin colour so it didn't match the Leotard and the skirt which I ordered for my little child from Capezio also.
5944,0,"I ordered two pairs of shoes for a musical: one black pair and one white pair. The black pair wore wonderfully, but the white pair broke a strap and when cleaned the coating peeled off the shoe."
37829,1,"I bought a pair these Skechers ten years ago and the soles were still going strong after all that time. They never got uncomfortable. The top leather started to break apart after heavy daily usage and I was worried that I would never find these shoes again. Much to my surprise Skechers still made them so I bought 2 pair just in case they stop making them in the future. I feel as if I wont need to buy new shoes for the next 15-20 years, not a bad investment considering the amount of money people spend on shoes in 2 decades. Buy the shoes, you wont be disappointed."
225890,0,"I purchased from the photo. was in a hurry that day. Glad they where the low ones he wanted. novelty item. My son wanted them , he is 30 yrs old. A fun item he used to have many years ago. the size recomendations was correct. 1/2 size smaller was just right.... Not the Hi Tops they state in the add."
233593,1,"I have worn Enzo Liberty Loafers for years because they are the perfect flat shoe. This pair did not disappoint. The quality is excellent. The leather is soft and supple. No break-in time needed. They are true to size. I purchased black smooth leather which is basic black. I recommend these shoes. They are the most comfortable shoes in my closet. A great shoe with slacks, jeans, skirts or dresses. The ordering and shipping experience was good. I received the shoes during the time frames outlined during the ordering process."
117543,1,These were in good condition when they arrived and fit right and there were no problems. They survived dress rehearsals and actual performances for the Nutcracker.
38351,1,"As always, these are great shoes. I keep them in my shopping cart all the time. When my son starts getting close to needing another pair I start watching the price. When the price comes down I order a pair or two. The service has always been great. No complaints."
272976,1,Great ledge shoes! I have a picture of myself standing on a ledge that was about the width of half of a quarter coin.
357624,1,I ordered a different pair before they were really tight. But This brand comes in a wide and makes dancing more comfortable.
323152,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
204633,1,"My most recent pair of flip flops were all rubber and, although they are easy to clean, they are not comfortable. This time I wanted a pair that had a more cushioning sole and softer piece that goes over the foot. For flip flops, these are stylish and comfortable and the size is true to my shoe size. (If there is any question, go to the next higher size.) These are too nice for yardwork (will keep the old rubber ones for that.)"
98037,1,Theses shoes are very comfortable. If you are on your feet all day then these are the shoes for you
215028,1,"Bye Bye Timberlands, bye bye China Wings hello Thorogoods. All hail the union workers who produce these boots unbelievably comfortable, no breaking in, did as everyone advised got a 1/2 size smaller perfect fit.I live in Singapore & have to pay a fortune for boots. These were cheaper than the Red Wings I sent back to the factory for resoling.Great boots"
196174,1,"I love these loafers, especially the Velcro closure. They are a great fit all the way around. The only reason I knocked off 1 star was because the upper is coming loose from the sole on the right shoe. Think I can fix it with some Superglue, but should not have to for an $80 shoe. This happened after one wearing, but have not had the problem on the black pair of the same style. Even with this small problem, I would buy these again."
141292,1,Shipment was rec'd in a timely manner. Product was exactly as stated. I would purchase from the vendor again.
291293,1,I purchase these slippers every year for my wife. She uses them around the house and she loves how comfortable they are. They were shipped on time!!
99172,1,"There are certain brands that I, and most people I know, can always depend on to deliver a good product ... Levis, Lee's, Fossil, Red Wing, Nike, etc. ... Converse is definitely in that group of brands ... AND, that's just one thing that's great about Converse... Another is thing that I love about Converse is hoe much I love... Yes love... their initiative to take their shoes and make a big STEP further with the wonderful fun and creative styles and designs they now do with them! It's great that one can even go on their site and do their own custom artwork to bring out one's own style personality! Now that's innovative and being in touch with customers!I remember back in the 70s when I was a tween that they were about mainly basketball before they took off as everyday comfortable footwear... As it moved more to that I saw a lot of designs and artwork starting to appear on the canvas shoes... Ya' know 70's stuff like peace signs, and flowers, and rainbows in psychedelic neon colors... Ha!I'm sure some saw it as graffiti or, like when the style trend was to get jeans to have that really worn look... To the extent that some took scissors to their brand new jeans and cut holes in the knees... Funny really.. But it was fun and that's why fashion and trends are fun because individual style and personality can be expressed to the world without saying a word! It wouldnt surprise me at all to find out that now they are employed by Converse to develop and design the more whimsical shoes that make for ""Happy Feet"" indeed!Anyway,Kudos to Converse for really getting that and making a good shoe that also has pazzazzzz! Also, as far as the transaction of my purchase at Amazon.com for these ... It was the same as the many many other purchases I've had before... On Amazon I know I'll find what I'm shopping for... At a better price than out and about the malls and shops ... And, if I pay attention and use all of the benefits and promotions they provide to help with cost... I truly end up on the bargain end of my consumerism... So, let's see ... I've gone way past 20 words now... Let's just say I thought it said 200 not 20! Ha!!"
289148,0,"The shoes are quite comfortable, but I find them very uncomfortable while doing extended exercise walking."
171416,1,"I saw these shoes on the feet of someone in a waiting room. I really liked the casual, comfy look of them...so I was brave enough to ask the woman what kind of shoe they were. She told me they were an Easy Spirit shoe and that they were available at Macy's. I checked Macy's online and did not find them. Then...I checked Amazon and there they were...AND they qualified for Amazon Prime. Figured I'd give them a chance. When they came a few days ago, I slipped my feet into them and they've only been OFF my feet when I'm in bed!! These are seriously the most lightweight, comfortable &#34;sneaker&#34; type shoe I've ever owned! I ordered a 7 1/2 B (Medium) and they are just right (some 7 1/2's can run a little tight on my foot). There is plenty of room in the toe and, although they are a &#34;slip-on&#34;, there is a low backing around the back that kind of &#34;cups&#34; your heel so it doesn't slip out while you're walking. I will definitely be buying more pairs (they come in different colors!)."
177615,1,"I have been buying these for years; they are by far, the most comfortable shoes I have owned. I do not use them for exercising, but every day wear type of deal. Love the ""throw back"" design and buy at least two pairs a year. I still can't get rid of my old ones though, they just get used in yard work or camping situations. Even after a few years of use and wear and tear, the comfort is still there."
324947,1,"I received these on a Friday, so I was able to break them in over a weekend. Very warm and comfortable, even without wearing socks. I ordered a size 9, my actual shoe size, and it fits perfectly. I really like the soft soles -- you can curl up on the couch or bed without worrying about scuffing up the upholstery. (At the same time, I definitely wouldn't wear these anywhere other than indoors, on carpeting or finished floors.)"
277014,1,"I just received my boots today, about 4 days after ordering. Shipping was very fast considering it was free. I'll be honest, when I first put these boots on, I literally thought ""What the hell did I just buy?"" I decided to walk around in them in a bit, because I read that they require some break-in. Well, after wearing them around the house for only a couple hours, they already are starting to feel extremely comfortable. I will test these boots out in the field as soon as possible and report back. My initial impressions are that these boots are an extreme value at only $[...]."
109588,1,"These shoes were shipped quickly, and were exactly as described. My son is thrilled with them. Thanks!"
301249,1,I ordered these for my daughter and we liked them so much I ordered another pair for myself in another color.
68981,1,My son bought these for his freshman year in High School Track. He says he was very satisfied and the zipper over the laces was very helpful to avoid those annoying laces from flopping in the wind. He said that a little hole appeared next to the zipper but that it didn't affect the performance with the shoe. He said the shoes would last you all year for competition and that they could later be used as practice spikes.
213467,1,Super comfortable.I have truly enjoyed my pair and plan to order more in a variety of colors.I can wear these all day without any foot issues. Very durable shoe.
306787,1,Its like walking on clouds. I can walk for hours in these shoes! They're made very well and make exercise less of a chore.
379300,1,This is the best shoe I have ever run in . I pronate severely and could not find a shoe locally (I live outside Boulder Colorado a real runner's mecca). I am running pain free and loving it! On top of that I bought the shoe for $40 less than I am used to paying for shoes.
316266,1,I purchased these and loved that they came almost immediately. The moccasin fits true to size as do all of my Minnetonka shoes. The color is great and the moccasin is so comfortable. I love this brand and will order more inthe future.
124415,1,This is my second pair. The tops outlast the bottoms but they are good quality. I have a c width foot so they are good for me. Everyone likes different sneakers for fit and quality. These are made well and will last about a year of daily use. I am satified with them and will keep buying them. Rob
206480,0,"I really needed half boots to help correct a back problem, and since two inch heels are not the fashion right now, they are hard to find. These Brutini's are stylish looking and they are comfortable, but in only a couple of months, they have started to peel around the toes and sides, which is disappointing."
291512,1,I bought the black boots for my 5 year old niece and she hasn't taken them off yet. The sizes are true and the company was fantastic to work with.
82445,1,these were bought as a gift for my daughter. she absolutely loves them and wears them often. thank you for a good product.
162488,1,"I loved my battery operated warmers but they were costly, broke at least once a season, had to be replaced and cumbersome. Finally, an easy to use, inexpensive way to keep my feet from getting cold. I have poor circulation in my feet and have tried everythng from the battery insoles to taping hand warmers to my socks and using pepper rubs in plastic bags. As a scuba diver, I thought this just might work. And it did. My feet aren't what I would call toasty but they certainly are ""warm"" enough, they have feeling in them and I am comfortable all day which is what matters. And that is with one pair of medium ski socks. I am thrilled to have found these and even more so by the price and ease of use. I haven't tried them in below zero (F) but they did well in single digit temps that warmed to the teens."
291963,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
194848,1,"Out of all 4 of my current Air Force military boots, this has to be the favorite. Wearing them, they feel like running shoes. They don't feel like your wearing you heavy combat boots. They're not steel or safety toed, they have a box toe only. If you want one of those installed in this, you're going to have to find a shoe guy somewhere in town to do it (I've seen them charge $50-people told me it's still worth it since they can only have steel toed boots in their job). If you're in the military, buy them at your MCSS (Military Clothing Sales Store) on base. At AAFES, they're under a hundred dollars ($98.95) and not tax of course. I do recommend you buy these. You have an excuse not to shine the rest of the boot since it has cloth and no worries of having it crack at the flexing point. I accidentally used a hose to wash vehicles, and the water didn't go through the cloth. They're not water proof, they're water resistant, so don't walk through a lake in them unless you have to. They dry fast since it's mostly cloth and not leather. My opinion, they look better than regular leather boots and require less polishing. If you do want someone to steel toe them and find a person to do it, they usually recommend to buy a half size larger than your foot."
85833,1,"they are nice, I can't wait to get them by the pool or beach. I might look funny but I don't care. Light blue and all"
83104,1,"I can't get over these flip flops. Have purchased many colors! They are soo comfortable, they have a support at the arch which rests your foot the whole time. I have walked hours with these flip flops having tendinitis. These are the only flip flop that will calm my pain and rest my feet while walking!"
236129,1,Comfortable leather shoes with sharp design and sturdy heel. A great addition to the wardrobe. Compliments both casual and formal clothing.
294623,1,I've been fighting back pain with various cardio excercise equipment for years. Different shoes never helped. I bought the Saucony Hurricane 6 and WOW!!!!! BACK PAIN GONE! This is one awesome set of super sneaks. Well worth the dough for a real back saver. Ciao! SPARKY
105261,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
27798,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
379256,1,I bought these for our trip to Maui since we were expecting to do a lot of walking and hiking. I fell in love with them the minute I put them on. They have good support which I need since I have high arches. They were perfect for hiking and dry well when they get wet. I will definitely buy these again!
224626,1,"I like black sneakers best because you can pull them off going to casual social things like neighborhood parties, cookouts, etc. and they dont look dumpy.these are comforatable and break in nicely."
211490,1,Love the shoes. I have this shoe in 5 colors. When I wanted a third WHITE pair could not find them on line at J. C. Penney's as I have in the past and could not find the white shoes on line at Easy Spirit. Amazon directed me to Shoemall.com where they had this shoe in about 18 different colors. Thank you Amazon!
163439,1,I got this for my husband for his birthday. He loved it! He had to get a size smaller than usual though because his regular size was too big.
90757,1,This is the second pair of the same shoe that i have purchased . i love them. they look good and they are pretty comfortable . hope they keep making them
179707,1,These were a Christmas gift for my son in Kentucky. He is a photographer and does a lot of work with breast cancer survivors and did a photo project with the women before and after treatment. Always wears the pink sneakers so people will ask him why. His other pair was quite tatered so I was extremely happy to find a replacement.
184933,1,"These booties are sooo cute, I love baseball and when I saw these I had to have them. My baby is due in October so I have not had a chance to use them yet, but I am really excited about them!"
88339,0,"I *love* the squishy-soft footbed for work on concrete and tile floors. But the Beach Clog allows my orthotics to roll over (outside of ankles roll under), creating ankle pain. I have fixed the problem somewhat by adding thick self-stick window insulation foam on the outside edges of the inside of the Crocs footbeds. So long as the insulation doesn't migrate, it works, sort of acceptably.I cannot wear my Crocs without orthotics because their arch support is simply not high enough. I haven't tried Crocs Relief clogs, but for we supinators with orthotics, Beach Clogs aren't what they could be.Update as of May, 2009: I CAN wear Crocs without orthotics! Necessary because window tapes kept shifting out of place. I had to try it for a couple of days to get the feel and to keep my left ankle, the roll-under one, upright (I tripped a lot while concentrating on feets and not walkways). But I can wear them sans arch supports, even out on walks for a hour or more. The only catch has been when my two labs pulled hard, and I had to shuffle loose Crocs (backstrap up -- oops!) to keep up. Lab training is not the responsibility of the Crocs people!"
114866,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
126586,1,i am very pleased with my product- it was a gift for my son who is an avid skate boarder and vans has b come 1 of his favorite shoes
307874,1,"I've never seen such a great selection of Chuck Taylor High Tops. I think this is my 5th pair. They have such great designs, nothing you would ever find in a department store. The shipping is always fast and my order has always been correct. I highly recommend this vendor!"
164407,0,"I was in search of a pair of riding boots that was both stylish and priced comfortably. I noticed riding boots can cost up to $300.00. I came across these shoes and what sold me was the price. I purchased the brown pair around Feb 2010, the color is so rich and the material is of good quality. I always get compliments every time I wear them, when I tell people the price they can't believe it. But there are downsides:1. Please do not wear these shoes in very cold weather,your toes will freeze,2. They are extremely slippery,I try to avoid walking downhill and so forth. I was forced to find a shoe repair shop and add rubber soles for an additional $30 bucks."
223636,1,"This boot is comfortable and strong and gives good ankle support. It's waterproof, but I haven't had any problems with breathability, as long as you've got good socks. I'd recommend it highly, especially since it's pretty warm. It may take a couple of weeks to break-in fully and become totally comfortable."
323967,1,I bought them to keep my golf shoes from getting all crumpled up and bent after wear than storage between games. These are well made trees.
29578,1,"I'm old fashioned I guess. I can't stand most new tennis shoe designs, I think most are downright ugly. These Reebocks are old school design, no nonsense, just comfortable shoes. I have been buying and wearing this style Reebock for at least twenty years. I hope Reebock keeps making them for another twenty years."
296796,1,"Pros:Looks great with almost everything.They break in nicelyScuff marks really add to the personality of the shoe.Cons:Sole is terribly slippery when wet. I guess that's why they're called ""desert"" treks--they're not supposed to get wet.No arch support. Personal preference.Heel too high. Also a personal preference. Granted, they'll eventually wear down, but right now it's just slightly too high above the rest of the foot to allow me to walk completely comfortably.Overall: You'll look great. Clarks last a long time (I've had my desert boots forever). If you do it right, you'll have to work into the shoes. But the rewards are great."
301488,1,"I ordered the Clarks Sunbeat Sandal to replace a pair that I had worn out, and was pleased to see that the color (Midnight Blue) in the photograph was exactly the same as my old pair. However the product that arrived, while certainly a Midnight Blue, is much darker than the color in the image.The website needs to re-photograph the ""Midnight Blue"" sandal so that shoppers will see the color they are ordering."
32552,1,"I use this bag for everything from a short two day trip, shopping at the market, dog supplies for the dog park, just everything. I love that it has so many compartments and how well the compartments are lined. It can be used for a baby bag, small laptops, file folders, etc. If you need a very versatile bag, this is the one for you. I chose the khaki, but with so many colors to choose from I am going to order a different color."
11501,1,"I previously owned a pair of these sandals (over 5 years ago) which I really liked, but for some reason they no longer fit confortably. I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels, but more casual, loose fitting shoes. My new sandals fit beautifully. I can wear them all day long in complete comfort. I'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too."
152411,1,"Cute boots!!! Love them, but definitely need to break them in before wearing them right away for long periods of time."
375014,1,"I don't wear a uniform for a living, never have, never will. Being an ornery sort I don't think I'd do well as a cop, questioning everything and not wanting to do the ruling class's dirty work for them for a mere pittance.But I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night and I have to say these are great boots for anyone. I started wearing these after a roommate who was in AFROTC sold me on them. They're very nice boots regardless of being marketed as a LE/military boot, much different than a work boot and more like a hiking boot. In fact, I also own these in brown sold as the Danner Foothill, which is marketed as a hunting boot and is the exact same except it has speedlaces and comes in basic brown instead of JBT black. Either way, my plain toe Acadias have been through a lot over four years for work and play and they're still going strong.Pros:1) They're light and comfortable compared to a work boot. Period. For what you're getting they're incredibly light, I have no idea how Danner does this beyond using a cordura upper to save weight. However, I imagine if you went to these from a tennis shoe you'd find them heavy.2) They're durable. After four years of every other day wear (I alternate with other boots to extend their life) mine have worn soles but that's about it. I imagine I'll get another year or two out of them before sending them in to be resoled for a nominal cost by Danner just because. I use the Danner boot dressing periodically to recondition the leather and brush off the cordura and that's it. They're as maintenance free as a farm girl and work just as hard too.3) They're completely waterproof to the shin and that's not hype. I walked two miles to work and back in them today (six inches of snow this morning; six inches of slush tonight) and my feet are bone dry while the cuffs of my pants are iced over. The breathe well also thanks to the cordura upper. I've blown out other waterproof boots in less than a year (their name is real similar to a hockey team up north) and was told by the vendor it's due to grit and dirt working their way into the boot and ruining the GoreTex bootie. My Acadias nearly always have a little bit of Colorado, a little bit of Montana, and a little bit of San Diego on them from work travel and even with neglect the GoreTex is still perfect. Interesting. I've snowshoed successfully with these too if that tells you anything.4) The Vibram sole is classic and functional and works well on concrete, pavement, and off road. Not so good on snow and ice but what is?5) The lace to toe means you can snug them down over a thin sock or loosen them up over a thicker sock. Very versatile.6) Despite not being insulated they're somehow warm. I have cold feet and I routinely wear these with a good wool sock down to +10-deg F with no problem. Below that they get a little chilly.7) They're made in the US and Danner will take care of you (within reason) if you have a problem. Some people don't care about the made in the US aspect; I do. BTW, I won't buy China made Danners. Read the reviews on them first.8) Zero break in period. Put them on and wear them.Cons (these are very minor; these are damn near a perfect set of boots unless you ride horses or climb poles for a living):1) These have no arch support in any way, form, or fashion. If you order a pair online without handling them I'm here to tell you these are flatter than Kansas on the inside. Ditch the subpar provided ""orthotic"" and get some quality after market insoles (not from ChinaMart either; I run SuperFeet and Sole insoles in all my boots with great success) with real arch support if you need it.2) They fit narrow. My understanding is all the US-made stitchdown Danners run narrow, so if you're on the ragged edge of having a wide foot as I am, go for the wide as these are not forgiving at all in width. I ordered a pair of Ds, laced 'em up, pulled 'em on, hobbled around the office for a few minutes, sent 'em back promptly. The wide widths fit great if you have a wideish foot and you can suck down any extra width with the laces.3) The provided laces suck. Not a big deal. Gutted 550 cord for laces will last longer than my starter marriage and work great too.4) The TSA loves my Acadias for some reason. I rarely get past the Thugs Standing Around without the Thugs fondling my Danners without dinner and a kiss first and swabbing them down for residue. Maybe it's my overall appearance. Dunno. YMMV.That's about it. I have four pairs of Acadias (plain toe Acadia, steel toe Acadia, insulated plan toe Acadia, and the Foothill) with hard use and lots of miles on them and they will not die.Buy 'em if you need 'em for work or play, run 'em hard like they're made to be used, and send 'em back to Danner to be spiffed up as needed. They'll be like an old friend in a few months I promise."
143545,1,Excellent work shoe.Looks good. So far holding nicely.Will advise diffferent if it does not.True to size.Received in a good fashion.
151713,1,"I bought some white shoes similiar to these in the summer that were so comfortable. So, when I saw these, I didn't hesitate to purchase them. I got the black patent & they look pretty cute. I wear them with jeans or dress pants."
23633,1,"The Florsheim Imperial was always a better than average shoe back when shoes were made all over the U.S. I saw these in black and thought ""uh oh"". The Floesheim retailer does not have these and the guy at Florsheim can't tell me who has them. I took a chance on Amazon. The shoes fit just like a 10.5 D is supposed to. Amazing! Stiff, shiny leather. They cut under both ankles and were close around the ball of the foot for a few days just like they were when you could buy them back in the '70's. Preventative bandaid on the left heel for only one day. Two weeks later I have great looking, broken in shoes that actually fit. My feet aren't tired and overworked after walking around the office all day. I only wish they were made in USA. Nevertheless, the shoe has twice the character of the rubberized footwear so commonplace these days. Thank you Amazon for a great price on a real pair of shoes."
240042,1,i love my sneakers. i have to say that one of the things i like is i can wash them and i have never had the problem of the front of the insole coming apart
220293,1,Seems as if I can always count on Amazon to come through with the best deals. These Reebok shoes are great. They are a perfect gift and arrived on schedule.
303145,1,"Sandals were exactly what I wanted and the delivery was fast. This is my first purchase on Amazon, but it won't be my last."
368447,1,i love this shoe! could not find it in a store at all! found it here and bought 2 pairs...took them out of the box and tried them on...perfect fit! i wore a pair to disneyland the next day for 16 hours and not a problem at all!!!!!
274964,1,This is the fifth pair of Sandro Moscoloni shoes I've purchased for my husband (one pair for my son) They both love the shoes. My husband has problems with his feet and these shoes give him comfort for the entire day. My son who also has problems with his feet has purchased several more pairs on his own. I purchased one pair for him as a birthday gift. He just loves the comfort and support and no more problems with his feet. He has dress shoes as well as casual shoes from Moscoloni and says both types are great. I highly recommend this product based on both my husband and son's comments regarding this product.
63895,1,"These sneakers are great. Super comfortable and fit really well, esp. considering they were bought online...Keds are well made I think, and they were delivered to my door in a short time.. a little pricey, but well worth it"
92345,1,"I love these! Softspots knows how to make them comfortable right away. Yes, they come a little snug, but it gives them the ability to shape to your feet. Very attractive! Highly recommend!"
253810,1,The shoe I bought was extremely cool! The last time I had a shoe like this was about three years ago. Its a Vans Omar Hassan all black super suede pretty much like this design. The difference was eS was more rugged and tough looking than the Omar Hassan series. I would love to see eS create more designs in the same super suede all black series. You can wear it likewise in semi-formal attire. My only regret is that I didnt bought a spare one for the future.
300751,1,Spring has sprung where I am and these are GREAT sandles! Comfy and they go with almost anything!
143860,1,I received the ited as described and within the expected time frame.Everything went well and I really can't complain so far.
148632,1,These were cheaper here than anywhere else I could find. I love them I see why they are more expensive than other ballet flats I have purchased.
276627,1,Great buy. Size fit perfectly. Normal wear and tear is almost unnoticeable. I gave them a four because in the beginning they cut at the back of my ankle but after a month or so of wearing them out they now fit like a glove. Came before delivery date. I highly recommend them. :) :) :) :) :)
375050,1,I am good for the next 5 years. Not cheap but the sure last a long time. And this must be 20am words.
275430,1,"Was looking for a waterproof boot with rugged durability. These boots were even better than my expectations. They feel solid, yet retain a high comfort level for your feet. Perfect for work, hiking, or when SHTF."
269793,2,"my last pair of prowalkers had a made in china tag,i'm not so sure the shoes are of the same quality as before."
54213,1,"I wear Ked sneakers always and I was over joyed to find this show at such a low price. It is just as expected, great quality and reliable shoe!"
106592,2,"I ordered my usual shoe size. It was too short and very narrow. I tried to return it, now I have no shoe, and no credit - I was told it was never received back. Very disappointing."
71636,1,I prefer a golf shoe that you don't think about. I've played in all sorts of weather and have been comfortable every time out. Quality shoe.
62453,1,"When I was growing up, my Floridian grandmother only wore one kind of shoe that I can remember: Keds. They were white, always so perfectly white, and as a fragile older woman, she could walk on her feet for days and not complain once. I can't say that it wasn't for all of the exercise classes she took in the pool at her apartment, or living directly on the boardwalk, but she never seemed to complain about her feet hurting.So why am I reminiscing about a shoe? Well, as an 18-year-old who believes she has somewhat of a fashion sense, I recently purchased a pair of black Champion Basic Canvas Lace-Up Keds through Amazon.com. I had always been more of a Converse shoe person, but with more straight-leg/boot-leg jeans in style, a size 10 Converse looks a lot bigger than it needs to. So, I went out on a limb and ordered the Keds. I must admit that they were hard to take off. It didn't really seem to matter to me that there were 4 inches of snow outside or that I was supposed to be wearing my new boots. Nope, it didn't matter to me.What I'm really trying to say here is that these Keds are by far one of the best purchases I have made in my ""adult"" life. They were cheap, about half the price of Converse, extremely comfortable, and [at least I believe] are pretty stylish. Although I'd probably never purchase the white ones, as they would remind me too much of my grandmother, any other color is great."
259600,1,"I ordered these a while back and I simply love them. They are fun, yet stylishly funky, and go with just about anything. The only downsides I can think of is that they don't have much traction, so I can't wear them as often as I would like during these long Wyoming winters.Go ahead and buy a pair! You won't regret it!"
53471,1,"I absolutely love these Keds, I bought them for recruitment and thought I'd never wear them again. I normally buy Vans but didn't want to spend that much for shoes I didn't want. I was very wrong! Love these, wear them all the time and intend on buying more Keds!"
199799,1,"I have theses shoes they are very comfortable and lightweight. Spray with scotchgard to keep nice looking. They fold up for traveling and then spring back to shape. Nice arch support, excellent walking shoes."
195381,1,This is a replacement pair for one that I just wore out!!! So comfortable that I just had to buy another pair.
347221,1,I was extremely satisfied. The shipping was BEYOND fast! I got my shoes the next day.My husband has some old blue ones and I wanted to get him ones in black. I checked for his shoe size for Chuck's (since they tend to be a size or a size and a half longer then the normal shoe size).
298980,1,I have had several pair of sketchers. These are very light weight and comfortable. I bought them for a trip where we were going to be doing alot of walking. They worked perfectly. They look nice with the feel of tennis shoes.
204782,1,"Timberland Boys' 2.0 Euro Hiker Leather and Fabric Hiking Boots, Wheat Nubuck ,13.5 M USI'm pretty happy with this pair of shoe that I bought, it fits me just right and it's very nice looking. I will definitely continue shop for shoes if there are new models coming in."
346986,1,"These are well made, very sturdy if you have problems with thin heels. They could use a bit of padding in the shoe, the inside is quite hard, would definitely recommend some gel inserts or such type thing."
110370,1,I bought these for my 14 year son for Christmas. He loves them! Now my husband wants a pair. They are heavy duty and made of quality material. My son says they are comfortable. I highly recommend these boots. They seem to be accuratley sized for my son's long narrow foot.
152514,1,"These are very nice and comfortable not to mention MADE IN THE USA. Size is true. Fast ship, great service!"
378942,0,I had to order a pair of these for my daughter for a play she is in. Normally she is between a 5 1/2 and a 6. We purchased a 6 1/2 thinking we would be ok... nope! Way too tight! We are returning the 6 1/2. After calling around we found a place about 35 minutes away that has one pair which turns out is a 7. My advice if you order these.... order 2 LARGER pairs at the same time and return the ones that don't fit since size seems to be a common issue with these shoes.
236406,1,"Shoe is fairly comfortable, gives excellent support when running and still allows your feet to breathe."
251077,1,"I found these Birkenstocks through an amazon search, and was thrilled by the price. (About $40) I wear these shoes indoors nearly every day, so I have become attached to arizona birks because of their comfort and versility throughout the seasons. (Yes I wear socks with them) This particular variety appears to fit just a little differently at the toes than my last pair, but I am not sure if that is because the last ones had worn down by the end, or if this sizing is a little different.Either way, they are Birkenstocks, that outstanding brand of shoe, that lasts for years, and are so good to your feet."
127065,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
262250,1,this is a great product. i would buy this product again. i have no regrets on making this purchase. dj
246330,0,"Got a size bigger and wider but they were tight, returned them and have yet to hear whether I got credit for shoes and shipping costs to return them."
82189,1,"last year bought the same boot, but with a 5in top. did something dumb with a friend and hurt ankel. got the higher boot for support. so far i love the boot. it fit tights, and helps take the pain out of my feet. work in car oil and grease all day. will buy again when the time comes. hope it last a year like the last one."
1319,1,"Good solid shoes, rugged and nice looking. They last a long time under heavy use. Have bought before, would buy again."
117511,1,"Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years. The only thing I don't like about them, they are not made in the UNITED STATES now.. I needed them or I would not have bought them. Hope they will give me the service the others did."
29679,1,"I honestly cannot say enough about these wonderful shoes. They stay on my twins feet easily but snugly, and because they are made with premium leather, my babies feet stay dry even on the most humid of days.I own Robeez, Pedipeds, etc... and I must say, these shoes are a much better value and also are far more durable. Try them!"
106147,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. The delivery of the shoes was great and in a timely fashion, I'm sure I will order again, and the prices can't be beat!"
114725,1,"ITS A GOOD PRODUCT, THE ONLY BUT I SEE, IS THAT THE MATERIAL FEELS VERY SYNTETHIC, BUT OVERALL, ITS A GOOD PRODUCT, I BOUGHT THESE AS A PRESENT FOR A FRIEND AND NOW SHE IS VERY HAPPY BECAUSE SHE GOT WHAT SHE WAS EXPECTING."
267147,0,relatively comfortable. The front of my ankle hurts if i lace it too tightly. We will see if this improves with breaking it in.
340668,1,"nice and confort but bigger than real size.maybe is because they are men shoes.anyway, they were enough confortable to use in daily life."
3965,1,Comfotable fit on the loose side. I use a heavier sock and works just fine. Recommended and would buy again.
273304,2,"I purchased these shoes a month ago, and though for a quick walk around try out they were fine, I quickly learned that they are constructed very poorly. The rivets that hold the sole in place are too large and protrude into your foot, which is absurdely painful. Unfortunately, I've found that Kenneth Cole products (like many others) have gone done hill in terms of quality. Maybe it was just the pair that I owned, but I'm not willing to try them again."
124898,1,I am in the process of buying myself a pair of puma &quot;Anjan&quot;.
318761,1,whoever purchases these think hard cause all my other shoes i get from amazon and elsewhere are usually 13 fit me fine and line up exactly with these in 12 so if your smart 1 size smaller i'm trying to save you alot of grief sending back and the hardships that go with that i bought mine in delaware at bosco's sale in person and there is only maybe bacco bucci shoes i've purchased on here that i got in my normal 13 that had 1 inch too much and belvedere ell skin way too big out of 40 shoes i have purchased i take back i also have to get 45 euro size 12 in joe ghost and mark nason italian boots my understanding is there are a few more brands like this also but i bet if you get your normal size it will be going back even 1 size down i have a half inch extra.
102471,1,Excelente producto y mucho mejor el servicio de envio... buen vendedor... el articulo llego en condiciones impecables y es como se describe...
135624,1,"I was lucky enough to get these slippers for $18 on sale. I love them so much, I would pay $60 for them if I needed another pair and they weren't on sale. they are so comfortable, I don't want to wear shoes any longer! They keep your feet extra warm with or without socks, hug your foot, but in a soft way and fit just perfect. And the bonus is, they look great too! I would highly recommend these slippers, on or off sale!"
39245,1,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light, stylish, and comfortable."
287098,0,"These were a good deal for the price paid, though they seem to run a half size smaller than labeled."
362641,1,"OMG! i've worn my converse everyday for an entire school year an the worst that happened was a few small holes that gave it a distressed look. you can just throw them in the washing machine an they come out as white as they were when you bought them. i got new ones after 1 year because the bottoms began to wear out slightly ( emphasis on slightly ). overall, best sneakers you will find anywhere!p.s. they look better when the laces are loose not extremely tight."
310410,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
26412,1,"The 990 Serries New Balance are some of the best shoes availible. After standing on concrete floor for 8 to 10 hours per day, I found other brands looked great, but were uncomfortable after 3 or 4 months. The New Balance shoes lasted twice as long and cost about the same price as the Nike and other brands I had previously purchased. I've bought nothing but New Balance ever since - for over 10 years now. Beside the durablity and the correct size avalibility, I find wearing shoes made in the USA rather than Korea or China a major plus!"
324228,0,"Betula sandals are affordable and comfortable. I own Birkenstock sandals also and the Betulas come very close to the Birkenstocks. I haven't had them very long yet, so I can't comment on how long they will last."
21117,1,"I love these shoes. This is my third pair. Each time I order them, they fit great and provide excellent support."
101943,0,"I ordered two pairs of shoes for a musical: one black pair and one white pair. The black pair wore wonderfully, but the white pair broke a strap and when cleaned the coating peeled off the shoe."
52783,1,"After trying on several pairs of shoes (mostly adidas and new balance), I found this to be by far the most comfortable. It feels like the shoe is really encasing my foot but my toes still have plenty of wiggle room. I got the navy/silver/yellow ones from adidas.com which don't seem to be available any more but look really nice. This one seems to have a much better price though!"
60810,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
180646,1,"We have found that by shopping on Amazon we are able to obtain all manner of items that we would not be able to purchase normally. My husband is 6'6"" tall and is a big man with big feet as you would expect. He wanted to buy these particular shoes as they were something that he had worn in his childhood and loved so much. We were not able to buy these in Australia without actually having them especially made. Phil's foot size is normally 14 wide, so we opted for the size 15 US. Absolutely perfect and for a very reasonable price.We are very happy and even though some items are way out of our purchase league due to the varying shipping costs, we are still very fortunate to have discovered Amazon."
248424,1,I am very pleased with the entire transaction of this item.I had super fast shipping that arrived in 2 days. This itemruns a little smaller than other brands so I would recommend orering 1/2 half size larger than normal. I thought at first that these would be too small for me but after having them on for about 20 minutes they conformed to my feet like gloves.I received them this morning and I haven't had them off all day.5 stars on this item and transaction.
74593,1,"I love these shoes and have been wearing them since I was a teenager, I'm now in my early thirties. The comfort hasn't changed- it's like walking barefoot almost. It feels so natural to walk in these, but they're a lot more polished-looking than flip-flops or clunky sandals. I can wear these to work, out to dinner, out to clubs, to the pool and more and I'm always comfortable and look stylish. There are lots of colors to choose from, even in my 11W size. I have flat feet and they are still comfy all day at the end of the day. The price is good, too.On a side note, my mother has severe diabetic neuropathy of the feet and lower legs, and these are the ONLY shoes she can wear- not WANT to wear (though she loves them), but literally, she HAS to wear them. They're that comfortable for her."
199936,1,"I have theses shoes they are very comfortable and lightweight. Spray with scotchgard to keep nice looking. They fold up for traveling and then spring back to shape. Nice arch support, excellent walking shoes."
250106,0,"For the price, these are very nice looking boots. Simple but attractive. Support is pretty minimal, which will be a negative for some.That said, I couldn't wear mine and sent them back. These run VERY narrow in the toebox, and also seem to run short. Buying a half size larger then your real fit might help, but that toebox is still gonna be pretty tight for many.Too bad..."
334695,1,"I got these for my husband because he loved his first pair so much. The pair I got (the taupe suede) was a lot lighter than in the picture. In the picture, they are a rich brown, and the ones that came are a light grey brown, but it is a still a lovely color and I think that my husband likes them even more than the pictured color."
119839,1,"i said the always fauthful converse 'cause its simply the best shoe i ever had, they gimme all the confort that i need to walk very much!!!! i mean walk A LOT!!!!"
295139,1,I ordered these Yak Trax after recovering from a fall on black ice 8dec10 where I shattered my kneecap and required surgery adding 7 screws and 2 wires to put my kneecap back together. Needless to say I was terrified to walk on any non-dry outside surface since then. After I bought these I've been able to walk outside on snow and ice (Wisconsin winter) without clinging to someone's arm and without feeling like I could fall at any moment. They grip the ice giving you enough traction to walk without slipping and sliding. They're a little tricky to put on but once you get the hang of it there's no problem. I'd recommend these to anyone. You can fall on ice in a split second causing you much pain and months of physical therapy.

227372,1,I bought this converses for my daughter with the idea of a weekend shoes. When she saw it she loved it so much she uses it for school. She loves them!
281633,1,"I received these shoes for Christmas and had to order another pair because they didn't fit. Sizes run big, I'm a size 13 and fit comfortably in a 12. My one gripe with this shoe is that you should wear mid-ankle or higher socks because lower styles tend to get bunched up. The only reason for 4 stars is that the sizes are big and it kept me from wearing these shoes a month ago! I will be buying more of Clark's brand."
275984,1,I ordered this shoe for my son. He wanted a good skate shoe. I wanted a reasonable price. We got both.
123807,1,"Bought a pair of these a couple months ago. The styling isn't too bad, but they fit my foot so nice I have since bought 4 more new pairs to have later, before they get discontinued everywhere."
342891,1,"Purchased for my 84 year old Mother since she has foot/arch problems.She loves them. She had same style but, wanted in the black leather."
332528,1,"I've had these shoes for about 2 years and wear them 6 days a week. They're quite comfortable, especially considering they're kind of dressy. I also like the fact that they aren't meant to be super shiny, so you know what? I don't have to polish them as often. The first thing to give out was a shoe lace. And probably because I don't polish them every day, they are starting to look a little scuffed. I'm replacing them with the exact same shoes."
223231,1,Very comfy and supportive slipper with great sole that permits one to walk outside without worry. Good looking too.
165658,0,"These shoes look adorable, but they're inexpensive and it shows. I bought mine in white patent and I'm satisfied considering the price. I think I'll be wearing them on Halloween or other special occasions that call for fun dress up. They're not hard to walk in, the heel is high but it's stable and the platform is high enough so that it's pretty easy if you're used to walking in heels at all. I wear a size 9 reliably but I've bought Pleaser shoes before and they run small so I ordered a 10. My feet were swimming in them. I returned them (thanks for making it so easy Amazon!) and ordered my 9 and they're a little tight in the toes, but not bad. Overall great dress up fun, but the quality is not great."
90655,0,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
170013,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
181935,0,"I was in search of a pair of riding boots that was both stylish and priced comfortably. I noticed riding boots can cost up to $300.00. I came across these shoes and what sold me was the price. I purchased the brown pair around Feb 2010, the color is so rich and the material is of good quality. I always get compliments every time I wear them, when I tell people the price they can't believe it. But there are downsides:1. Please do not wear these shoes in very cold weather,your toes will freeze,2. They are extremely slippery,I try to avoid walking downhill and so forth. I was forced to find a shoe repair shop and add rubber soles for an additional $30 bucks."
223222,1,"These slippers have held up very well over the last few months. The fluff on the inside has remained fluffy and not matted down.There is a very good rubber tread on the bottom so you can easily walk outside in these, even if the ground is wet. They stay on the feet perfectly and I would not hesitate ordering another pair. They are great slippers!"
137674,1,"I never know, when buying shoes over the internet, if they size will be right. These shoes are true to size, good quality, and fit perfectly!"
17556,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
343542,1,These are the only shoes my mom can wear comfortably. Great product and good price. Have ordered other colors for her
329847,1,I like the fact I can clean them. They fit great and have replaced another brand that went out of business. Love 'em
83147,1,This is a really great sandal. I have bought them in the past and have found them to be very comfortable. Not like regular flip flops. The narrow strap makes them very fashionable along with the many colors they come in. After wearing them for awhile they seem to mold to your foot shape. What I like most about them is they have a built in arch which is great for people like me who have a low arch or are flatfooted. Also the price at Amazon.com is a great buy compared to what I have payed for them in the past at other places.
185829,0,"I wear 10.5, ordered size 9-10 in Black, and the fit is good, very slipper-like (loose but not floppy). Color is much darker than photo, which I like. The sole does have heel rise similar to normal shoes, as noted in the product description. If you are looking for flat sandals, this isn't it. As far as warmth goes, the fabric is very warm BUT the fit is not conforming so they feel a bit drafty around the heel and top of the foot. I suppose this will vary from person to person, but I'd prefer a ""furry"" liner that conforms better. Also, being synthetic, they feel a bit humid on the foot, just like synthetic fabric socks. The best thing about these slippers is that they stay put when you are slipping them on or off, thanks to a grippy sole--no hands required. All in all: a good value but I will keep my eye out for something better."
369353,1,my five year old son loves these shoes. there very comfortable and he loves the lights. i highly recommed the shoes.
96816,1,I love this shoe. I've been looking for a flat comfortable shoe and Enzo is the one. I really love that fact that I was able to get this particular shoe on sale less that half the regular price and in large size. I have ordered several more colors and I love them all.
378938,1,I buy tennis shoes on line all the time and they run true to size. I wear a 5 1/2 and have trouble finding certain shoes. When I read reviews that these shoes run small I ordered 1 size up and they fit just fine. The box said 61$'s and many in my class bought from a local shoe store for that price. So this is a very good deal. I'm an senior and love to TAP now!

148254,1,"First I like the boots, but I have calf's that are larger than 14""s. That is why I ordered a lager size. They fitted fine, but when I was removing them the zippers got jammed and on one I had to destroy the zipper to get it off and the other I was able to remove with the zipper still jammed. I whish they made a boots that are not all the way to below the knee. I do superhero costumes and I like the range of colors they have. I would to liked to know more information on getting boots for a larger calf's I am not the only person that has this problem and now I may have to order a second pair of boots to replace the ones that got damaged."

184735,1,"These flip flops are extremely comfortable and cute! They are also very versatile and can be worn with jeans, shorts, dress, or bathing suit around the beach!! I have these in black as well and would love them in even more colors when i find more available! Highly recommended!"
270710,1,This was a gift for my friend and he absolutely loves them. It came on time as promised and was in perfect condition. I might even buy myself a pair. He normally wears a 9.5 but had to buy a half size down (9) and they fit perfect.
304647,1,"I bought the green color, and I wore these shoes with a solid navy suit with a green collared shirt...EVERYONE I saw that day complimented me on my shoes! They're definitely a little bold, but they'll get you noticed! I usually wear an 8.5, but based on prior reviews I ordered an 8. I wouldn't want to walk 10 miles in these shoes by any means, but I was on my feet for 2+ hrs and wasn't miserable.Definitely worth the super saver price!!!"
100100,0,it looked very new and nice but it was a little loose. I recommend buying .5 size smaller than you usually buy. Sperrys stretch anyways.

368262,1,"These are really cute shoes and comfortable. The straps can be a tad bothersome until they are broken in a little and stretched to conform with your foot, but it didn't take much time to do that. I have a couple of pairs and really like the way they look on my feet."
272515,1,"I ordered these before I found my ultimate flip flop, the Sanuk Yoga Mat. I had read a lot of reviews and ordered these in my usual size, 7M. They fit fine in length but they are slightly wide on my feet -- not to the point that they're flopping around too much but the outside strap that goes from the pinkie toe to the inside of the shoe is quite loose. The other straps keep the flip flop fairly secure but I think it would be better if the pinkie strap were a little tighter. The style is very nice which is the reason I kept the black pair ( I had also ordered brown but returned them ). They look a little dressier than your typical flip flop. For comfort, my favorite flip flop is the Sanuk Yoga Mat -- super comfortable and a better fit for a foot that isn't wide."
317636,1,"I've been wanting a pair of these for a while. Finally found them here on sale for a good price. Figured I would pick up a pair. Very happy I did. They are really comfortable. Much more so than Chuck Taylor's. The insoles are really cushy and the ""PF Wedge"" kinda confused me at first, but overall, no complaints what so ever."
389133,1,"My grandson loved them,he has a hard time to find shoes,because of his foot size(14),so he was glad when I found them.The price on these are very reasonable & fast delivery."
174736,1,I've ordered the black color last year and there were perfect.I also recently order the another pair brown color and noticed a little difference in quality. I was surprised when discovered that black one is made in BRAZIL but brown one is made in CHINA. Strange.......
215487,1,"RYKA shoes are simply the best. I am a very active aerobicsinstructor and hiker. No one makes better shoes than RYKA, period."
292850,1,"The product was handled professionally by the supplier and the supplier rendered all assistance that was needed and the product was delivered on time. Good product, good job by supplier"
322440,1,"These shoes are great! They make me look very professional, and they are made of high-quality materials.... I LOVE them!"
118136,1,Real ballet shoes at a reasonable price. We bought them for Christmas for our 3 budding prima ballerina granddaughters. They were ecstatic. They danced the day away. It made for a very Merry Christmas.
195424,1,"I love these loafers, especially the Velcro closure. They are a great fit all the way around. The only reason I knocked off 1 star was because the upper is coming loose from the sole on the right shoe. Think I can fix it with some Superglue, but should not have to for an $80 shoe. This happened after one wearing, but have not had the problem on the black pair of the same style. Even with this small problem, I would buy these again."
127506,1,"I purchased these shoes to wear for special occasions. My last pair was eaten by my bosses dog. I live in Costa Rica these shoes are not sold anywhere here. In this climate rain, mud, sand, & mold can ruin shoes quickly here. These are perfect they look stylish & are extremely comfortable. I am happy with my purchase!"
349002,1,"These shoes look awesome. They are a little snug at first but after a ""breaking in"" they feel really light and comfortable. Did I mention they look awesome???"
34473,0,They didn't have the support I was looking for but they are light and comfortable.
353183,1,i like this piece a lot due to it's style and the price i got it for.
185051,1,"This boot does not fit anyone with even a slightly large calf. Otherwise it fit well and is true to shoe size, definitely giving the wearer added height. They arent hard to walk in and were the best value for this type item. Item shipped very quickly."
112568,1,"i just got these so my review is for the early use of these shoes. right out of the box they are as comfortable a nike shoe as i have used.for me,, no need to break them in..excellent traction also..as in the past they seem to run a little small size wise. full retail at my course pro shop was $115.00.i would get another pair,,nice shoe"
244292,0,"I've ordered another style of Easy Spirit walking shoes and loved those as they fit great and need no breaking in period.... I love it when I can wear a shoe straight out of the box with no problems.This time around I decided to give the Easy Spirit Jumper style a try due the deep discounted price and good reviews. The Easy Spirit Jumper walking shoes took time to break in and were tight feeling across the top of my feet at first. I have a high arch, so this may have been why I experienced the tightness when I fist began wearing them.Also, the Easy Spirit Jumper looks a bit fuddy-duddy and not very stylish looking, but for the price I decided to keep them."
293285,1,i really like these shoes. italian leather and very fancy. i constantly get compliments on them :)
135139,1,"It's a classy shoe that fits well and rides well too. I bought a pair four years ago and they are still holding up - although they're beat up, they've become my factory loafers - I can wear them anywhere. Remember, you may be paying twice as much as normal tassel loafers, but they are definitely twice the shoe. It's so comfortable."
75083,1,My first pair of shoes I ordered was a size7- which I just measured my daughters feet- however when the shoes arrived they were too small.I think due to short back strap- her foot sits farther forward thus causing the need to have a larger size. After ordering a size 8- the shoe fits perfect and I can not get her out of the sandals. She literally wore them to bed. Great long velcro straps allows her to be able to take her own shoes off and on.
11272,0,"I bought these slippers as a Christmas present for my sister. I was really disappointed in the condition that the slippers arrived in. The box was so crushed either from insufficient packaging protection during shipping or they were plucked from inventory in that condition. In either case, I couldn't wrap the box and had to throw the slippers in a gift bag. Since Capezio is a good brand for ballet slippers, it would have been nice to have given her the gift in the box."
179494,1,"I ordered these shoes for a wedding, yeah I know, and paid the extra twenty bucks to have them shipped 2day air. They went from the East coast to the Midwest, and were five miles from my house on Friday, but UPS charges extra to deliver on Saturday. If I had known there would be an extra charge, I would have paid it, but wasn't given the option. The shoes arrived on Monday, the day after the wedding. I emailed the company to voice my displeasure, and was informed that I actually received them before I was supposed to! My advice, great shoes, great prices, just make sure you plan ahead."
370236,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
118814,1,"As far as driving shoes concerned, their not the best I've ever had, but they're pretty close. I only wear them out on the weekends, but they've held up pretty well so far. Being that the leather is white, actually makes taking care of them pretty easy with the use of a shoe whitener. However, the leather seems not quite as sturdy as other shoes I've purchased, but then again, with a gift card, these only cost me $10. A solid purchase for if I may say so."
106804,1,"I bougth it for my 23 years old son, he told me they are great and they are so comftable."
57110,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
334201,1,"After seeing these shoes online for sale, I just had to have them. I can remember when I was back in High School and if you sported Wallabee's on your feet, you were definely striding along in style. When I wear them now, I am always getting good comments and the question, ""where did you get those"". Next thing I see is that a couple of my friends are wearing them to. They may not be the same exact color, but they are the ones that are getting nice comments from people that notice them on their feet and yes, they get the same question, ""Where did you get those great looking shoes""! Dealing with Amazon.com has always been nothing but pleasurable! I have bought numerous items from them and it is always prompt shipping and notifications by email letting you know the exact status of what you purchased. I will continue buying and being a faithful customer as long as they are in operation."
327020,1,my new favorite. i live in flipflops and these are so worth it. good footbed bonus arch support. getting another pair.
341583,1,"I bought some white shoes similiar to these in the summer that were so comfortable. So, when I saw these, I didn't hesitate to purchase them. I got the black patent & they look pretty cute. I wear them with jeans or dress pants."
379216,1,These are nice sandalls and are quite comfortable. The soles unfortunately look like you stepped in something foul.... but they are comfortable and durable. I gave these a four star because the sizing does not run true to other shoe sizings. I normally wear the size I purchased but I could barely get them on and my toes touched the ends. You should probably consider ordering a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear.
156283,1,Capezio ballet shoes never disappoint. They arrived quickly and they fit perfectly. They look beautiful and they are comfortable on the 5 year old's chubby little feet.
269098,0,"The shoes are quite comfortable, but I find them very uncomfortable while doing extended exercise walking."
21898,0,"Liked the way this shoe looked and the way it was made, but it ran very, very small and the opening was too small as well. Had to send them back."
131264,1,"This is an excellent boot and great for working outdoors. They are comfortable and sturdy, providing all the protection you need."
58409,1,"I had forgotten how much I loved my ""sneakers"" back in the day when I routinely wore Keds. Now I am in love with them all over again. Great shoes!"
282158,1,"This shoe is an all around good shoe. It looks nice with pants, is comfortable, and durable. My only complaint would be the laces. For such a durable shoe, the laces are flimsy and will likely break after only minimal wear. Order a little small, as they are made of leather and will stretch. Also, the product that appeared at my door was darker in color than pictured, which was fine by me, but be aware that coloring may vary. Despite any shortcomings, I do enjoy this shoe and would likely purchase a similar product in the future."
139913,0,"Son buenos ahora pense que podian ser como los SAS, si esa son las espectativas no los compres , ahora como zapato comun no estan mal"
115879,1,"They are the only boots I wear, light weight, comfortable and good support. I'm on my feet 10 hours a day these are the only boot I will ever wear."
138911,1,"Comfortable and pretty too. However, not recommend buying from amazon. I found one in the store is cheaper..."
322823,1,"The shoe fits perfectly, works wonderfully, and is of good quality. The only problem I had with these shoes is that the material around the top of them is scratchy and hurts if I don't wear tights/socks. I'm not sure if most ballet shoes are like that at first, but all in all they're my favorite shoes that I own."
280988,0,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not &#34;tall&#34; enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
141786,1,"The Puma Men's Roma Shoe is simple but classy, yet good for everyday use. A great selection of colors assures that you'll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe. Not only do these shoes look good, but they feel good also. I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile!"
67195,1,"I purchased a pair of these sandals, as I'd had a pair of Speedo massage slides in the past (purchased from Costco). I ordered a size 6, which was the size of similar Speedo massage sandals I'd bought at Costco a few years ago (and wore to death), but found my foot was swimming in those ordered from Amazon. At first glance, I thought the wrong size (or a men's size 6) had been delivered. Besides being long, they also seem to be for Very Wide feet.In any event, they don't fit, even moving the velcro tab and, much to my chagrin, I'm returning them. You might want to try on a pair in a shop before purchasing these."
8596,1,These are the most comfortable shoes and they look great too! I have them in every color.
90740,1,These shoes are sooooooooooooo cool!!!!!!!! They are so comfortable! They are also very fashionable. They match with anything. I highly recommend these shoes for people with a sence of fashion!
336336,0,Although these shoes are really very nice looking they are unfortunately one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have tried to wear. They're ok for a couple of hours as long as you do not need to wald a distance.
241959,1,I like the material. It is soft and durable. The taps are nice and the fit is good. Sizing stated well-they run a half a size smaller than my other shoes
277283,1,"I never had problems with my feet but recently I started having problems with one of my feet. I had purchased some crocs for every one in the whole family and with my foot bothering me they became my main source of footwear. Thankfully, they are so soft and cushy like your walking on a cloud. That certainly isn't a bad thing. They aren't pretty but when your feet hurt comfort surpasses looks."
306271,1,This is the best looking shoes i saw. When I ordered them I dint think they will be so good. Most of it is leather and with a buetiful back. i dint know how the sole was but it was also great .
376586,0,I have only had the chance to use these once but I feel they did a good job. The only problem I had was getting them on and off of my shoes. I solved the problem by putting them on one pair of shoes and leaving them on that pair. I took another pair of shoes to work with me to change into. So I only have to change shoes and not have to struggle with the GripOns.
306509,1,The boots are very cute. The only thing I did not like is the gold metal toe protector. I think silver would look better. I actually took off the gold metal and the boots were all pink-I think it looks better but that is just my opinion.
347165,2,"Got her fast, but shoes are to big and it will cost me more money to send them back and then receive them back. There should be a note on how to order Converse. One size smaller than your original foot size. Now I am dealing with shoes that are to big."
104869,1,"Minnetonka mocs are always! the very best & last forever! The $ pd. on Amazon were about $10 less than other sites or in my local stores (if I can even find them). FYI; sizing very true to reg./your own size but if you wear a 1/2 size do NOT order 1 sz. up; they'll be too big so I now only buy mocs if they have my 8 1/2 size. Every Minetonka sandal, moc, boot, etc. is the best you can buy"
371307,1,"Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine since 2002 I dont skate so much but I love the style, this shoes was a little bit bigger but it's ok..good choise VANS OLD SCHOOL"
357311,1,"I ordered my Keds here because they were available in the size AND color I wanted - which never happens elsewhere. It's hard to find shoes I like that fit my feet because I wear a smallish size and have really deep insteps. But here, I was able to get exactly what I needed - 7 extra wide, red. I'm rocking them with all my favorite outfits and I will definitely be back when I want more."
231934,1,This shoe is true to size. Love it love it love it!!!!! And most stores are NOT carrying timberlands in kids sizes at the moment.
352841,1,"For me, these shoes did run true to size. The price was good, they hold up well, they arrived quickly with no problems. I was surprized in that they keep my feet just as warm as my UGGs, and for a much cheaper price. They are very popular at my college campus, but they are not the most attractive looking shoes. I would recommend wearing them in the house or out running errands. They are comfortable though, so that's definitely a plus. Good value."
96084,1,Enzo most comfortable shoes. Have been wearing them for years. I highly recommend them to all who want a comfortable shoe.
279775,1,"Timberland 50061 Newbuck Chukka is the same as this black chukka. This is THE most comfortable and lightweight all around no BS boot I've ever worn. There's no Thinsulate but it is very water ""Proof"" I'm sure you don't want to walk into a pool with them but again, they are great boots Make sure you get the 50061 they have a lighter sole than the other Timberland boots less ""Beefy"" I use them for work and for the gym as well. Just all around the best boots I've ever worn. For Deep snow I would say get an 8' at least boot but for hiking, gym, work from CA to NY the 50061 is great. The new buck gets dirty fast so get 2 pair. One for beating on and one for going out ""styling"" if you will. Again, very light weight, true to size can't beat em for under $100.00. Great for landscaping, hunting, you name it. If you need severe cold weather you may try something with an Insulate if not these are the best boots ever made. The Black model is a different # but exactly the same just in Black Leather."
257065,1,These make wonderful Taekwondo mat shoes. They decrease mat friction and still allow you to see your foot positions. They pack easily. My new one's are my 3rd pair.
313260,1,This number is absolute comfort for walking.....much admired here in New Zealand.
160461,1,"A classic shoe and still my favorite after all these years. Can't beat the price either with what sneakers cost these days. I no longer use my CTs for working out, exercise, aerobics, running or anything like that and wouldn't recommend that anybody else do so either. The cushioning is the same as it used to be back in the day, which is to say there is none. But for everyday walking, hanging out around the house, or indulging in a little retro fun these really are great shoes."
298185,0,"I am a huge Clarks Booty fan. This one I am not so sure. The suede feels soft and comfortable.The rubber bottom feels good. But, lately I'm feeling a slight pain on the top of my right foot. Could be from the upper stiching.I am a size 8 and I purchased an 8 1/2, maybe a 9 would have been better. I'll keep trying to stretch it.So, it gets a 3 star for now."
369296,1,My son sent me his list from the University of Florida and these were on them/ he opened and put them on Christmas day and they r a perfect fit - thanks!
349222,1,"This item was ordered as a gift for a relative, my nephew in Kansas. He received the item promptly and is very happy with it. Yes, we would order this item again."
39606,1,"Love the Reef Ginger flips. They have just enough of an arch, comfortable fabric strap, durable construction and will last forever. My last pair met their end at the mouth of our puppy, so I had the perfect excuse to purchase a new pair. Black and now brown. Flip flop wardrobe is complete."
45140,1,"I purchased these for my daughter who is very particular about her sneakers. She has a narrow foot and these fit great. She loves them, very comfortable, good fit, look nice."
368608,1,Great item!!!! Love them! Found them to very soft and comfortable. Great price. The metallic silver is awesome! I would buy others for sure
18668,1,"My son loved his shoes mostly for the looks, but like most converse it's not a very confortable shoe although he doesn't mind wearing it"
338715,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
223805,1,This number is absolute comfort for walking.....much admired here in New Zealand.
19633,1,My husband has worn these style shoes for sometime and these Rockports did not let us down. Excellent product as always.
133387,1,"The shoes appear to be well made, they fit my grand daughter, and were what the ballet class guidelines suggested."
95329,1,The Arizona isn't pretty but it will get you where you want to go comfortably and will outlast any other shoe you own.
344430,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
318603,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
327197,1,"I did buy the white pair of shoes and liked them so much that I ordered another pair. The second pair, the natural color, was more like gold but they are comfortable. I wear them all the time to work. It was a great price for a great pair of shoes."
271365,0,"These run small, half to a full size. They are super cute though!"
103576,1,Got these for my husbands birthday. He always wanted some white ones and feel in love with them when he saw them.
79381,1,I bought it for my wife and she love them.... they even come with extra red laces... Everythin arrived on time and in perfect condition...Thanks
369140,1,I love these flip flops. I let someone talk me into a similar brand last year and they just didn't hold up as well. So happy to be returning to REEFs!
132018,1,I recently purchased a pair of the Reebok DMX Walking shoes while on vacation in nothern California. I have a pair of New Balance 842 Walking shoes that I normally use but I left them at home. The Reebok DMX Max Walking shoes have been a pleasant surprise. They are comfortable and have the feeling of walking on air. They were also about half the price of my New Balance 842s. I did considerable walking while in northern California up and down hills and on flat land and my legs really never got tired. I now use them at home over my New Balance 842s. I normally walk 3 1/2 to 5 miles a day.
377207,2,"There is definitely something wrong here. These Danner Boots are supposed to be made here in the USA, but they fit like something that is made overseas. The pair of boots that I received initially were actually a half size too big, so I returned them for a smaller size and the length of the those boots was perfect. I took the time to size the boots properly because I haven't had a quality pair of boots since wearing Matterhorns. Unfortunately, there was no &#34;snug&#34; fit at the rear of the boots and they slipped while I walked.The first thing that is noticeable on a poorly made pair of boots is that the rear of the boots slip when sized properly.Either there was a bad run of these at the factory, or Danner is &#34;pulling a fast one!&#34; - WLK"
262218,1,i am very pleased with my purchase! i purchased these boots for my sons birthday they arrived sooner than expected in great condition! i had standard shipping and they arrived two days after i placed my order which was great so that i could complete my sons wardrobe for his birthday party! they were in good condition and authenic timberland quality!!! i would highly reccomend this seller to someone else!
270580,1,"That's right, I found them again and ordered another pair. They are extremely comfortable and I get compliments on them, everytime I wear them. (which is almost everyday lol)"
212015,1,"Love these shoes. This is my second pair. I have wide feet and these shoes were comfortable from day one. I didn't have to ""break them in"" like I usually do with any new shoes I get. The only problem I found with them is the laces could be a bit longer, but that is a minor thing compared to the comfort. I stand all day at my job and good shoes are very important in how your legs feel by the end of six hours."
12375,1,These were a gift greatfully received as they are hard to find in larger sizes. Thank goodness of internet shopping.
189049,1,These are authorized for military to wear at my deployed location and they are comfortable and convienent to and from the DFAC and bathroom. I wear my crocs as much as possible to help air out my feet. I wear them to the pool as well as when I take a shower. Mad props to these crocs.
167614,1,"I am going on my 4th pair of these and they are so fantastic. Super comfy. The only last me one season, because I wear them pretty much every day for about 4 months. It's worth it to me to keep buying them though, because they are the only flip flops that don't hurt my feet or leave blisters. Get these!"
337910,1,this is my first time buying from amazon and it was a great experience. with 3-5 day shipping they came in 3 days. the shoes are great of course. this is my third pair of converse so i knew what to expect. they were in perfect condition when i received them. definitely don't hesitate to buy!
52687,1,i just received these boots but they look great ! be sure to buy a size smaller then what you were in tennis shoes. very light weight.
68210,1,"The only casual shoe my husband will wear. He wears them to work every day, and goes through about 2 pair a year. He is hard on shoes and these hold up very well. He says they are the most comfortable shoe he can find. Most stores no longer carry this style. I was very happy to find them with the help of Amazon.com."
176979,1,This shoes look sleek no doubt about that. Ive been trying to get my hands on them for a while now but i can't seem to find them anywhere. Can anyone tell me where to buy a beautfiul shoe like this?
308467,1,"These Copa's were one of the first pairs of cleats I ever purchased, well over 20 years ago. Since then I have used many other cleats but decided to go back to my roots, as it were, and use them again. They are still great shoes - supple, simple, and effective."
267301,1,"Before my purchase I read all the rave review's about this boot. I'm now in total agreement with everyone else. This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn. After one week I bought a second pair (Black & Brown). I work in a casual dress office and, they look great!"
236311,1,I'm on my third set of Ultrascendors because I haven't found a better tennis shoe. These are so well designed and and comfortable right out of the box. These are already a classic IMHO.
343518,1,The shoes are WONDERFUL! They fit perfectly and feel great on the feet. I'm sure my wife will be ordering more of them in the future.
305268,1,"I've been buying Rockport shoes for about 15 years now. They're one of a few that have extra wide widths available (I wear an 11.5, W). They're very comfortable and long wearing. I use them for my everyday work shoes (office environment). Buying on line is great so that I don't have to go to a dozen local shoe stores looking for them. They're a little slippery on wet tile floors but grip well overall.Paid $58.90 and shipping was free. Purchased on 07-31-2009 directly from Amazon."
157748,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
21969,1,"Skecher's shoes have always provided a good fit for me since I am between a size 11.5 and 12 most shoes don'r really feel good on my feet. THe fit that these shoes provide is perfect for my feet. These shoes are great for work since I tend to walk around a lot during the day at a high school, and they look good."
94830,1,These are the same shoes that Will Smith wore and they are quite a conversation starter. They are retro but modern since they are made out of leather. This is my second pair and they last much longer than the original canvas style.
53818,1,"At first I ordered an 8.5 and they were too big but i was nervous about exchanging them cause i didn't want to get charged twice. but i went for it anyways to try to get an 8 and they fit perfectly and I got refunded on the shipping of the previous pair that didn't fit (and obviously didn't have to pay for the shoes again cause it was an exchange with the same vender). bottom line: definitely worth it and if you need a smaller or bigger size, definitely take the time to exchange. super easy!"
322232,0,"The shape is good ,but the color and it's arrangement doesn't match."
233534,1,"I've been buying these shoes since the 1990's and I love how comfortable they are. However, the last couple of pairs I got had soles that wore out quickly. I'm hoping this was a fluke and that the next pair I get will be better."
319156,1,These shoes last for SO long and fit great. The color is perfect and they are wonderful to dance in.
170844,0,"Like every one else, I have a pair of the 'incredible shrinking' Crocs. I took the advice of Scott, who also wrote a review, and I put my Croc's in boiling water for 1-2 mins. and slipped them on (over socks) after knocking the hot water off in. Kept them on until they cooled down and now they fit better then I first bought them! It worked!! No kidding!! They fit great once again, thanks for the advice. I have read that 10 minutes in the Dryer will help they 'soften' also. Glad to have my Crocs back."
244088,1,"Tried to purchase this shoe on Eastbay's website but without success. Was able to succeed getting the same shoe from Eastbay through Amazon. Thank God for Amazon, a company that knows ecommerce!!!"
178254,1,I've always been pleased with French Shriner shoes. I was a little concerned about ordering online but the shoes fit fine (and Amazon is easy to work with if they need returning). Great shoe at a great price.
153694,1,"I bought 2 pair of these boots for my husband last year, in this color and in black and they are a hit. He says they fit like a glove, the tan color are slightly tighter. Lots of looks and compliments. BTW, we live in South Texas, which is boots country. Very pleased."
232628,1,"I just got these shoes recently, but I'm already a large fan. They're very comfortable and have a true to size fit.StyleThe upper color on the shoes is a nice deep black with a suede-like texture. All around the shoe are contrasting white piping accents that really make it pop. I guess this is technically a 'Driving Shoe', but I would think of it more as a fashion sneaker. There are other nice accents like a carbon fiber window in the rear and the brown Adidas 3-stripe panel on the side. Some of the other style aspects like the Goodyear co-branding are strange, but don't bother me too much.ComfortI do a decent amount of walking around the office and different streets and have found these to be very comfortable. The sole looks very narrow and I was concerned this would feel weird, but with the shoe on, I really don't notice.FitI've worn a lot of Adidas shoes in the past, particularly theResponse Trail Shoeline, and I've always needed to go up a size (i.e. I normally wear 13, but get a 14 for Adidas). With these I just got the 13 and they fit perfectly.SummaryWell recommended, especially at the price. I knocked off a star because I don't like things made in China for political reasons, but sometimes that is hard to avoid."
126997,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
44016,1,"I just re-purchase that shoes, around yr ago, i bought the white color speers, when I found out is discount item, I re-purchase another pair (Black/gold). That is a comfortable, cool shoes.Just for your information, I am working in HK. It's very different to find DaDa basketball shoes here. I need to purchase online and ship to HK. (Takes 14 days). So you guys in North American are so lucky.I am highly recommended for those sourcing a high-quality & inexpensive basketball player. That is 100% good choice. (Try it... Very Good Deal)Excuse me! Am I too hard-sale that DaDa basketball shoes?"
247633,1,"These sneakers are lightweight and havewonderful cushioning. I wear them all the time,and have two pairs so I can switch between them.They are excellent walkers."
48906,1,"When I was a kid in the 70s, there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out, but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards, either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings. Those sneakers were great for any sport, they held up under abuse, and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike. These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design, and come in a wide variety of cuts, colors & materials. I've got several pairs of low-cuts, one pair in suede with natural (translucent brown) rubber toe, another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber, and this pair, shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber. There are a variety of color combinations to pick from, in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile. They are some of the toughest, well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well. They're the ultimate casual weekend shoe, and the most recent ones I've gotten come with a lighter, shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert, giving better support. I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too, and honestly, the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands. They can stand up to serious abuse, especially the ones made out of leather."
318972,1,"I have been buying this size and style shoefor many years... Increasingly, it is not instock at local outlet stores... glad you stock it."
44151,1,"I am an intermediate runner I would say. I run various 5K and 10K's, Half marathons and have started to dabble into the world of trail and adventure racing. I say that to let you know I am no professional but I do love to run and compete against myself. For the Kansas City half marathon this past year I wanted to try a minimalist shoe to see if my times would change any from my times I produced in Nike Vomero's and Mizuno Wave's. I tried multiple pairs of this type of shoe on and unfortunately for me (due to the color scheme) these felt the best.I was amazed at how comfortable they felt because by looking at them you would think it would feel like an old High School CC waffle, not the case. The only running I did on these prior to raceday was about 5 miles at an easy pace on a treadmill to get the feel of the shoe. Raceday comes and yes I get alot of looks but I eventually get over that. The first couple of miles were interesting and I thought I had made a mistake. However, once I got into my stride these performed greatly. I was able to maintain splits at personal record times with no thoughts about foot and leg pain. By the end of the race I had knocked off 5 minutes from my previous times, I will let you decide whether it was the shoe or training. My legs felt great as did my feet. I did have one little ""hot spot"" on one of my toes but that should be expected.I tried these just to see what it would be like to race in a minimalist shoe and I can now say I will never race in a trainer again. I swear by these shoes for racing and speedwork. Get over the color scheme and enjoy this pair of shoes. Oh yeah the ""ecco friendly"" piece doesn't hurt either."
369232,0,"I usually wear 11.5, but it was a bit small for me.The product was good, so i will try 12."
14151,1,"This slipper is comfortable and warm, great for winter days around the house. My wife doesn't like us to wear shoes in the house, so these get a lot of wear in the winter.The fur on the inside is wearing out, though, after only a year. But they are still comfortable, and work well."
282430,1,I had these boots on my wish list forever...I am so glad I got them! They are truly GREAT and COMFY...though they might not look it!!
108825,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
166803,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
358203,1,"These shoes are fine quality. They are VERY narrow and small. When ordering, order a size up, for sure! If your foot is the least bit wide, order a size up in wide. I don't know what scale they used to create these, but they are ridiculously small and narrow."
155983,1,"These shoes were for my son, who is blind. He is very sensitive to touch (size/how the shoe is made). These are one of two dress shoes he has ever felt were truely comfortable."
299624,1,I received my order in good package in 3 days. I am pleased with Amazon services. I will buy some shoes again.
175988,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
385666,0,"Of all the croc models I've tried, the Mary Janes rate as my absolute favorites! I find them amazingly comfortable, and now have them in 2 different colors which I wear all the time. The pulse red, however was a major disappointment since despite its name, it is not red at all, but an orangey melon color. Wasn't worth returning, so I gave them away as I would never wear that color. Too bad the color wasn't clearer."
325311,1,I ordered 2 pair of these one for my wife and the other pair for ME! My wife was a sexy beer girl and I was a French Maid!! as a man who has never worn high heels these were very comfortable! In fact my wife kept teasing me that if they fit so well I should do some housework in them while in my French Maid outfit! So since I'm not the kind to turn down a challenge I did!! Lol. We both had a big laugh!These are a great product!!
372219,1,I GOT MY SHOES IN THE MAIL VERY FAST I LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING I WEAR I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM.
387292,1,Could not find these shoes anywhere locally. Found them online. There are great. I work in a transmissions shop and these shoes are constantly being bombarded with oils and chemicals. They hold up well. Comfortable and the seem to last a lot longer than any other work shoe that I have gotten before.
158563,1,"I really like Adidas and I have probably bought 20 pairs or more for me and my family on Amazon. Amazon has great prices on these and when they are on sale, well that's unbeatable!"
382548,1,The sandals are exactly what I imagined. They arrived when I expected. I might even get them in another color!
16676,1,"I bought this shoe for the first time about 20 years ago and it is still the best. I tried many others. It adjusts perfectly to the foot after a while, you can use on all grass terrain. And who would believe it: it is still MADE IN GERMANY. In times where everything is produced in Asia the guys from Adidas still manufacture its finest in good old Europe."
39951,1,Very comfortable! It's like they mold to your feet with use. I wear them all the time! Sandals were true to size.
360237,1,"Daughter was required to have character shoes for the play she is in. Especially compared with the local dance store and super department store options, I feel the value is great - leather shoe at a great price. Delivery was faster than expected. Heel construction is weak though and has worn very quickly."
189677,1,Looks just as I thought it would. The sizing is acurate no problems with shipping or anything! I love them. And now I know a great way to purchase shoes without the holiday hassle
7652,0,I ordered two pair. One red and one blue. I love the red ones but the blue ones was not true to size. The blue ones seemed more narrow then the red ones. If you order blue you may want to try the wide in them.
161017,0,"I bought these around New Years, and by June, the sole was already breaking apart and the back of the heel was deteriorating. I stopped wearing them regularly and they eventually wore down further and got few holes in the canvas right above the sole. I was expecting a little higher quality unfortunately. :\"
304329,1,"I purchased these boots in white (size 8) to wear with my Halloween costume. You can't beat the price (I paid $27.00+free shipping). The quality is good and they are comfortable. If you have skinny calves like mine, these will be great for you. They fit a little less than snug, but compared to how boots usually swallow my legs whole, I was happy. A word of caution - because these boots have a glossy finish, they will scuff easy. Also, the first time I put them on to ""break them in"" (which they didn't really need) they seriously scuffed up my lanolium floor. The black scuffs came up easily enough, but you may consider taking a quick stroll down the sidewalk to scruff up the new black soles before you go scuffing someones floor. Overall, I love the boots and will keep them for future wear."
318057,1,These shoes are teriffic. This is going to be my 5th pair.They surround your foot with cushioning and when you walk the air chamber in the bottom of your shoes is like floating along the floor. If you have to be on your feet just a shift readjusts the cushioning helping your feet from hurting a lot longer than any other shoe I have ever had.Great Shoe!!
371744,1,"They look great, fabulous price, they were a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES them. Can't go wrong with Dexter"
105152,1,My wife has been wearing this shoe for almost 6 years now at work (waitress). She works full time and this shoe last approx 8 to 12 months before she replaces them with another pair. She says it's the best shoe she has ever whorn at work.
144923,1,I bought them for my wife's Christmas present so all I can tell you is they look good in the box under the tree. As far as the service they shipped quickly and came as described
374675,1,This cap is true to color and fit as suggested on Amazon. The color hasnt faded after 2 months of use. It does not easily get dirty and is not itchy. It hasnt shrunk in anyway. The colors are very brilliant and bold. I have recieved many positive comments from school staff. You just cant help but smile everytime you see a child wearing this big smiley dino hat.
297232,1,"2nd most comfortable shoe (1st being Clark's wallabees) I have ever worn. Neither of these shoes are easy on the eye and most would agree,mainly the youngins, but they are like a hybrid of shoe and slipper. Properly taken care of they will last years and they don't need to be "" broken in"". I have bought numerous pairs of Clark's wallabees and have enjoyed them all, the desert trek included. Who cares if they aren't made in the u k anymore, they are still well made and will last longer than sneakers. The price may seem steep but you will never wear a more comfortable shoe. Enjoy!"
190896,0,"These boots are not true red. They have a bit of dark brick or maroon tinge to them. I was disappointed in the color but my daughter did not notice. They seem comfortable and sturdy, although after just a few weeks there are a few spots where the color has flaked off, but I'm not surprised because they are being worn hard and often."
315593,1,"I wanted to have as close to original a pair of Penny Loafers. I was going to a DO WOP party and needed to have something on my feet from the 50's. they did the trick. Took a few days to break in and after that, comfortable and look absolutely great."
320407,0,I rated this shoe as average because the materials used are plastic feeling and very light weight. I purchased this same shoe many years ago and was impressed with the quality materials but this latest shoe is not of the same quality. Time will tell if it is as durable as my old pair. I would probably not recommend this shoe to a friend
81957,1,"I usually reserve myself to Doc Martens, but I was looking for a style change when I found these boots at an unreal price. They are lightweight and comfortable, and look very nice in solid black. The best thing about them is their durability. I am tough as hell on shoes in general, but these are very scuff resistant. I imagine these will still look good 6 months from now without any type of repair, but we'll see."
337512,0,I got the boots for my grandson. They look and they are just what I was expecting. The only problem is I think the material is to hard. My grandson always complain that they hurt. We now is the right size and with and we are using the right socks to go with that kind of boots. For little sensitive feet they should be more flexible. Other than that I will say that I own a pair of timberland boot and I been very satisfy with them but for the little ones they are having a little hard time. Oh going further need to mention that the price was right!!
105210,0,"This is a nice looking shoe, well made and good price. But I had to return them because the medium width was too narrow for my usual size B. A wide width probably would have worked, but was not available. Too bad, because I liked the style and construction, and basic oxfords for women are hard to find these days. I usually buy Timberland oxfords, and wear a 7 B, but they have no oxford styles for women at the present."
72082,1,This is the best shoe I have ever run in . I pronate severely and could not find a shoe locally (I live outside Boulder Colorado a real runner's mecca). I am running pain free and loving it! On top of that I bought the shoe for $40 less than I am used to paying for shoes.
35110,1,"Purchased this clog to replace the same clog my wife wore-out after many years of use. She LOVES these clogs. She claims they feel and wear the same as he previous pair. Seller shipped in a timely manner, and for a reasonable shipping and handling fee. Recommend this clog."
226050,1,"I got these for my brother for Christmas, and he loved them. What more can i say? Converses are awesome for anybody!"
381228,1,"As a soccer player in the off season, i wanted some good indoor shoes to practice skill: these blew my expectations! Ive had these for a while now and I have been able to practice well and help gain some skill. NOT ONLY SOCCER SHOES THOUGH! These serve as great sneakers too with a nice looking classic look to them, and they are also very comfortable. Two issue I have to address: they do not serve ankle support well, i felt it not to fit well around my ankle but the sambas fit well overall. Second issue: These shoes seem to brush up against the outer part of my feet but after around a week, they felt broken in well. High quality shoes and highly recommend them. GET THESE NOW LOL"
287032,2,"Nice shoe except, it doesn't conform to standard sizes. I bought the 12N size shoe. My foot is A/AAA. Really narrow feet! But somehow this shoe is severely pinching my little toes. I walk on my job over 20,000 paces five nights a week. So purchasing these were a waste of money. I'm willing to try the next size up though and give you a review later. But I suspect that maybe the manufacturer is using the wrong standards (Intl in lieu of US) and should publish their sizing standards in the descriptions."
24835,1,"Does anyone know where these shoes can be purchased other than the internet? My daughter needs to try them on, etc. Looking for Morris County NJ or somewhere close to that."
302827,1,"Been buying the Riva's since the 80's, will be the last work shoe I purchase anymore. This is simply the most comfortable shoe made. Wish they made a tennis shoes."
98326,1,Wore these shoes the day after they arrived... for a 12 hr. shift. They are so comfortable. Not one minute of discomfort. I definitely recommend these shoes if you are looking for comfort as well as style :)
170622,1,"My dress shoes always need attention. I'd be in meetings, flying on planes, riding in cars and I was always banging my shoes on something. Using a good shoe polish to recolor a scuff and put a gloss onto your shoes can make a real difference in how you look. Another advantage is that polishing your shoes often also helps to waterproof the leather and keep it in good shape.I like to use a good paste or cream polish and a horse hair brush to get a high gloss. Part of your appearance is your shoes and taking care of them means you care about how you present yourself in front of others!Kiwi is a good brand and I recommend it!"
239413,0,"Although I like these Malibu sandals, they are bigger than the Life Stride ""Milani"" sandals I bought a few years ago at Macy's. I thought I was purchasing the same shoe (they look similar)- my mistake. It appears that life Stride no longer makes the Milani style. I can wear the new ones with an orthopedic insert - but am disappointed that they are such a large size seven."
38912,0,"Shoe looks a bit more boot like than I anticipated.Fit wise, it runs true to size. Top of the shoe rubs my ankle bone some and is uncomfortable; I hope that goes away over time as the shoe breaks in. I probably wouldn't buy this shoe again, but will wear it until they are worn out."
315719,0,"I just received my ""navy""/black shoes. They are not the navy shown in the picture. The color is almost exactly the same as the blue in the blue/orange shoe.I haven't decided if I will keep the shoes or not. Shipping was quite fast."
252142,1,"The county fair was coming into town so I wanted a pair of boots to wear during the week. My cowgirl friend had told me Ariat boots were her favorite, so that is what i searched and these were the cheapest ones I could find. I ordered them in an 8 1/2 which is what I wear in a tennis shoe. I ordered 2 day shipping and they came in 2 days! It was great shipping. When I tried them on, they were a little big, but I went and bought a pair of thick knee-high socks and wore them for a couple days and they fit great. I had to break them in like every pair of shoe, but once I got those socks they fit perfect and I feel that if I would have gotten an 8 size, they would have been too small. Great buy!! Don't hesitate:-)"
188291,1,"I bought these pointe shoes for my daughter who is studying to become a professional ballerina. The pointe shoe manager at her ballet school fit her in these because of the shape of her feet - and especially her short toes. While she has small, boxy feet, these shoes, with their shorter vamp, make them look long and elegant. The shoes are well made and last as long as any other pointe shoe on the market."
55777,1,"The price was right, appreciated free shipping... received the product 10 days after the suggested delivery... purchased for a gift, and it arrived the day I needed it... was worried it would not arrive"
52064,1,Love these for daily use. They are soft and feel good. I wish they woudl last longer. I have had mine for a few months now and its almost time to replace !
102256,0,Sizes and fit are all over the place. I will not order any more shoes that showUS/European/UK sizes....they are not consistent to any sizing structure.
354727,1,"This purchase was another gift for Christmas. I bought this particular pair of shoes for my wife. Although it was not a direct Amazon.com purchase and I was redirected to another site, the process was easy. The shoes were shipped fast and on time, there was great communication from the site that sold them. Another great purchase!"
227892,1,"Shoes arrived in wonderful shape; packaged well; exactly what I ordered.However, we ordered the wrong size. Return went well; advised my account would be credited for purchase price only; but there was no stock available nor could they tell me when they would receive more in the size we needed. If you need a specific size, order it ASAP."
322920,0,"I received my 9.5 N ballet shoes today. Before ordering, I measured my foot from tip of big toe to end of heel.Using that number, I decided to go a half size larger ""just in case"" some of the people who warned ""too small"" were talking about my kind of foot. Well, the shoes are even too small at half a size larger!! I always buy athletic shoes one whole size longer. If I buy these again, I will do that---so if you wear a 9, get a 10! The ballet shoes have the curved toe, and that design makes the big toe land on one of the short curved sides...well, mine anyway. Also, I have a very narrow heel, and they are too big in the heel...so too short and too wide a heel if you need a narrow size. However, I will keep them and maybe order a size 10N. Do measure your foot standing on a tape measurer, and to whatever size it says to get in the measurement instructions add one full size. I want to kick myself! : kkp"
279777,1,This pair of boots is very light in weight and comfortable to wear. Very good for the cold weather. Nice boots. 5 starts
130515,2,"I, too, had the same shoe for years but the material at the top was starting to wear so I replaced it with this new shoe. The new shoe was not as comfortable at first, but after time has become more comfortable. After just over a year, I, too, have had the same problem with this replacement pair as other reviewers. The bottom of the shoe has split on both shoes. This is very troubling since my previous pair lasted for years with much more wear."
238783,1,I purchase this shoe every year. Its extremely comfortable and goes with almost every casual/sporty outfit.
82870,1,found these for a better price on amazon than anywhere. These are great casual flip flops. A little too nice for the beach...but so comfortable to walk in. The pic looked more silvery...but they are actually more subdued...which I liked. Bought 2 more pairs as gifts. I am a 7 1l2 and the 8 fit perfect..just fyi
328461,0,"You would expect a name like timberland to have reached a certain level of expertise to be able to build a $ 100.+ shoe that can compromise between comfort and toughness... ,but it doesn't ."
166896,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
357228,1,"buy them for the new year, I like the classic tennis and this is perfect, comfortable and a great price. certainly buy them again."
288377,1,These shoes are great. It only took a day or two to break them in. They look and feel great. I highly suggest them to anyone!
369421,1,"The heel is perfect for ""mature"" women, but not ""old ladyish"".Very comfortable."
373341,1,I am very pleased with these shoes. I have ordered them multiply times before.
365705,1,"Bought the book as a gift and the receiver loved it. The item came quickly and as described, great deal."
351921,1,Thanks best shoes if bought Light Nice to walk run and Work with. Going to buy another pair again in the future
236836,1,"Just what I expected and arrived in a timely manner. I have narrow feet and the B width fit pretty good, so you may want to keep that in mind if you have wide feet."
186101,0,"I bought these at the same time I bought a pair of Nike Basketball shoes.. both in size 12.5, I used the sizing guide on Eastbay to confirm the size I should buy. The Nike are a perfect fit, however these Adidas are way too small, and it is a very narrow shoe..The size is more like an 11 or 10.5, and the regular width is more like a narrow fit..Great looking shoe, very lightweight - just watch your sizing when you order this. I'd go at least a size larger, and a wide width if avaiable."
158955,1,"We could not find these anywhere in the stores for under $60.00. I was very happy with the price and the delivery was right on time. They were a gift and it was exactly what she wanted.Thanks,Theresa"
222315,0,"I had to return the shoes because the heel was too wide. The shoes were my normal size, 8M, and fit otherwise but I could not keep them."
180062,1,"It's the first time when I bought this type of shoe, but I'm telling you, I love it; comfortable, cool, nice, I can't take eyes off them; Yes I'm talking about ""CONVERSE"" by Chuck Taylor, baby."
187756,1,These shoes a nice looking and feel good. I am diabetic and there is plenty of toes room. This also rest my legs which have been operated on because if bad circulation. I would recommend these shoes to anyone who has or doesn't have leg and foot problems.
99995,1,"The shoes I ordered were just as described, with super fast service. Would do business with again. Thanks!"
56159,1,"My new keds are so awesome! They look exactly like the picture. I am so happy that I got these. They are comfy and stylish, and when they wear out, I will buy from amazon!"
221350,1,"A pair of winter boots were long due. I couldn't decide which one to buy without proper reviews. I bought this product after my cousin told me about it. Apparently she had been using it since 2 winters and was very happy with it so I decided to go for it.Please make sure that you go for the next higher size(I am a 8 1/2 so went for 9). These are very very cozy, comfortable and great value for the money. Only qualm is that the fur from its inside kept peeling off the first few days of using it make my white sock dirty:("
275226,1,"Purchased these boots originally for my son (the outdoor / boy scout / hiker) ... then went camping but my old boots (Vasque Clarion Impact Gore-Tex Hiking Boot ) which were tight even at a size 11 W... (I wear a 10.5 EEE) ... I decided to try these boots HiTec Boots at size 13M... thinking, why not give them a chance... on a weekend camp out in mud, rain and lots of walking (a Mountain Man theme camp out). The boots fit great... granted a bit long, but the width was just right, I replaced the insole with a pair of Spenco(r) Heavy Duty Insoles... they were comfortable and they kept my feet dry. So, I did the next logical thing, bought a pair for me, same size, and all... word of advise, I bought these in 11 W, they were to thin, I then bought size 13M... maybe it was just my feet, but they work for me... with a good insole, and a great lace technique, you have a good boot... enjoy."
351203,1,"Years ago I realized the value of spending money for quality footwear. That said, shelling out over $300 on a pair of boots was not an easy choice! My last few pairs of boots (including 2 pairs of Magnums) failed me within 6 months, so I wanted something that was going to last a long time. I did a lot of reading and looking around online and kept coming back to the Danner Fort Lewis. Everyone who owned a pair raved about them, so I sucked it up and took the plunge. Great decision!I have bizarre feet. At 6'4"" tall, one would expect a size 12 or greater, but I wear an 8.5-9 EE. In addition to high arches, I have hammer toes, so I need room in places most shoes don't allow; hence I wear boots most of the time. When I got these in and put them on, I was a little nervous. They seemed to fit well, but there was some rubbing on my outside toes. 2 days of break in later and I was good to go. I've now worn them for 2.5 years in a variety of conditions, including motorcycling through massive down pours and on hikes through mud and muck with no problems at all. In fact, each time I polish them (which isn't often enough), they could almost pass for new! I've been surprised at how well the waterproofing has held up, as this is often one of the first things to go. I have never treated them and they still keep my feet dry, even when I stomp through puddles just to see my wife's look of exasperation.Since buying these, I've been in the Danner Outlet in Portland a few times and learned that these are still US made boots, which is cool. They tell me they remain on of their best sellers, especially with LEOs, and the only time they sell a second pair is when someone wants a dress pair. I can believe it, they really are remarkable. As with all boots, trying them on first is a good idea, but for wear and durability, you can't do better than these!"
73056,1,"Times have now changed, however, and now I wear these around the house. When outside, I wear slip-free restaurant-style Croc look-alikes and can care less what people think of me.Until I find a wider shoe, I will always be wearing Crocs as they are simply the only shoe that has ever fit me nicely due to their extremely wide profile and tons of toe clearance.I can go as far to say that they are the only shoe that looks like it matches the same anatomical shape of the foot. Think about it for a second: how many human feet are shaped to a point like almost nearly all shoes in existence today? Needless to say, my toes have never hurt when wearing these and toe pain has always plagued me throughout my life.The last four years, as of this writing, I have had major foot problems working in a restaurant and walking around. I have heel spurs on both feet and had major toe pain on both index toes and both big toes - for some reason, they would swell up considerably at the toe joint and it would prevent me from even moving them. Ever since I switched to these shoes, I never had that problem.I used to believe we should walk barefoot as much as possible in order to strengthen our feet but now, I'm thinking the opposite because we live in an industrialized world - an industrialized world requires different needs for our bodies. I'm wearing these types of shoes everywhere and will not look back."
293236,1,"I love these shoes. When I run in them, I am faster, my feet feel lighter but supported, and my knees hurt far less than when I wear any other pair. I just bought a lightly used pair of GK-13s and a new pair of GK-15s, and I picked them up because of how well the XIs have performed."
13572,1,These shoes are the best I have ever had; they fit just fine; they look great! And the price was right!ghl
7864,1,"I previously owned a pair of these sandals (over 5 years ago) which I really liked, but for some reason they no longer fit confortably. I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels, but more casual, loose fitting shoes. My new sandals fit beautifully. I can wear them all day long in complete comfort. I'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too."
148076,1,This is the third pair that I have purchased.Drew is a great company and their shoes are the best that I have ever had.
275081,1,"The quality of this shoe is much better than I expected. The leather is high quality, the overall design is nice and fits well. Very pleased!"
372711,1,"My son wanted either red or green Chuck Taylors which are fairly difficult to find. The shoes I bought arrived quickly, were good quality, and were priced very reasonably."
241222,1,Got this pair for my girlfriend as I got a pair myself for a themed party we had and well party is over and we are still rocking them
357088,1,"I had been trying everything before for to attack and improve my cellulite in my legs and button,and nothing worked at all lately.I take care of myself going to work out,being vegan and organic...and i felt in the way of depression when i wanted to wear a mini short or skirt that which i love those so much and I used to wear that when i was younger...Since the first moment I started to use finulite ,just couple days after I noticed the improvement results surround my knees.It was a miracle for me cause I was getting some info about some very expensive laser treatments that they couldn't to guarantee me about the results that I was looking for.So when I,ve done with my first finulite set,I started with the second one right away for complete the professional recommendation.It,s been few months ago that I finish with the cellulite treatment and my legs looks amazing.I highly recommend this product for real.From women to women."
381668,0,"not bad, looks a little plain though."
325027,1,"Adidas has great cleats.I would not even try to use any other. I used adidas cleats since I was 8.Nothing to say against this one. It is simply classic and one of the best cleats ever. Comfortable, durable and does jobwhat can you say about cleats more"

291331,1,Been wearing these slippers for years. Love them - so comfortable. Easy to wear and put on. Classy and good looking.
267309,0,I have had several pairs of these boots over the years and liked them. The most recent pair had a manufacturing defect that was biting thre inside of my left ankle. I had to lace them so loose that the support was inadequate. I guess with Chinese children making boots you can't expect perfection.
258264,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
37765,1,"The bottom soles are wearing very well.The top of the shoes are wearing very well.The mid-solde is cracking along the flex-areas, but I can still wear them and will easilly purchase another pair."
157851,1,"These look so nice. I was trying to imagine them in leather when I ordered them for DH's Christmas present. He wears them all the time and they still look new. He reports they are very comfortable. Loves 'em!PS I'm not a kid, just didn't want my name all over the net."
360323,0,"I purchased these shoes a half size larger than I normally wear and found them still very tight. Toe area is quite narrow. Otherwise, well made and good height for dancing."
75571,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
55496,0,I ordered two pair. One red and one blue. I love the red ones but the blue ones was not true to size. The blue ones seemed more narrow then the red ones. If you order blue you may want to try the wide in them.
103171,1,"While I don't know much about dance yet, these have made my three year old very happy and are holding up great to weekly class and additional ""practice"" at home!"
281450,1,"Really great pair of shoes. they look awesome, very stylish and comfortable. only giving them 4 stars for being so expensive. other than that, no complaints."
116923,1,"This booties look great with about everything (jeans, a skirt or a dress) The heels make your legs look slender, they are of a medium height and very comfortable. The quality is good, I allways trip over things and it still has no scratches. They work for dressy and also for casual occations."
386201,0,This is a generic big shoe of average manufacture and materials. It is clearly foreign but none of the cost savings of such outsourcing has been passed through to the consumer. It can be extrapolated that such behavior by the owners/managers of this company will overtime generate a market niche for an on-shore competitor to retake market share with potentially higher quality materials at the same price.
301316,1,These grasshopper shoes are one of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. The sole of the shoe is cushiony and you almost feel like you are walking on air. I was a bit concerned about the light color (they only had beige available at the time of purchase). There was a little bit of dirt on the shoes and it wiped them off lightly with some warm water. I would definitely recommend these shoes especially for summer and the warmer months.
52565,2,"I couldn't really tell from the pictures, but the toe area on this shoe is very narrow. And I even purchased the wide ones. I'm on my feet all day and can't have my toes all squished up, it's uncomfortable and just asking for trouble.More importantly, and if you're thinking of buying these please pay close attention, the way the decorative leather pieces overlap just at the side of your small toe, cause a sharp painful rubbing right where you DON'T want it.I tried on the right shoe, tied it up, felt the sharp rubbing on my baby toe, and that's all she wrote. These went back in the box and back to Amazon immediately. Thank goodness they have such a hassle free return policy. Thanks Amazon!"
291028,0,"I grew up associating Bass shoes with quality, comfort & style. If these mules are a reflection of Bass' current shoe selection, I need to change my brand perception.These mules seem to be well made. They have a good outsole, a nice leather upper & a cushy insole. They fit true to size. However, they have zero arch support.As for looks, these shoes fit into the ""old lady shoe"" category. They are not out & out ugly, but they have no pizazz and are not contemporary looking. I can't pinpoint my reaction to the shoe - it could be that because they are flat makes them less stylish or perhaps the seam on the toe cap makes me react negatively to the shoe (I don't like the seam at all). I ordered them because it is very hard to find a nice dark blue/denim blue mule. Because they would be expensive to return, I will wear them with longer jeans so they will stay covered up."
93978,1,"I recently tried to purchase the Propet Women's W3902 Tour Walker Velcro from the store I previously purchased them from and was told they no longer carried this product. I searched and found them at Amazon.com - They have a very comfortable fit and are ideal for me. Best fitting Walker for the money. I love the velcro as it is so easy on and off. Love, Love, Love them."
132513,0,I measured my daughters foot and ordered the correct size for her however the shoes were way too small. The entire shoe was smaller than my daughter's bare foot! I would say to order at least a size bigger.
261382,1,These are so comfy and are really walking shoes. I liked them so much I ordered a second pair. Shoes are difficult for me to buy as my feet are small and narrow but these fit.
371059,1,"I initially ordered the 9B and found them to be both longer and narrower than I had anticipated. Exchanging them was quick and painless, but the exchanged pair came with the right boot just slightly wider than the left. I've decided the difference is negligible, so I'm keeping this pair. They still need to be broken in (especially in the ankles), but the foot bed is well padded and very comfortable."
269647,1,"Hard to find this shoe in stores. Shipping was fast. Price was right. Shoe fits well. Very pleased with the service and product and price. However, the shoe has not lasted even a year. The heels wear down quickly. Not sure I will buy another pair of this brand."
127204,1,"My pair came on time as what was schedule and everything is just as advertised. My shoes has already taken a beating, but they work just like new."
9834,1,These boots fit my son and he really likes them This is the first time I was successful in purchasing footwear on line and actually having them fit. Hooray!
322352,1,"I walk about 2 blocks to and from the office every day. This show has been very comfortable for that walk. I've had them a month and they still look new. Comfortable on my feet all day long, nice and light. This is my 4th pair of Rockports. The first 2 were outstanding, the 3rd was not so great, very uncomfortable and heavy. Nice to be back in a pair that feels good again."
285653,1,"Best shoes ever sold. Been wearing them since I was 14, and will never change. Tried to get a trendy pair before, but was greatly disappointed. Shipping was really fast to my FPO address. Thank you."
384987,1,"My daughter bought these flip flops in Florida and loved them. I have RA and cannot really wear them, but I needed something to wear to my yoga class. These were so comfortable and soft and a bit of a heel so I could actually wear them. Hers were a size 8, I needed a 7. They fit perfect."
251446,0,"The shoes run large so order a half-size lower than normal. They just didn't fit right on my Mom, she was really disappointed. Usually Easy Spirit is more true to size."
345678,1,"I ordered these a while back and I simply love them. They are fun, yet stylishly funky, and go with just about anything. The only downsides I can think of is that they don't have much traction, so I can't wear them as often as I would like during these long Wyoming winters.Go ahead and buy a pair! You won't regret it!"
18037,1,"I really like these shoes. I've been wearing store brand knock-offs for ages and I finally got a pair of proper all-stars and I'm so freakin' happy. They're more flexible and comfortable than I expected and I'd say these are comfortable enough to jog in - if I every jogged :P. But yeah, great shoes, and for this price they're totally worth it.I feel like Dwight from Sin City when I wear these xD."
34967,1,I love these shoes---I hardly wear anything else! I have them in multiple colors and they are SO comfortable!
386551,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
371605,1,"I read reviews of these before buying this pair - I have bought two pairs of Timberland boots before, one pair thats literally lasted app. 20 years with a lot of use, and another pair that only lasted two years. I received these in yesterday, and will update the review if they don't break in well or last. So far my impressions are - 1. Accurate to size, 13w, I wear New Balance / Nike wide tennis shoes as additional reference 2. Comfortable, but not cushiony if you know what I mean, I wore them all day yesterday without blisters or sore spots 3. I was expecting non insulated boots, which I got, but these are still warm to hot - gussetted tongue and no ventilation means these are not a boot I am looking forward to wearing on a construction site in the middle of a Texas summer. I have received in what I expected, and given Timberlands reputation and my exp I'm giving it 5 stars pending further experience with this pair of boots."
261853,0,"I love these Eastland shoes but can't seem to find them anymore. I was excited to see them on Amazon as my old pair is looking quite worn. When I got them, they were too small! I guess I learned my lesson and won't purchase shoes online again. I just did my first ever return to Amazon and will see how that goes. By the way, I have worn the same size shoes for years!"
343438,1,This is the most comfortable shoe that I've worn in years.I also have this shoe in white and beige and so glad to have found it in the color black. I hope it is never discontinued. The soft leather is amazing.I'm very satisfied and thank you so much.
30984,1,So beautiful. So powerful when touching the ball.I strongly recommend this item.
90690,2,"I purchased these socks based on Amazon buyer feedback. They appeared to be of good quality and fit well. However, upon the first washing, the elastic/lycra in the socks broke down. When I took the socks from the dryer, hundreds of broken elastic strings were protruding from the outside of the material. They are now worthless after a single use. I strongly recommend avoiding this product."
271453,1,"I would not recommend this shoe for anyone with wider feet. In general, the fit is good, but the toebox is a little cramped for someone with a wider foot. Would have been a perfect fit if I had an average foot."
63416,0,The boot was well priced and solidly built but not true to size.I would go at least a half size smaller.
175513,1,"I have another pair of these shoes and loved them; therefore, I purchased the pair through Amazon at a good price."
268292,1,"I have had a number of seatbelt purses. As you all may know...they are super durable. This bag serves as my carry on as well as a diaper bag. I can easy put my items, my laptop as well as my little one's diapers etc... in it. Its heavy, but its made out of seatbelts, duh! If you are going to carry this as an everyday bag, just keep in mind that its pretty bulky. Overall I like it."
359882,1,I buy tennis shoes on line all the time and they run true to size. I wear a 5 1/2 and have trouble finding certain shoes. When I read reviews that these shoes run small I ordered 1 size up and they fit just fine. The box said 61$'s and many in my class bought from a local shoe store for that price. So this is a very good deal. I'm an senior and love to TAP now!
203761,1,"What can i see... i am a reef womens a love the sandal for reef.... is the best, is durable came in a great condition"
346441,1,"All-Stars, Old School, Awful. Delivered in France, in times.Amazon's the only place where i can find huge shoes size.First purchase, definitly not last."
7204,1,"These kicks is tight. I was strollin' down the block, and some female was all like, &quot;YO! Those kicks is tight!&quot; I was all like, &quot;What you know about these kicks? I gotta show you wassup!&quot; Then later on in the day, we hooked up. So this fresh gear is where its at."
384918,1,"I got a pair of these for my 6-months pregnant wife. She says they are like ""walking on clouds.""I recommend them to any expecting dads looking to score some points!"
227185,1,"great product, just as advertised. The item was purchased at a good price and the shipping was fast. I would purchase from this person again. they come highly recommended.thanksusm1975black"
338014,1,I am not pleased with the fact that I returned the item & requested an exchange of a smaller size. Instead I was given a refund even after I filled out the exchange request. This was a gift for my daughter & she was disappointed that they refused to make the exchange.
315203,1,I've bought the same shoes in 1999 and I used them every day in every weather condition for 5 years.I really love them and think to buy a new pair.These are the best product I've ever seen.
131207,1,"After buying my first pair of Clark's Natureveldt back in '02 I had to get a pair in black. The only place that carried the original Natureveldt is Amazon, as other carriers only have the currrent model, Nature 3. I placed my order and received them within 2 days. They feel great just as I remember them."
201071,1,"They are very fashionable. Many people on my college campus wear them in a variety of colors. I am a size 11 foot and bought 10.5 and it fit great. WORD OF ADVICE: If it fits too loose and your not wearing socks, this shoe will destroy your heel. But if it fits correctly it is very comfortable and supportive."
266715,0,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
210211,1,"Great fit. I read other reviews saying this shoe runs large, but I'm almost always a 9 in Nine West shoes and this one was no exception. These are higher than I realized but still easy to walk and stand in. I love that these aren't plain leather - the suede adds a nice extra touch without making them feel like I saved them from the 90s."
307031,1,These are fabulous boots. My second pair...very comfortable. I can wear them all day without any problems. Great for work or weekend. Highly recommended!
258712,1,this shoe is the most comfortable running if have ever had.Thanks
261556,1,These are classic Converse shoes. They arrived quickly. The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform.
143789,1,"These are some of the best shoes I have ever bought. Would recomend them to everyone looking for good fit, and good value."
285117,0,"Sexy, but too tall for me. I'm 5'3"", and these boots went almost all the way up to my crotch. Since they went so high, they squeezed at a very bad spot (think muffin tops of the legs). I am pretty slim too, so that wasn't the problem. Wish they had them in ""petite""."
332098,1,These shoes are very comfortable and look great. They're perfect for work and casual wear. I would highly recommend them.
305770,1,I'm using this shoe now because it is easy to get on. I prefer the world class walking shoe by rockport but it is harder to get on for me.
330252,1,I first wore Rockports when we lived in Wisconsin in 1985. Lately I have had trouble finding my size (extra wide) here in Texas. Amazon has them in several styles at a very competitive price so I ordered a pair. The arrived in a few days and are just like I remember them. I will be ordering another color the next time I wear out a non-Rockport pair of shoes.I work in a 2.25 million square foot hospital and put in about 1.5 miles before 8:00 AM. I appreciate that the Rockports offer great arch support and are surprisingly light weight.
360981,0,"They are cute, and cushy on the bottom of the feet, but rather narrow, and uncomfortable at the edge of the heels."
273345,1,"Working a new job, I needed to wear nicer shoes. Didn't want to mess up my best pair so I bought these Skechers. Much better than I was expecting. May need to just clean up another old pair and keep these for going out on weekends. Highly Recommend."
304931,1,i brought the shoe for my belly dance class. the shoe is worth it however the sizing is off by a shoe size. i wear a 10 and i should have ordered a 9.
224743,1,"Wonderful sneakers! They are comfortable and stylish. They run slightly large ( I wear a size 7 shoe, so I ordered a 7). They are very roomie, but comfortable and I can wear thick socks with them if I need to."
361478,1,"I wear flip flops a lot here in Florida. These are the most comfortable I've put on my feet, but they were also the most expensive I've ever bought"
259986,1,"I got these for my brother for Christmas, and he loved them. What more can i say? Converses are awesome for anybody!"
152439,1,"I wear them almost every day. They look just as they do in the picture, and they're so comfortable. They're my favorite pair of Sanuk's yet. They've stretched out a little, obviously, but they still pretty much fit."
179008,1,"Ordered these online. The first time they arrived we realized we had ordered them a size smaller than we needed. The return process was clear and simple - we mailed them back at no cost and were refunded the entire balance. We ordered the correct pair and received those in just a few days. They arrived in great condition, the right price, the right product, and in the right amount of time. No complaints, only praise for this vendor. Great job."
312025,1,"Fast delivery and I like these shoes a lot, fit is a little tight, but im sure after breakin they will be just right, very well made and good looking too.."
140677,1,"I was first introduced to this awesome sandal by my sister, who gave me a pair she'd worn for about a year that she'd actually been given by a friend who'd worn them for a few years even before that! They both had gotten new pairs but neither one wanted to see this ""old"" pair go to waste because there was nothing structurally wrong with them.I wore this pair nearly every day that was weather-permitting (in Utah), which was about 6 months of the year for about 7 more years. They FINALLY gave out! I wore them until the bottom sole was so worn through that one of the straps eventually came loose and a nice penny-size hole wore through right at the ball of my foot. Even the originally inch thick heel was getting close! Did I stop wearing them? Oh my, no. I merely tied the strap to another strap and did my best to ignore the ever-growing hole. I just purchased another pair to finally lay this vigilant pair to rest and can't wait!Since I didn't have to do any of the breaking-in, I can only say that these were not just the most comfortable pair of sandals I've ever worn, but hands-down the most comfortable shoe that this shoe nut has ever had on her feet. My vast shoe collection became severely neglected once these hit my rack! I have incredibly high arches and never had any issues at all with the straps - as I mentioned though, I didn't do the breaking-in. The straps themselves will ease up and loosen over time though and also bear in mind that the insole is specifically designed to shape and mold around your foot, so your foot itself will eventually rest lower down in the shoe, which will also ease any strap pressure. This process, from what I have read in many reviews happens fairly quickly too. I'll be finding out for myself, however, within the week! Yay!I'm INCREDIBLY excited to have this Teva again and have frequently recommended it to people who comment about them - which a LOT of people do."
336532,1,Very comfortable sandle. Hard to find a good quality sandle that offers support and leave your feet feeling good even after walking a long time. The sole is thick enough to absorb hard pavement. Best sandle I've ever owned.
69311,1,"I run marathons and various triathlon distances, and have done plenty of miles happily on Asics Kayanos. I was worried about the cushioning on such a lightweight shoe when I took them out of the box. But they run beautifully. They are so incredibly light it makes a noticeable difference to my running. Not sure how long they would last given their minimalist design, but I guess we tend to retire our shoes before there are any signs of wear & tear on the upper part of the shoe anyway. The only issue for me is the tongue design - yes the single-fold makes sense in a weight-saving capacity, and once the shoes are on there are no comfort issues (on the contrary they feel great), but if you do triathlons and need to do a fast transition, you need to spend a bit longer to make sure they are put on right. Nevertheless, they are still my new favorite running shoe. JK"
152252,0,I got this product on sale and i am so glad i didn't pay full price not worth it. They get slippery when is wet. I don't have wide feet and after walking on them for a few hours they start hurting on the sides. It makes my feet sweat and smell and it was the same with the two pair of keen sandals that my little boy had owned.
159623,0,"I bought these around New Years, and by June, the sole was already breaking apart and the back of the heel was deteriorating. I stopped wearing them regularly and they eventually wore down further and got few holes in the canvas right above the sole. I was expecting a little higher quality unfortunately. :\"
326125,1,"Birkenstock shoes are the best fit for my feet, and are durable. Good shoes-good price-fast service. I reccomend this site."
39858,1,"These are my favorite Flip Flops.... so comfy, yet cute. And in Black they can pass for more than sporty.... I keep buying them year after year."
217822,1,"I ordered the ""Chuck Taylor"" Converse All Stars in Black, just because I think they go with almost everything. The packaging was fine and I had no issues with the product. It arrived before the projected date and looked exactly like the photo. The box did include two pairs of laces, both black and white. I've been wearing Converse Chuck Taylors for years and needed to replace my pair that I've worn out. I rotate my shoes, so they had just ran their course. I really enjoy these shoes, I like the look, the style (which is very classic), and the comfort. These are the most recognized sneaker, ever. More people comment on these more than any other pair that I own. The only drawback is that they run large. Make sure when you order them, you order them to your true size. Other than that, I have had no issues. YMMV."
224213,1,"I ordered these sneakers for my cousin. He loves them! Great pair of basic sneakers that blends well with any outfit. Great decision, rather than over priced sneakers!"
158914,1,"An old school shoe, with style. How did our feet survive these things? Oh, that's right, they didn't."
40302,1,"I really like these flip flops, but when I walk in them they make a lot of noise. The flip flop noise if you know what I mean! They are the loudest flip flops I have ever owned. When I walk I try to hold them closer to my foot (so they won't be so loud), but it does not seem to work. Other than that, it did take alittle while to get use to the arch support. I have only ever had flat flip flops. I'm not sure if they are the best for walking long distances which is what I wanted. But basically they are comfortable and look nice."
194117,1,"have been wearing this style of sandle for years, don't know what i would do without them. and i am a shoe person!"
207089,0,"This is the first shoe I have had in years that was wide enough for me; I bought the 4E. They do run a little short; I normally wear a 7-7.5 and with these in an 8 one toe hits the end. The biggest problem I had is that the shoes are way, way too big top to bottom. However, now that I have layered an insole and ball-of-foot pads over the shoe's removable insole, they fit pretty well and are very comfortable. They do get a little bit hot, as someone else mentioned. I am very happy to be able to stand and walk in them a lot and yet not look clunky. The leather is showing creases after just a few days of wearing them though."
94377,1,"I was worried in the beginning as they did not feel very comfortable. They were very stiff around my toes, but after one or two days of walking around, they start feeling great. I never had blisters or anything, so it was just a mild adaptation. So I am quite satisfied with them after all!"
204684,1,"I was a lifeguard for years, for summers I lived in these! They have a wonderful foam-like sole, but the best part is the fabric material that holds your foot. I never had a blister or any discomfort while wearing them. My grandmother borrowed a pair of mine to wear, she was very fond of them and I bought her this pair for Christmas. I currently have three pairs; I went through my first pair of the 'Ginger' Reefs. They had a thinner sole, which I wore through in a summer, I'm sure it was because I was walking across the rough cement all day long. I found that the ""Sandy"" Reefs stood up better; they also have a rubber like base to the shoe, which held up at work. Since my grandmother and I both enjoy them, I would defiantly recommend them to anyone."

64669,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
255480,1,My husband loves this shoe and has been wearing the reebok brand shoes for many years. This one seems to withstand the best. Great shoe and I hope that we can always find it when we need it. Thank you
313206,1,Greatest Most durable boots I've ever purchased. I'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid. All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost. I'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting.
273970,1,"Fantastic fit and feel.. negative heal-cup = comfort.found the best deal on the net, shoesontheweb.comOverstock said they price match.. but that turned out to be bunk.I've had a pair of everything Birks, keen, .. My favorite pair was from Bass (suv series). But they were discontinued. I couldn't be happier with these. It's been a few months too and they are wearing well. I use them like slippers--mostly indoors."
317255,0,"I've had various NB cross training shoes over the years and really liked them. But I've never had any that were so slippery on hard wet surfaces as these are. Even after a few weeks of wear, they are still like ice skates when the walking on wet sidewalks and roads. Be careful!!!"
142806,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
328435,2,"I bought these for a halloween costume, and even though I selected standard shipping, the cost didn't show up on the balance until I got the confirmation and the order had gone through--shipping cost as much as the shoes I thought I was getting at a discount!Also, though I used the conversion chart to get a women's size, they ended up being too small."
381980,1,This is the third pair of these shoes I have bought. All different colors. They are great to wear in the office in the summer.
110859,0,these shoes are so well fitting and cushiony and durable. My feet are in haven
323358,1,"I love my 574's. Got the black and silver with the dark gray foam about a year ago (my 3rd pair), and walked all over Mexico in them. They've stood up really well, and have aged really well too. Prices seem to fluctuate a lot on them, but whatever you end up paying, they're pretty much worth it. I like darker colors because of their versatility, and their durability, and if you can avoid the white foam I highly advise it because the dirtier your shoes get, the worse they look. An who wants to pay good money to look a shambles?"
251427,1,Love the shoes. I have this shoe in 5 colors. When I wanted a third WHITE pair could not find them on line at J. C. Penney's as I have in the past and could not find the white shoes on line at Easy Spirit. Amazon directed me to Shoemall.com where they had this shoe in about 18 different colors. Thank you Amazon!
388540,1,"I have been ordering and wearing these shoes as casual work shoes for 10 years. They are well made, a good price and the thing I like the most about them is how many different sizes/widths are available. Once you find the size you need you can depend on always getting a shoe that will fit."
163675,0,"I bought these shoes to complete my cheerleading costume for a special event. They looked Great!Customizable: The color blocks are easy to interchange, they tie into the laces, so they stay well, too.Size: The shoes were very comfortable, and I found them true to size - I wear an 8 1/2, and I bought the size 9. As with running shoes, I find that you should always go up at least a 1/2 size to account for the forward motion, and they fit perfectly. There was a little extra room, as expected, but when jumping around in them, I found them to be great.Traction: My only concern was that there was little to no traction. This may not matter for your use of the shoes, but I was wearing them on a slick dance floor, and when someone spilled a drink, I fell pretty hard. If using on a track surface, grass, or other ""standard"" cheerleading materials, this may not be a concern for you."
80919,1,"They came in a timely manner, in the little Converse box. They're just as the should be: classic kicks that will last a long time."
62003,1,"I hike fairly frequently in the Sierra mountains, often in rocky, steep or muddy terrains. So I spent a good amount of time researching for the best pair of boots that will provide and comfort and durability for an all-day hike. I finally decided on these Altitude IV boots.I was very pleased with my decision, as they were very comfy, no blisters, and durable, not to mention better looking than other hiking boots. Good grip over rocks, mud and dirt trails. I will buy another pair of Altitude IV after these wear out."
60431,0,"These seemed like good quality boots, however the sizing was 1/2 a size off. I ended up returning the product so I can't speak for actual comfort or longevity of product. But it is frustrating when a product doesn't fit. Shoes are usually pretty constant too. I purchased these particular ones based on all the great reviews but I didn't see any that commented on sizing issues, so just beware."
298941,1,"Me and my husband both took this bag on our honeymoon to the Mediterranean and we loved the bag! We went to Italy, Greece and Turkey and this bag went everywhere with us on all the excursions. We went to tons of ruins and hiked everywhere and this bag held up great! It was great to just sling over my chest and keep safe close to me plus all the compartments were amazing! It could hold so much and there was a nice compartment for my camera that kept it ready for any pictures. I would recommend this to anyone going on any kind of trip. We definitely plan to take our bags on any future trips we take. Thanks to company for making such a great quality product!!"
38156,1,"The only casual shoe my husband will wear. He wears them to work every day, and goes through about 2 pair a year. He is hard on shoes and these hold up very well. He says they are the most comfortable shoe he can find. Most stores no longer carry this style. I was very happy to find them with the help of Amazon.com."
90830,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. The delivery of the shoes was great and in a timely fashion, I'm sure I will order again, and the prices can't be beat!"
360622,2,"I was told by my director a week before our show opened that he wanted me to wear black character shoes instead of tan. Having Amazon Prime, I ordered this product which verified that the shoes would be delivered in two days. However, four days later I still hadn't recieved the delivery. When I went to track my package, the delivery estimate was still set for two days after I ordered it yet the order hadn't even been shipped yet- four days later! After a week of nothing, I checked again and now the order has disappeared from my account as if I never even ordered them in the first place. Needless to say, there was no reliability from this company who- after making a mistake by not shipping my shoes- decided to just erase the order entirely. I rarely write reviews but feel as if I should warn other customers before something similar happens to them."
89117,1,"I purchased a pair of these boots over a year ago for my job as a local Mall Guard. I wanted steel toe protection just in case i had to break up a fight and some kid would try to step on my foot. Turned out the steel toe was unnessicary. What I can say was this boot held up resonably well under the conditions i put it through. I walked over 5 miles a day on a hard tile floor at first for 5 days a week then for 3 when i went to nights. these boots held up. After over a year and a half the front foot tread area is compleatly flat. the tread is worn compleatly off, at the back i have a large heel bevel but when i think about how much i walked with them on. Just to let you know the velvet ease comfort insole installed in the boot will flatten out in no time and your going to have to come up with one on your own, also its not really water proof. Just to let everyone know its a B.A Mason boot at a higher price, I got mine for 109 out of the Mason Catalog and thats what its really worth. Also it's Made In China and they have the nerve to call it work america. So to sum up It's a good boot thats going to do what an old school work boot was made to do, Its nothing fancy but it will do its job. Better Yet its cheap enough that when you wear em out you can toss em and get another pair. The only problem is the lack of padding and a very hard rubber sole. But of corse a cushion insole can fix that. Also they have a padded collar at the top to keep the leather from eating your ankle. I can attest to this i beat the crap out of mine and they held up. Another Nice feature is they do come in narrow B widths. If you cant find em here head on over to B.A Mason"
305210,0,"These boots are beautiful and look like excellent quality. They arrived promptly.Unfortunately they are too big and we had to return them. The heel is too wide and the foot slips around inside. We ordered 1/2 size smaller than usual due to the reviews we read, but guess we should have gone a full size smaller."
201434,0,"Awesome shoe. Looks great, I have the coffee suede, and is fantastically comfortable. Just beware the for both myself and a friend of mine the shoe ran a half size too big (I'm a 9.5 but needed a 9 in this shoe, she's a 9 and needed a 8.5)"
388161,1,"I love all the sexy and high-heeled shoes out there, but as we age, they are not as suitable as when we were young (and even then probably not). This style of Naot is somewhat magical - I've had many compliments, such as, they look like ballerina shoes, funky, stylish, classy, versatile - can wear them with pants or skirts. They've become my signature shoe - I have two pair in different colours. I can walk for miles in these shoes, they are that comfortable. I highly recommend them."
285743,1,"These cleats are the best. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on them since I don't play competitively anymore but after too many seasons of blisters I went back to these. I love them, there's a reason they've been the go to clear for so many years."
98947,1,"the shoes were perfect and came right on time. however, the very first time i wore them, they got scuffed by a tricky curb. i wish you could have installed some kind of invisable force field around them so that they would stay so white. you really need to work on that."
187091,1,"After placing my order for these shoues, they arrived very soon.They're comfortable (and ideal for me because I have diabetes; the velcro allows you to adjust the tightness of the shoes). Great traction on the bottom. Very nice looking. They appear to be well constructed and should last many years."
14072,1,"since buying these slippers for my son he wears them and tells me that they are so so comfortable. The color is transparent to dirt so if you have a high schooler like I do and are looking for a pair of slippers these are for ""You""!"

191417,1,"I love these shoes. They have become an essential part of my wardrobe. While some might say they are a bit tall, I find I can wear them through a whole day without a problem. They go with almost anything."
69106,0,"I really wanted these shoes to work out, but they didn't fit. The right shoe was too small, which is kind of weird because I had also tried one-half size larger, but the right shoe in that size was too large. Maybe I was having a Goldilocks experience, but I'm not normally hard to fit in the shoe department."
272747,1,"I LOVE these. Trekked all throughout Costa Rica in them and they held up great. Through wet, dry, hard, soft surfaces, these were a phenomenal addition to my trip. They lasted a little over a year for me (they went through a month in Costa Rica, three months at a summer camp, multiple music fests, and many other outdoor excursions) but I have no qualms with purchasing a new pair. Great price and super cute too!"
138391,1,"These are a beautiful pair of pumps. I love the tailored look I can wear with them: trousers and a vest. You get not just the ribbon ties as seen in the picture but also regular cord ties, though I think the ribbon is much more attractive. The only complaint I have about these pumps is that there isn't a lot of padding inside, so as the day went on my foot would rub back and forth in the front and cause some friction. Other than that they are wonderful."
297252,1,This is the best looking shoes i saw. When I ordered them I dint think they will be so good. Most of it is leather and with a buetiful back. i dint know how the sole was but it was also great .
298252,0,"Read the reviews (5 stars) before purchasing these shoes and this is what prompted me to purchase them. When I finally got them, I was a little disappointed because they are higher than I expected and a bit unstable. These shoes are good if you are mostly sitting down and they look very sexy. However, I'm not so sure that I can walk in these for more than 5 minutes. If you are an expert stiletto wearer then these are the shoes for you."
161904,0,Some guys I work with on my Army dive team swear by these as dive booties because you can take your fins off and move out cross country without having to stop and put on boots. I bought a pair to try out and thought they were ok. I have kind of a wide foot and low arches so this shoe isn't really made for my foot.
346203,1,Sneakers were a gift for son-in-law. That's the kind he likes. He's happy.
331604,0,"Ordered for my husband for Fathers Day. His normal shoe size is 10 1/2. So I ordered size 11. Way too large. Then re-ordered size 10, STILL way too large. Hopefully size 9 will fit. A full size and a half smaller than normal shoe size! I also ordered a pair for myself. My normal size is 8. So of course I order size 8, way too big too. Re-ordered size 7. These did fit."

76202,1,"I needed a warm pair of winter boots that I could wear with dress pants. Mine fit well, but I'm glad they've loosened up a bit over time. I've gotten many compliments on these shoes."
343975,0,Fast delivery - but my wife says the shoes are very poor quality.Worn once and tossed into the trash.Not the seller's fault however - so 5 stars to them and 1 to the mfg. thus 3 stars.
282025,1,"My knees were killing me and my toes were ate up with blisters and black toenails (gross I know, but you long distance runners know what I mean). My shoe guy put me in this shoe and voila, no more blisters and no more sore knees (well, it wasn't quite voila as my knees took a little while to adjust to the change in mechanics and heal up and the toes are still healing, but it was plenty quick for all that). Anyway, I'm in heaven. I didn't realize I was an overpronater, well I thought I was, but didn't realize how much a shoe could help. Also, these shoes are a little small (as are all running shoes) so size up a little to avoid the toes thing. I've run 3 half marathons and 2 marathons in these in less than two months. Hurray for no more sore knees. The 15 miler and half marathon right before that in the old shoes were terrible. I've saved those old ones for short trail runs in the mud. Btw, my shoe guy recommended inserts for these as he says the ones that come with the shoe wear out really quick."
381009,1,"Product came on date as expected. I am a novice ballroom dancer of about half a year. This is the first pair of dance shoes that I purchased. I chose it as it is affordable and seemed to be good quality. As it is a practice shoe, I was not expecting it to be great looking. It isn't great and it isn't bad. I am used to higher heels and ended up ordering a 1.75"" that wasn't as high as I expected but that is fine, i think the highest available was 2"" anyway. As suggested by other reviewers, I ordered a size larger than my street shoe size and it fits fine, it isn't snug. Next time I might just order a half size larger instead of a fullsize as people say dance shoes should be snug. I went a whole inch more primarily to ensure the width fit fine as mine is a bit wider though i don't normally buy wide.My first impression is that it is nice and light and I like the fact that the sole has a little bit of arch support. I also like that it seems to be quality made for it's price tag. Not like many China-made versions for a similar price point. I don't think I will have any concerns that the sole will lift as it is sewn into the shoe versus others that is apparent that they just glue it down."
330443,0,My husband liked the shoe but we had to return. His usually wears a 9.5 M but these were way too narrow and he does not want to re-order.
67219,0,"The color of the shoe was better than I thought. The shoe is made of a more traditional, stiff leather. It is a little loose and the right foot when I step creases across the toes causing discomfort. I kept them because I liked the style and color. I have hopes the leather will eventually soften with use. It is my first pair of cole hans. The price was right on amazon!"
87348,1,Comfortable and very tall. I can walk around in it for hours but it can get chafey/sweaty in extremely hot 100F+ weather.
288311,1,I ordered these shoes for a trip that I was taking. they worked out very well in the smokies.
205571,2,"I ordered these shoes for a wedding, but I had to return them. I tried them on for about 3 seconds and my feet were hurting. Since the heel is pretty high, you foot slides forward and there is not much shoe to hold your foot in place. This one strap right across my toes was bascially squeezing my foot into the shoe and it hurt!"
46596,1,"i loved this shoes, i have problems with my heels and this shoes are really confortable and help me on my dance posture!"
70589,1,"Love Love Love these, in fact am online trying to find them in another color. Everything hurts my feet, so I usually only buy expensive shoes. I love flip flops and usually wear only Reef & Roxy, but lately they have been too flat or too high, etc. I ran across these and the shape of the sole makes them feel like a real shoe. The real leather strap is super soft too. I have an average size 7 foot and the 7's couldn't fit better."
291784,1,These boots fit my son really well. They are cute and he seems to think they are comfortable because he never wants to take them off. For the price you really can't beat them.
338354,1,No review necessary. They are wheat timbs. The quality n look of these boots from Timberland speak for themselves. :)
186604,1,"Just got this shoe and it's very comfortable, but it's narrower than I expected. I got a medium, as usual, but it's too tight (even without strapping them closed) so a wide would have been better. I'm hoping it will stretch."
88853,1,"I have tried Nike, Reebok, New Balance and every other shoe with my wide foot, but nothing comes close to the 2070. Having just ordered two, that should last me a year or two and I run every day at least two miles. This shoe is the one that they should keep for a long time. Don't buy the later versions when you can stockpile these.FYI, if these are out, I reccomend the New Balance 764 which are also good, although not as good."
104156,1,"I just bought my third pair of these boots in five years. I found them to be almost indestructible for light machine shop and daily use on the street. They are VERY COMFORTABLE, ideal if one is on your feet all day.They also polish up well and are presentable WORN as a dress boot/shoe.They felt like a favorite, comfortable old pair of shoes from the first time I put them on...SORT OF INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH BUNNY SLIPPERS!The boots are very well made from real leather.They are not heavy duty enough for heavy construction,logging or concrete work. Good for light farm work and driving.THEY ARE THE BEST WEARING WORK BOOT, I HAVE FOUND FOR DAY TO DAY WEAR.The soles have some tread, giving you fair traction in the grass, snow and ice plus have excellent wear resistance.Also...the boot's sole patterns does not leave large clumps of the outside on the kitchen floor, while stepping into the house.The boot sizing is pretty much exact. Only buy your exact sizeExcept a WIDER SHOE if you plan to wear multiple pairs of thick socks in the winter.They have an excellent size / width selection. I usually need a 14 EEEEE in a boot.The boots are almost waterproof, you will need to apply a reasonable coat of waterproofing silicone spray or mystery oil leather treatment. KIWI SHOE POLISH makes them shine up very well.The leather uppers are well cut out pattern and sewn together with care.I never had problems with the leather, material, sewn seams splitting or tearing, and no loosening or unusual wear with the heels or soles.The leather is thick enough to protect but still thin enough to be flexible.I have bought both he 6 inch and 8 inch versions of this farm boot.Both boot heights are just as easy to get on and off, however the eight inch high boot does gives you a bit more ankle support.So, I prefer the eight inch height.The only thing I can recommend extra for these boots...Order a bit thicker,round nylon boot laces, instead of the flat, cotton shoe laces that come FACTORY standard with these boots.If you need soles with more traction get something with a VIBRAM sole.However, trust me, your wife will remind you,often, to remove your boots before coming into the house with VIBRAM soles on.The only tougher and better boots I have seen and bought,have been just as happy with, are the White's Smoke Jumper Logging Boots and they COST ALMOST $500.00The FARM BOOTS are a great deal! I wish more American companies made things with this amount of care /pride in the product,a good design philosophy, used quality materials and all put together with wonderful workmanship!The people at WORK AMERICA remind me and hearken back to an earlier time in this country, when something that was stamped AMERICAN MADE or MADE IN USA meant often this product was the best made in the world!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D94HNQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
330215,1,"I had a pair of Rockports years ago and loved them. I'm glad to see the quality and comfort is still there. When I first got the shoe, I didn't think I was going to like it because it was a little lighter in color than I thought, and the toe is a little more square than I am used to. Once I put them on and wore them with a pair of jeans, I was sold. Absolutely love them."
12903,1,"My father in law loves this shoe.I bought him a pair several years ago.He said it was very comfortable and light.So I ordered another pair for him this year.The price is $5 more than few years ago.The quality is still very good.My father in law has got swollen ankel so I ordered him EEE.He likes the slip on shoes because he does not need to tie the shoe laces,which is difficult for a 75 years old."
106937,1,"Sooooo comfy. I brought a pair of these for work as I am a vet nurse and am on my feet all day, but I find I wear them every chance I can (I've since purchased a second pair and have put them away). I also use them to go for my morning walk and get a lot of compliments on them. I recommend these to anyone."

160960,1,"My son loves Chuck Taylor Converse All Stars, and these are so durable! He wanted the high tops this time, so I got these for him. He loves them, and they came so quickly even though it was during Christmas season rush."
272272,1,"This is the third pair of Five Ten Spire shoes that I have owned. They are great for long days on multi-pitch climbs. The leather upper forms to my feet and gives just enough to make a great all day shoe. The four star rating is because they seem to wear a little faster than my other shoes. If you are looking for comfort and performance for an entry level price, this is one shoe to try."
329630,1,"These are possibly the world's best shoes. They're cute, comfortable, and last forever. They have great arch support and the seller shipped them quickly.Thumbs up!"
256108,1,I purchased these shoes before knee replacement surgery. They give you such good balance that I was able to leave the walker and cane and walk on my own much sooner than most patients. The shoes are so comfortable I forget I have them on. I am buying for the future. I do not want to ever be without these shoes.
171159,1,"Uncertain about the size, the free return shipping convinced me to order.So glad I did!Dislike shoelaces so the style was great, so was the look and color . I could wear these every day.Now I just need some great looking socks to wear all year round."

177131,1,Good. Cheap. Classical Chuck Taylor allready. Buy them.Enought comment. Remember to pray for the Converse. Kiss you dude.Bye. k?
39638,0,"I agree with everyone else who has written that these flip-flops are very comfortable and very nice looking. However, I cannot believe how squeaky they are! I'm embarrassed to wear them around my office as you can hear me coming a mile away. Not sure if I just need to wear them in or if they'll be like this forever. Also agree with most everyone else that they run a little small so order a size up to be safe."
82071,1,Excellent fit. made well. would definitely purchase again.I wear a 5 1/2 but since these shoes tend to stretch a little over time i purchased a 5.
336853,1,My granddaughter asked for these at Christmas. She thinks they are awesome and can't wait to wear them to school in the new year.
303642,1,First let me say that i love naughty monkey shoes! nect these shoes are extremely comfortable and even with the high heel. The color is said to be green but is more or less brown with some army green accents. Thank you for another great pair of shoes.
76168,1,"These sandals were just what I was looking for. They were a little tight when they arrived, but have now stretched out just enough. These will be a favorite this summer."

174763,0,"I used to wear this Newport style a lot several years ago. But had forgotten about them until I was searching for some comfortable shoes with support to wear during my third trimester of pregnancy. This pair ended up being too large (slipped in the heel), but I would have returned them even if they had fit because they are too clunky for my style now."
50092,1,This merchant has excellent prices on Pleaser brand shoes and boots. I will always look here first for future Pleaser purchases. The boots came quickly and are exactly how they were described. The boots themselves are gorgeous. Thank you so much!
234921,1,5.11 is good quality. And I was really impressed with the price. I think we have paid more than this for the very same boot.
14681,1,"Years ago, I was walking in a mall somewhere in the US when I first laid eyes on a pair of Havana Joes --- it was these classic oxford design. I thought they were pricey initially but I bought a pair then. They quickly became my favorite midrange shoes --- classy enough to go dining in most resturants wearing chinos and tough enough to go hiking in the woods. Over the years, I've bought Havana Joe Chukkas in both brown and black and Oxfords in brown. The only thing these shoes could not withstand was multiple attacks by my girlfriend's cat on a catnip overdose....argh! (I don't have that girlfriend anymore and I've set out to replace my Havana joes. I recently bought a pair of black oxfords from Amazon prompting this review.Pros:a) Wear like Iron (I have a 5 yr old pair that is still going)b) Look very nicec) Very versatile (from jeans to chinos)d) They come broken in (I think)e) They fit nice (they're a bit wider than most shoes though)Cons:a) They're heavyb) They're so durable that they'll out-endure your feet...so if you walk on hard surfaces all day without a good pair of socks, you will get blisters on your feet...on the other hand, I've played 18 holes of golf with these and no blisters.c) They're getting harder to find...Amazon is one of the few places left in the States that carries Havana Joes.Overall, I can't say enough good things about these shoes. They've been with me across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Thailand, South America ... wherever I go, I take my Havana Joes as my Primary shoes, a pair of sneakers for heavy duty walking, and a pair of flip flops. In my Havana Joes, I feel that my feet are protected trekking across deserts and classy enough to sit down for a 5 course meal including dessert at most restaurants throughout the world. There are very few shoes out there that are this versatile and durable. Another reviewer labeled them ""The Sherman Tank of Dress Shoes,"" and I couldn't agree more. Fantastic product.I'm a big Indiana Jones fan and I just know that Dr. Jones wears Havana Joes both to lecture and on his world adventures and if the civilization ended tomorrow and somebody said, you can only take one pair of shoes, I'd pick my Havana Joes --- because I know they'd last for as long as I lived and would still look good.Get a Pair, Enjoy, and after you own a pair, hope that Amazon continues to carry these fantastic shoes. I bought from Amazon, shipped fast."
124662,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
215384,1,I love these! This is my second pair. I hope they never stop making them.I live in Florida so I wear them everyday.
361040,1,"I have always like Grasshopper shoes and was pleased to see Amazon had a pair that would suit my needs. They arrived promptly, but sad to say, they were the wrong size. I had omitted to notice they were a W width and I have a narrow foot. The cost and trouble of returning them is not worth it, and nobody here that I know of wears a size 11W, so I'm stuck with them."
324731,1,I am in the process of buying myself a pair of puma &quot;Anjan&quot;.
309527,1,"I HATE to spend big bucks on shoes. I know for some, this price point might not be a big deal, but I am ""cheap"" and love the deals. That being said, I had a similar pair of sandals ( Naot) and they wore and wore and wore. I was unable to find the same style, and the Mephisto Helen was almost the exact sandal. As someone else wrote, ""my foot was home."" I have very, very high arches and my feet tend to roll in- this has given me issues with Achilles Tendonitis and more. These sandals hug my feet, support the arch and you do not need to have your toes ""hug"" the shoe to keep them in place. I have only had this sandal for two weeks and am looking for a second pair...and darn if they are not out of my size! lol Shoes are an investment in your health and comfort. Well worth the price you pay for these!"
222650,1,I love these shoes. They look sexy and they are so comfortable. They go with many different outfits. Love em.
218942,1,"This shoes are legendary, not really too much to say about them. You know it, I know it,.. They're back, more than ever.. get yours now. Confy as the most expensive snickers out there."
92108,1,"Five reviews and no one mentioned that these shoes are vinyl. They are made by Croc, btw. If you want non-leather, these are quite comfortable and look good."
121495,1,"I'm starting my fourth pair of this shoe. I've been running for just over three years and have run over 3900 miles in that time, including four marathons. (Plenty of higher-mileage runners out there, please value my opinion accordingly.)I previously wore the Asics gel 1120 and prefer it over this shoe. The 1120 was better looking and more comfortable. There's nothing wrong with this shoe, however.I have two pairs of the GT 2110 that have about 400 miles on them, and a new pair with only 8 miles of wear. There is a big difference in the level of support/cushion. This shoe doesn't seem to age as well as the gel 1120. Still, I've ran roughly 1300 miles in GT 2110s and can attest to their quality.If you have ""normal"" feet (do a foot test online), don't waste your money on hundred-dollar shoes, buy these."
148719,0,I thought the 3 straps were all velcro. What is the use to a disabled person of a shoe that is almost impossible to put on unaided? They are very comfortable for walking but I have reservations about their lasting quality..
141011,1,"Just what you expect - the classic. I got black leather for $15, so it's hard to complain. I subtracted one star because I find them smaller than expected - I wear a 10, ordered a 10, and they are a touch too small (length) for a clog. Not bad enough that I bothered to exchange them, but if I got another pair, I'd get a half-size bigger."
24128,1,"Great conservative work shoe! Comfortable, as a reliable lounger with a pop of style. The color goes with browns and burgundy's, perfectly!"
301404,1,"Shipped very quickly, received in two days. Run slightly big. Heavy-duty high quality. Great boots for boys. Might be able to wear next year, too."
331602,1,"In recent months, I've developed severe neuropathy in my feet and legs. The pain, discomfort and other issues caused by this problem made it painful even wearing socks! Since I couldn't wear shoes -- not even my well-worn-in Birkies which were enough to put me into tears -- and, as a consquense, I pretty much becam a shut in. I took up a friend's offer to use her Crocs. I forgot I had the shoes on and considered crying &lt;g> when asked to return them!"
124813,1,These are my first pair of runners as i graduated from walking for my workout.They have been a good support and my feet never hurt.
22255,0,"The shoes themselves are nice looking, but you definately feel the cheapness of the material. The synthetic leather material isn't as soft or pliable as real leather, making the shoes less comfortable than a more expensive shoe of the same look. The sole of the shoe also feels a bit dead, and flat. More cushioning is pretty much needed if you do more than sit on a chair. For the price, its a decent deal. But it would really be worth the cost to go for something a bit more comfortable. Probably last you longer too."
213010,1,I received my Scout Sandal very quickly. It was in perfect shape and fit just like was supposed to.I am very pleased with the service and the product.
305480,1,"I have owned many Rockport shoes over the years, but these are the first from the Prowalker line I have purchased. I bought them from Amazon's sister company, Zappos. Normally, I wear size 14 but the Prowalkers in 14 were definitely too small, so I ended up with size 15 and those fit fine.I did quite a bit of walking (and driving) in the Prowalkers and they never gave me a problem - comfortable and no irritation from rubbing. The appearance is a bit dressier than most walking shoes, which is exactly what I wanted as I wore them to customer meetings and will wear them on a European vacation later this year.Clearly it is too soon to know about reliability, but I will be sure to update this review should my opinions change."
205825,2,"I purchased these knowing they would fit because I had a pair in another color, but I was wrong they were at least 1/2of a size too large. I returned them but had to pay the postage. I feel like that is unfair because they were sized wrong."
109468,1,I have a very picky daughter when it comes to clothing... We went all over the place looking for some new shoes for school... She couldn't find anything that she liked so when I got home I gave her Amazon.com and had her look here.... She quickly picked these shoes and I ordered them.... They arrived three days later and she loves them.....Not one complaint!
61465,1,Great boots. Quick response. Will be ordering more. I have been wearing this product for many years and love them.
5120,1,"You cant go wrong with Chucks. I have been wearing them for the passed year out here in Afghanistan. They hold up nicely in the rough terrain and keep my feet cool during the summer months when the temperature reaches 130 F degrees. When I am back in the states, I wear pencil skirts and pumps to the office but I will never outgrow Chucks. I wear them on the weekends during coffee runs or for grocery shopping."
116339,1,"I am providing an update to a negative experience I expressed in a previous review about this vendor. The vendor called me today to discuss my concerns. After our discussions, I felt extremely satisfied, that he is truly focused on his customers and provides a quality service. My situation was rectified and I am extremely satisfied and would not hesitate to order again from this vendor. It is wonderful to still have people who care about their product, reputation and their customer base"
67224,1,"These are approach shoes not hiking shoes -meaning they're at their best running around rocks and boulders, not on just dirt trails (note tread - designed for gripping on a relatively smooth rock surface, not knobby like a trail runner). Toe box is on the narrow side like a climbing shoe. I like these a great deal for scrambling around places like Joshua Tree. I can climb up to mid 5s with them. Better smearing than edging. Had them 2 years and still holding up but now looking for a new pair. Highly recommended."
52318,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
303821,0,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
110553,1,"These boots are gorgeous however I definitely have the sausage effect because of my calves. I don't think I'm stocky. Nonetheless, I can't bear to return them because they are so beautiful. I'm hoping that my legs will get thinner one day and i'll be able to wear them."
121181,1,"My feet and arches were hurting a lot. After a few days in your shoes the pain went away. Whenver, my feet start to ache, I wear the shoes and they feel much better. Excellent support and comfort, I also bought 1/2 size larger and wear thicker sox. I will probably buy them again. Great quality for the money."
77950,1,they do a really good job; fast shipping and the item was in very good condition i give them 6 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!
32722,1,"these shoes were very comfy for me. i had them for 2 season (high school then aau) no matter what size you are, if u have wide feet...these are the shoes for you. there comfy dont worry about the looks. they're light and you will never sprain or twist your ankles.hope this helps a little"
90476,1,These shoes have tons of support and breathing room. I use them for running and I really like them!
105484,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
90940,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
194816,1,When i saw these spikes i knew they were for me as they look and now feel comfortable but keep the precision which a runner needs upon the track. The responsive feel and the good looks make this pair of spikes the 'cream of the crop' and since ive had them all my training partners keep staring at my feet.
204970,1,"I have used these in my cross country ski boots for the past year. We live in Alaska and it was cold last winter. They really helped, and they did not slip in my boots at all. I am 63 and my feet get cold fairly easily any more, and these helped me stay out and ski in 0 and below temperatures."
383114,1,"I previously owned a pair of these sandals (over 5 years ago) which I really liked, but for some reason they no longer fit confortably. I decided to order them in a wide width thinking that might be the problem now that I no longer wear high heels, but more casual, loose fitting shoes. My new sandals fit beautifully. I can wear them all day long in complete comfort. I'm really glad I gave them a second try because I really like the style and have always thought them to be an attractive shoe too."
326855,1,"The GT-2100 from Asics is a phenomenal shoe. It provides the best support of any stability shoe around, and has been voted the best running shoe in the World by Runner's World. Though not made for heavy over-pronaters, this is a fantastic shoe for those who do not or just slightly over-pronate. It also provides fantastic supposrt for those with weaker ankles or knees. An all-around fantastic piece of equipment."
356903,0,"I purchased a white pair of Keds tennis shoes recently. When they arrived, they looked wonderful and fit like a glove...I just loved them! After a week or so, they needed washed, so I put them in the washing machine with a load of whites and used cold water and a name brand laundry detergent. Imagine my surprise when I removed them from the washer to air dry, and discovered they were now a light blue color! Evidently the dark, royal blue foot liner 'bleeds'. It looks like I have a blue pair of Keds tennis shoes now..."
25419,1,I had been looking at these shoes for a while but the price was a little much... So waiting paid off!!! These shoes fit perfect they have a great arch and if they are working out my legs and bottom I can't tell!! Thats how comfortable they are!! I own another pair of sandals from earth and am looking to get a pair of boots.. Thanks Amazon
135993,0,i think that this sneaker was a bit tight but otherwise a good buy. waiting to procure a similar item.
217579,1,"I have been wearing Chucks since I came out of the womb. I've been through many pairs, and after I decided to retire my old black ones due to a blown out heel I wanted to go with something new. The white is really an eye catching color, and more subdued in person than some of the pictures out there. BE WARNED, Chucks are about a size bigger than your actual shoe size. For example I wear a size 7 in women's, which would be a size 5 in Chucks, but these are really too big so I went with the size 4. I find the white adds some contrast, especially if you wear dark colors like I do."
357711,1,I am normally a 7 so i ordered an 8 and yes these shoes are pretty slippery but you can buy stickers that you can put at the bottom of the shoe! i love them and think they were a very good price
382916,1,This is a great sneaker in any color. Narrow is pretty narrow however. You can not go wrong with this shoe.
209310,1,"The Angioline Liberty Flats are available in numerous colors for a reason. The comfort, fit, quality, and appearance can't be beaten. No matter what you wear, there's a color of shoes to match, and they always look nice. I have many people ask me where I buy my shoes, and I'm more than happy to tell them. I recommend The Shoe Mall, and Angioline shoes to anyone who'll listen."
184965,1,"I have been wearing Softwalk brand for many years. This is a very comfortable slip-on with padding in all the right places. I also have the Jupiter style. This particular pair felt a little tight at first but that is because my old pair are so worn and stretched out. You should try them on with the thickest socks that you intend to wear with them. These are definitely worth the money for the quality, and Amazon's price is better than anywhere else."
321002,0,"I received my 9.5 N ballet shoes today. Before ordering, I measured my foot from tip of big toe to end of heel.Using that number, I decided to go a half size larger ""just in case"" some of the people who warned ""too small"" were talking about my kind of foot. Well, the shoes are even too small at half a size larger!! I always buy athletic shoes one whole size longer. If I buy these again, I will do that---so if you wear a 9, get a 10! The ballet shoes have the curved toe, and that design makes the big toe land on one of the short curved sides...well, mine anyway. Also, I have a very narrow heel, and they are too big in the heel...so too short and too wide a heel if you need a narrow size. However, I will keep them and maybe order a size 10N. Do measure your foot standing on a tape measurer, and to whatever size it says to get in the measurement instructions add one full size. I want to kick myself! : kkp"
105341,2,"This has been a very unpleasant e-commerce buying experience. It has changed my mind about purchasing some items on line. I ordered some Roper boots from Bargain Outfitters. They came in a timely manner, when I tried them on they did not fit me. I decided to send them back immediately and because there was no address other than the one on the box and it was the same on the paper insert that was given to me, that is where I sent it back. I sent it UPS ground and it was delivered the next day. That was 3 weeks ago. I am still waiting for my refund because they are busy and can't get around to finding this box and refunding my money. I am wondering if I will ever receive a refund and what my recourse is going to be."
12549,1,"Just what you would expect if you owned a pair of these 10, 20, 30 years ago, except with a custom peace sign logo on the outside only.They do sure highlight however just how far shoe technology has come by comparison to a pair of ASICS running shoes - in terms of support, comfort etc. They are 30 year old or more shoe technology.I hoped that logo would be on both sides but the inseam side of the shoe bears the traditional converse chuck taylor logo.Still, 5 stars from my view. They are what they are supposed to be."
364329,1,I love my chuck Taylors. They go well with Jeans or almost anything that I want to wear. Looking to buy the Chocolate next.
38844,1,I'm on my feet all day as a Central office tech. My work has me crawling on the floor to climbing ladders.I've bought 3 pairs of these shoes in multiple colors because they give my feet support and protections. There is also enough room in the shoe to add orthotics which has helped my lower back.
76247,1,"Nice stable shoe. I did have to take them to have heel tips put on as they don't come with any, cost was $10 at my shoe repair. I wanted a pair of basic black shoes with leather soles without paying a fortune for them. I can't believe what we have to go through to find women's shoes with leather soles anymore. Ridiculous. But these worked out nice. I can wear them on the street and if an opportunity to dance comes up, I can dance in them as well. I did order them in a wide (I normally wear medium) since many reviewers stated they run tight. I'm glad I did, they fit perfectly and are very comfortable for walking or dancing."
385699,1,"Love them, I get lots of compliments when I wear them. Loved them so much I had to buy a pair for my daughter."
343646,1,"I like black sneakers best because you can pull them off going to casual social things like neighborhood parties, cookouts, etc. and they dont look dumpy.these are comforatable and break in nicely."
132269,1,"Got a picky little critter who thinks she's dancing for the Moscow Ballet...She loves these. Comfortable, good quality and look good."
371893,1,"I must say that a large part of the glowing review I'm about to give is due to the color of my shoes, which, incidentally, is not shown among the dozen or so variants available here. My pair of 574's are mostly black, with light grey ""N"" logos stitched on, a white strip above the sole, white portions by the top lace eyelets, and a PALE YELLOW rear ""kick guard"" or whatever you'd like the call the plastic strip on the back. This particular combo looks killer, and I don't see it here.But I digress... Typically, when one goes to buy a casual sneaker, they have two things in mind: Looks and comfort. Sometimes, comfort even comes AFTER looks if you are really bent on your appearance. Versatility and longevity are OFTEN not primary factors. It's a street sneaker; you aren't looking for high-end sprinting performance to rival Usain Bolt, or the ability to wade through crocodile-infested swamps while silently pursuing a band of ruthless mercenaries.The New Balance 574 delivers soundly in both leading categories of looks and comfort. For the first 20 minutes of wearing them and strolling around, I was alarmed by the awkward feeling they provided, as with every pair of new shoes (particularly New Balance) that I have bought. This quickly subsided as my feet readily accustomed to the shoes, and now they feel like part of my body. So...comfort, check.And the LOOKS... When I first stumbled across the 574, I had frankly gotten sick of the typical shoe design--lots of cheap ""synthetic uppers"" made of whatever synthetic material it is they use, and ""bling"" in the form of gaudy, glued-on plastic trash that usually peeled off after a few weeks and contributed a frenetic, busy appearance reminiscent of a Jackson Pollock painting. The 574 does away with this nonsense. First off, forget what cliches may exist for suede shoes (especially blue ones), the suede used for the uppers on these is MUCH nicer than the typical ""synthetic"" [material]. In addition, the shoe is simple (at least mine are, with only neutral tones) and lacks glued-on tidbits, meaning that you won't be leaving a trail of spare parts behind you once the shoes age a bit. The big ""N"" logos scream ""retro"" and I think they look pretty cool. I see a lot of folks wearing New Balance shoes, and although all of them are pretty good quality, mine seem unique and a step above the typical ""generic"" style.But wait, there's more! So they are comfortable, and look the part. What about those ""bonus"" features? Well, I haven't gone on a mercenary pursuit lately, but I can say that I jog, cycle, exercise, walk around the kitchen, go to class, go to work, drive, and push cars with these things...no problem. What's more, and this is entirely true, I rode a camel up Mt. Sinai (yes, THE Mt. Sinai in Egypt, and yes, a CAMEL) and then walked all the way back down...in these shoes. And they LITERALLY look ""none the worse for the wear."" Seriously, they aren't high-traction hiking shoes, so I slipped a bit on the gravel (though proud to say I never FELL) and these shoes didn't have a mark on them afterward.Moral of the story? If you like suede, retro-ish, comfortable, durable, and generally great shoes that don't require a trip to the loan officer at your local bank, then don't hesitate to buy the New Balance M574 sneakers. They really are that good."
368617,1,"I really love my Havaianas fitflops!! I wore it when we went to south Carolina for summer vacation.. and its really comfortable to my feet. And I like the color, you can match it in any color of your short. It flatters my feet :) I really recommend this product"
86569,1,"Propet Women's Breeze Walker SandalI have n't bought many shoes on line, but I actually had tried on this model while shopping a few weeks earlier. However I couldn't imagine how luxuriously comfortable it would be. I am wearing it everywhere - church, work, shopping - it's that comfortable. They are also very lightweight and easily wiped off. And they were ten dollars cheaper than at the ""outlet"" store where I was shopping. What a bargain."
575,1,"The person I purchased them for feel they are very comfortable. I was worried at first with buying boots from on line, but it turned out ok."
175552,1,I now own five pairs!!! All in different colors! Hope they never stop selling them!
209161,1,"My new Topsiders have a better initial fit than all my previous pairs. I guess being produced in China has slightly changed the dimensions, in my case to the better.This pair is the two-toned version (brown & black) which are best for traveling as they will go with any color clothing. They used to have another travel advantage as after 9/11 they were the only pair of shoes you didn't have to remove at airport security. The TSA folks knew they had no arch support and wouldn't set off the metal detectors. Unfortunately, during the last year the TSA now insist all shoes go through the x-ray machine.I have owned many pair in the past several decades including the Gold Cup (which are the most comfortable with the best support - although a bit pricey) and this is the first pair that make my feet black when not wearing socks. Evidently, the dye they are now using is not colorfast. They have not been wet or worn on the water yet, they have only been worn in an urban environment. Hopefully, with age they will stop bleeding.Otherwise, if they can correct the dye problem, they appear to be well constructed even though they are now made in China."
84140,1,"I need a dress shoes without heels due to a bad back. These shoes were sold out at the local shoe, but Amazon saved the day! A perfect fit with soft leather uppers and patent leather toe and heel, goes perfectly with pants or skirts. The very first time I purchased shoes online and it was a success!"
194552,1,"I ordered this shoe in white, I was very skeptical because of the price, but I was not disappointed, they were comfortable I loved them they set my black bubble dress off, I got tons of compliments. LOVE these shoes I will be ordering 2 more pair of them the red and the black"
166048,1,"I bought my puma's on amazon like 4 years ago, before everyone else started wearing them. I can't stand big giant basketball shoes with velcro, and springs that look like space boots. If you want nice casual kicks you need to get some pumas. They have tons of cool colors and you can't go wrong with black. Who doesn't love these."
164300,2,"They're cheap, what can I say?Cheaply made.No padding for your feet. NONE.Need to break them in or they'll scrape the bejesus out of your heels.The strap seriously hurts your foot too.Payless.com is now making platforms by.. Brash, I think. They're much better quality and cheaper as well."
147128,1,I followed the recommendation of ordering down 1 full size on this boot. I did that just like the slippers but that is not the case on these. I recommend ordering your true size. Other than the size issue I returned and went to the store and bought them there as I was going away and could not wait for them to be replaced. Ugg is truly a great product and again boots order your true size....Just my opinion. : ) Happy Feet
334355,1,Happy to locate these shoes at such a great price & in my size. A replacement for a well-worn pair. Thanks.
169022,0,i'm somewhat like the other reviewer...these shoes are beautiful but your feet slide in them..i would recommend getting those sole inserts to prevent this from happen...my cousin has a pair and agree to this and the shoes are absolutely wearable with beauty
93961,2,"My wife has owned numerous pairs of these sneakers over the past ten years. When she received her latest pair, it was obvious that manufacturing standards had changed. These 61/2 d's were much smaller than prior 6 1/2 ds. The shoe was not as wide nor was it as long. Quality control very poor."
20181,1,"My husband has an injury to his heel that requires him to wear shoes with excellent support. These shoes fit the bill....and Amazon had the best price! These shoes usually run from $99 to $119, and they have to be replaced (in this case) every three to four months. So I have to find the best price I can. They will last alot longer for the average person...fit is great, style, materials too."
188852,1,"Bought a pair of men's 10 1/2 in mid 2009. Don't hike as much as I used to so had only used them 4 times by Aug 2012 when the sole came off the heel of one. Way out of Asolo's 1 yr warranty. Still, because the boots showed almost no wear, I contacted Asolo and explained the situation. They immmediately arranged for a complete sole replacement. Had to pay shipping one way to their cobbler, but the repair and return shipping was at no cost to me. Kudos to Asolo for standing behind their product. This was clearly a material or workmanship defect, not a wear issue. In fact, all Asolo wanted to know was where and when I had bought them, then they approved the repair. Makes me suspect perhaps they knew of a bad lot that was prone to failure. Doesn't matter, they fixed the problem.Otherwise, I have found these boots to be very comfortable with almost no break in required. I've done a fair bit of hiking in rough country over the years, a lot of it in the Whites of NH. The cushioning provided by the Asolo sole systems really makes a difference. These boots give good support for backpacking in rough country and are light for the support they provide. A top notch product. I would have rated them 5 stars if they had not suffered the sole separation. However, Asolo gets 5 stars for repairing them."
274088,1,"I owned several of these back in the day, and they still stand as one of most comfortable shoes of that era."
137839,0,"This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
65035,1,I have worn Keds for over 50 years and I love them. The last pair I had had something different about the instep that wasn't as comfortable as usual but his pair is wonderful! I like them because they're not bulky like a lot of the sneakers out there now!
261342,1,"I didn't notice the buckle when I ordered, but the shoe fits so well that the little extra time involved doesn't bother me at all. I ordered it in red (not a bright true red, but toned-down - think medium rust with touch of pink and chocolate). It will go with most things in my closet. Propet is a wonderful shoe - I have a similar sandal in tan with two velcro straps and a closed back (a ""tennis shoe"" sandal), and a boot with 2"" heel. All are very comfortable - at this age, the most important detail in footwear!"
290525,1,"After one or two weeks of break in period,these rockport prowalkers are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had,bar none. This includes any top of the line running shoes I've had such as New Balance. Ecellent value and comfort! Can't beat it!"
288705,0,"I didn't realize that this was more of a winter boot rather than a year-round boot. The lining is a bit heavy (nice and warm for winter), but I don't think I'll be wearing these boots past March. They are comfortable enough, though - maybe a bit higher than I would have liked."
19118,0,"The shoes run large so order a half-size lower than normal. They just didn't fit right on my Mom, she was really disappointed. Usually Easy Spirit is more true to size."
6507,1,"Sperry Top-Sider Men's Nautical Billfish 3-Eye Boat Shoe, The third pair in about 12 yrs. I wear the heck out of them and they wear great and are confortable. Highly recommend them"
220371,1,"I like these shoes very much, i have bought over 12 pairs of shoes from amazon, and these rank in my top 3 pairs. Very white, very easy to keep clean. I have wide feet, and these are not tight at all."
25785,1,These shoes are really comfortable and look really nice too. I'd definitely recommend them. They are the first new balance shoes I've gotten and I think my next pair will be New Balance too :)
332863,1,These are authorized for military to wear at my deployed location and they are comfortable and convienent to and from the DFAC and bathroom. I wear my crocs as much as possible to help air out my feet. I wear them to the pool as well as when I take a shower. Mad props to these crocs.
18484,1,"I like the adidas +10.7's because they are very light and durable and they are also very comfortable on the feet. You get very good traction,I haven't slipped for the time that i have had them they are great in wet and dry conditions. I would deffinatly recomend these for soccer."
145513,1,"I have some Ugg slippers in this same Bomber Jacket Chestnut and I liked the color so well that I looked to see if they made the boots in the same color. Lo and behold, I found them here on Amazon and ordered the ""tall"" ones. They are certainly different than the usual Ugg colors and I like them very much! Of course, they are comfy and cozy as all Uggs seem to be!"
136091,1,"I have been wearing these shoes for most of my life. They aren't $15. anymore, but they are still worth the money. They are very flat, so don't forget to get some insoles with arches for them! You may want to add 1/2 a shoe size for this."
335822,1,"Most Comfortable shoes in the planet, yet the ugliest. I wear Crocs every day to work and every single day of my life. Watch my Crocs video review on You Tube. Here is the link. [...]"
318678,1,"These are nice shoes, and seem to be well made. They are comfortable right out of the box. The only issue I had was that I ordered two pairs, one black and one brown, both in 6 1/2 EEE (the size I normally wear). The black ones were true-to-size and fit me just fine. The brown ones, although marked the same size, were a whole size too big. I sent them back and ordered the brown shoes in a 6 EEE and they now fit just as well as the black ones that are 6 1/2 EEE. It seems there is a size difference between the colors, with the brown ones running a whole size bigger than marked."

212281,1,"I recently retired my ASICS 1110s after racking up 300 miles. These shoes are by far the best value for runners!I used to wear Nike, but read in Runner's World Magazine that the ASICS 1100 was the Editor's Choice for best overall running shoe, so I thought, why not? In the past I've dealt with shin splints, knee pain and plantar facitis (a.k.a. sore feet), but my ASICS 1100s kept me healthy and comfortable, and relatively stylish.I now own ASICS Kayano running shoes, which cost $135 - considerably more than the 1100s - and truthfully, I find no difference between the two pair of running shoes except for the price.I ran about 15 - 20 miles per week in these shoes, enjoying superior comfort. If you run short or medium distances (&lt;25 miles per week), this is the shoe for you."
84690,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
268208,1,So comfortable and cute! Great quality and about $15 less than dept stores.(Probably not good for someone w/ a high arch)
210480,1,6 N is a hard to find shoe size. This white sandal was perfect in every way. It's exactly what I was looking for !!
249760,1,Im make my purchase without any trouble at all and I recived my product on time.
194845,1,These were bought as a gift for when it's time to transition to a larger size. I also bought the small blue pair for now. They also appear to be well made.
274641,1,I bought these for my boys for Christmas and they love them so much they refuse to take them off. They told me these are the best pair of shoes/boots they have ever had.
127739,0,Lusted after these before buying. But they turned out to be too stiff and shiny to be a good addition to my wardrobe. Alas.
201616,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
246471,1,"These are very good and comfortable basketball shoes. The added shock absorbtion, especially in the forefoot helps alleviate a lot of sore foot issues. However, these shoes have been discontinued for the year (the new style will ship before next basketball season) and are now selling for $59.99 in stores."
96509,1,"These cleats didnt take any breaking in at all...Never had a blister. This is my second pair...the elather is soft, which is why they are so easy to break in, and comfort is great. One down side is the toe part will split after some time...but I am tough on my cleats. I love that you can change out the insert and make them a super lightweight cleat too. I recommend this shoe!"
55516,0,"Bought white Keds for my daughter. She loves them, but after just 4 weeks they are showing structural wear and tear. They were only $20, so not over the top expensive, but I remember when Keds lasted for multiple seasons so I guess I am nostalgic..."
261469,1,"Converse All Stars, a classic. Love them. They're very comfortable and they're perfect for a night at the movies or just hanging out with the guys.Obviously they do not have much support or cushion (and I wasn't expecting any). If I was going to be on my feet all day or doing something real active this is not the shoe I would choose.Tilly's service was fantastic. I couldn't be more pleased."
280964,1,"I wear Ked sneakers always and I was over joyed to find this show at such a low price. It is just as expected, great quality and reliable shoe!"
190369,0,"Bought these for a white school uniform shoe. It is narrow at the ball of the foot, completely straight where your foot would be widest. Might want to consider a wide width or one size larger, even if you don't normally need wide. Seems to hold up well to wear. Leather in good condition."
172193,1,"I loved my shoes, brand new, in box, great product, fast shipping. Thanks so much!"
212304,1,"These boots took a little longer to break in but, is was well worth the time. They are really comfortable and sturdy. I wear them for construction work boots and hiking. The only boots I have liked better were a pair of Asolo's. They were 3 times the price though. I think the Frontier Peak GTX is a great boot for the price and I have bought a lot of boots over the last 38 years."
339440,0,"For the price these were good converse that lasted a little over a year and a half (I wore them a lot). The one thing I noticed is that when they arrived they smelled like spray paint and over time as the black faded it started to look like a dark green. Not that bad, but something to take into consideration."
254518,1,My grown daughter always preferred K-Swiss so I knew this would be a good fit for my grandson.They are true to size and fit great. He loves them.
358782,0,"These will do the job on small scuffs and everyday wear and tear marks. Just dont expect them to much more. After trying to remove a few light marks from grease or mud, i found these to be ineffective. They are only ok at some of these types of marks. I would recommend for light wear but these just dont cut it for anything more intense."
79346,1,Sweeet!...my boy is flipping over these. He wants to wear them everywhere - I drew the line at church.
176667,1,My loves these boots and he always ask me to buy this product because it really stands up to it's name.
148227,1,First time shoe buyer via internet. Purchased because I'd worn Propet before and was pleased with fit. Not disappointed! The fit was perfect and shoes delivered in a timely way.
156587,1,"Love em' the heel with platform make boot/shoe feel just right. Only one draw back you tend to get a greyish rim around the leg where the boot ends. But the look is awesome and the boots fit and feel comfortable. And the price? sheesh! buy em' OH, they tend to run a little on the big size. I usually wear 8.5 and these leave a ittle room. Would I of gone for an 8? I don't know I don't like my boots too snug either. So in the end I was ok with the fit. $20!! yipppeee"
238845,1,I bought the hot pink in this in a size 5- and it was exactly that- hot pink but with a black lining. I like it alot. It's worth the price.
260798,1,These are awsome. just like shown. shipping took a while but it was over christmas so it makes sense. Just as nice as the pictures showed! Love the new CHucks
368324,1,"These are the best sandals I've tried in years! They are comfortable and stylish - and at a good price! I took them with me on my trip and they were perfect! I wore them on the beach, into shops, all over and they were very comfortable. I did buy another pair - a little higher heal, a platform and they were just as comfortable. Would definately buy these again, but don't know which color I would choose... hard decisions! :)"
151678,1,"These are absolutely the most comfortable and lightweight shoes I have ever worn. I have these in several colors, and will continue to buy them. The only thing that I would change is to make the white on the soles the same color as the rest of the shoe, but the only time that has prevented me from buying the shoe is when looking for black shoes to wear as part of a uniform."
166014,0,I purchased these shoes because I have a hard time finding my size 5. I have purchased these before through another place and they seemed to be more comfortable and softer inside. I can only wear these for a short time before my feet start to hurt and I have to remove them.
217217,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
293950,1,Works great outside and at the climbing gym. Very comfortable. This shoe stretches more than the La Sportiva Cliff model. Normally wear a Cliff 43 that's tight and went with a Mythos 42.5. I fit the shoe with my toes slightly curled/slightly uncomfortable. (I have the kind of feet with the longer second toe.) The shoe stretched to a tight fit after a total of about 15 hrs of climbing at the gym. I'm confident they'll fit perfect in a short amount of time. I'd buy them again.
340639,1,Converse chuck Taylor lo top awesome and extremely fast shipper fit perfect what more can one sat they are a classic
337261,1,I'm on my feet for about 6 hours a day and love these boots. I'm on my second pair and have been very happy with both.
321801,0,These shoes looked like they would be so comfortable. I was disappointed w/ the fit. I bought a competitor's shoe that I love instead.
367810,1,"I have ordered 4 pairs ofthese shoes, in the past 6months. They are very comfortable.I would recommend them to anyone,"
16418,1,"Excelent!, hard to football and soft to my feet XD... great quality ass adidas always do, durable and exactly like my needs."
109127,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
239674,1,"I have a 6+ year old pair of the guide tennies and have really enjoyed them but they are too worn for serious trips so I thought to buy a new pair. After reading the mixed reviews here I was questioning myself but went ahead and bought them anyhow. They do fit a bit more snug than my old pair but once I loosened the strings around the toe area they fit just great. I did 4 seperate, 3 mile warmup hikes with them and they remained comfortable out of the box. This past weekend I used them to approach and climb a 9,400' peak. It was close to 12 miles car to car, 13,000 feet of elevation gain and loss. Snow and wet rock on the mountain, rain on the descent. These shoes had no problems on the wet granite and remained comfortable even soaked from the rain. There has been no delamination of the soles that others have mentioned. Possibly people were climbing in extreme heat when they experienced that. I wholly recommend them."
133004,1,"I purchased these boots in size 8.5 in Russet Rebel. I'm usually a perfect 8.5, but they were really large on the bridge of my feet and huge on my calves (I've heard that cowboy boots are supposed to be looser on your calves than other boots, but this was extreme), so I returned them for an 8, which has worked well. They were a little stiff at first (which was not surprising, as they're leather), but they've loosened up nicely after a day or two of wear. They're cute, and I've worn them so far with jeans and with a skirt and tights. Fun, cute boots, and I really like the stitching."
22121,1,"First time I tried on Clarks. Very nice looking shoe. Extremely comfortable right out of the box. Soft leather, padding below the ankles very soft. Only problem was the sizing is generous. Have to return the shoes but ordered one half size smaller. Liked them to much not to try again."
160579,1,"This pair of converse was just what I expected; they were one my son's Christmas presents. The colors available were more varied than those I'd seen in local stores and the price was better. This item arrived sooner than promised, too. Needless to say, my son was pleased."
207172,1,"My DH has worn Clark oxfords for some time and says they are the best fitting and most comfortable shoes he has ever owned. This new pair of Clarks, the Citadel Oxford, is his new favorite because it is light weight, casual, and so comfortable."
40571,0,"These flip flops are not the same as the Reef GINGER flip flops I bought a couple years ago and still use. There is not as much arch support as my old pair and they feel kind of like cheap styrofoam soles. I'm still going to wear them, but if you are buying these to replace an older pair... they are not the same. On the positive, they are true to size. I wear a size 8 and they fit."
90297,1,"They are snug and luxurious. The height is terrific for completely warming the ankle for someone like me with poor circulation. Compared to lessor cost ones, there is no comparison as these are excellent and well made."
319441,1,"Great service from Amazon as always. The shoes are sweet, comfortable, and the inner lining is so pretty. The only issue I found was that they are bigger than expected. I had to exchange for a smaller size and the sides of the shoes still hang off my feet rather than sitting snug, but for the price, not a bad shoe."
122132,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
216121,1,"Several years ago I had problems running to include back pain and shin splints and was limited to running 2 or 3 miles at a time. I absolutely hated running, and I attribute this to ill-fitting shoes. After lots of searching for a new pair of shoes, I was recommended a pair of New Balance shoes...can't remember the exact model, but it was a predecessor to the 856. Within a year, I was able to run 2 half-marathons and a full marathon. These shoes eliminated all complications...great for my overpronation and low arches. I have ordered 2 or 3 pairs at a time, paying up to $100 for them. Amazon's deal of $39.99 is a steal...I was told by another shoe dealer that this model was discontinued back in the spring. Good to see they're still available."
263117,1,The shoes were in excellent quality and the size and the color were correct. Very good product. I am very happy with my purchase.
118406,0,The shoes were not true to size. I would recommend ordering a smaller size than the actual shoe size. I followed what everyone else said by ordering the bigger size and in all actuality i should have ordered her correct size or even a size smaller. Other than that they seem to have been great shoes.
187584,0,"Of all the croc models I've tried, the Mary Janes rate as my absolute favorites! I find them amazingly comfortable, and now have them in 2 different colors which I wear all the time. The pulse red, however was a major disappointment since despite its name, it is not red at all, but an orangey melon color. Wasn't worth returning, so I gave them away as I would never wear that color. Too bad the color wasn't clearer."
83055,0,"I loved the look of these shoes, but comfort wise they leave much to be desired. they are very hard and thin soled (which is why they look cute), but i cant imagine walking much distance on cement in them, much less running.they are good everyday type shoes but not for anything athletic.(the ones I tried are true to size, but diff colors do apparently run differently)"
286048,1,THESE BOOTS ARE GREAT! I GOT THE DARK BROWN COLOR AND THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING. VERY COMFORTABLE AND KEEP MY FEET WARM ALL DAY. ORDERING WAS EASY AND I RECEIVED MY BOOTS IN A WEEK.
341282,2,WOW! I've worn these for many years. I can't believe that they are now made of plastic. I'll be looking for anything else.
37102,0,"Bought white Keds for my daughter. She loves them, but after just 4 weeks they are showing structural wear and tear. They were only $20, so not over the top expensive, but I remember when Keds lasted for multiple seasons so I guess I am nostalgic..."
168127,0,"It's a great shoe with a great design. Feels comfortable over all, however the front of the shoe rubs on the top of my big toe and has caused a blister of sorts. I believe this is due to the design of the shoe being somewhat restricted in the front with little room for my toes to feel comfortable which ends up with the top of the shoe rubbing on it constantly after a long days work. This causes mild comfort issues and if I could return it I would (problem came about after 4-5 day usage)."
297512,1,"First I like the boots, but I have calf's that are larger than 14""s. That is why I ordered a lager size. They fitted fine, but when I was removing them the zippers got jammed and on one I had to destroy the zipper to get it off and the other I was able to remove with the zipper still jammed. I whish they made a boots that are not all the way to below the knee. I do superhero costumes and I like the range of colors they have. I would to liked to know more information on getting boots for a larger calf's I am not the only person that has this problem and now I may have to order a second pair of boots to replace the ones that got damaged."
354015,1,"GREAT BOOT FOR A GREAT PRICE,THE LOWEST PRICE AND BEST QUALITY ON THE NET.WOULD DEFINETLY BUY AGAIN.THANKS AGAIN FOR A GREAT SITE."
68140,1,"I have tried expensive tennis shoes and other so called nursing shoes... these are by far the most comfortable shoes!!! If you spend hours on your feet doing patient care, you need to try these. I think you will agree."
88529,1,"These sandals are great. The heel is not too high, true to size and very comfortable. Can be dressy or casual."
83703,1,This is a really great sandal. I have bought them in the past and have found them to be very comfortable. Not like regular flip flops. The narrow strap makes them very fashionable along with the many colors they come in. After wearing them for awhile they seem to mold to your foot shape. What I like most about them is they have a built in arch which is great for people like me who have a low arch or are flatfooted. Also the price at Amazon.com is a great buy compared to what I have payed for them in the past at other places.
327416,1,"I got these for $29.99. Amazon had problems with shipping them on time and they gave me a $20 gift certificate. So it worked out to be a great deal for me. Anyways, these are really comfortable shoes and the styling is just awesome. I wear them to work pretty much every day. I think it goes well with casual and semi-casual dressup."
322023,1,These shoes definitely run one whole size smaller than you normally wear. I didn't listen to the previous reviews and only got a 1/2 size bigger. Big mistake!! I normally wear an 8. So I had to return it for a 9 and that worked just fine. Really happy with them.
198089,1,"can't ever go wrong with a pair of chucks! they always say go a half a size down, but in my boyfriends case he had to go a full size down, and me i'm safe with going half a size down..so it definitly varys"
266666,1,I've always loved the Hi-Tec Altitude boots. This will be my third pair of them. They were only replaced due to the wear and tear on them through the years I've had them.
33532,1,I got 4 letters 4 you P-I-M-P
87367,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
91575,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
103239,1,The ballet shoes are beautiful however they are not true to size they run small. I unfortunatley threw out the receipt and my daughter ripped the box they hard to get on her feet so I will definetely have to order a bigger size but I would defintely recommend.
156577,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
115214,1,"First of all I suggest 1/2 number less... if you compare it with adidas sneakers. The shoes are great, made with good materials, good design and very comfortable. I ordered these sneakers on black, but came gray on logo and the rear part, but there's no regret about it, looks so good. Definitely I recommend this item."
337519,1,"buy this one for my girl friend, she like it, feel comfortable whe she wear it. Seem nice as well, maybe i need one for myself."
242089,1,"Bought these for him and he enjoyed them. Very flexible and easy on your feet. I own a pair of these myself, and although the sole can get scuffed very easily, it's still a great shoe in regards to running or when you need black shoes for your outfit. Runs a half size bigger than usual so know your size before you order onlinel"
245634,0,"The shoe pictured is what I was expecting, but the shoe received has a shorter, flatter heel; I'll keep it, but really prefer the 1-1/4&#34; heel depicted.."
296880,1,"I ordered the beeswax colored shoe and the true color is more like the rear of the shoe in the online picture, the fade effect in the front isn't really there. I love the shoes and I can't stop getting compliments about them. They are very comfortable and run about a half size larger. Would definitely purchase again."
305189,0,"I bought these for my 2 year old little boy. The boots look great and are well made but they are REALLY difficult to get on,even with the laces completely removed. After about a dozen wearings they break in and start to go on easier, but if you are buying these for a baby or toddler, be prepared to spend an extra ten minutes putting these on your little guy for the first few weeks!"
198474,1,she loves her boots..came in excellant conditions and on time..cheaper than buying them in a store..will purchase more in the near future
381535,0,I purchased these to supplement some others I had my students wearing. I have had to repair the buckles every time hey have been worn.
103979,1,"These tennis shoes are the best! No more ""tennis toes."" Comfortable, with roomy toe box...and vented to let the air in. (Buy one-half size larger than you usually take.) I hope K-Swiss will continue to make them."
30454,1,"These are the most comfortable flip-flops I've ever had. They are so soft, yet sturdy. I have many pairs in lots of colors and wear them every chance I get. I think they're different because they're made of rubber instead of foam. More expensive than the cheap ones at Target that cost $2, but worth the $15 or so for these. They are so comfortable! You will love them."
367254,1,"Read a review on Surfline about this product and decided it was what I needed to dry my booties fast and get rid of that horrible smell. First of all I got this product really quickly, a few days earlier than expected. When you get it, just take it out of the box and it is ready to use, nothing complicated about using it. Has a timed venting system that uses room temp air or heated air. The heated air is not so hot that it would damage your booties, but I have only used the heat for the first hour and a half of drying then switch to no heat and the booties dry within a few hours. My booties are dry for my next morning session and the best part is that with every use that terrible smell is going away. This device is small and does not take up a lot of room. I love it and it is worth every penny to keep my booties dry and smell free."
368548,1,"My son loves this shoe. I've bought him several pairs. When he outgrew one pair of these, he wanted them again for his next pair of shoes. I printed out the size guide from the Stride-Rite website. The fit was great. Ordering these online made the whole shoe buying experience much faster and more pleasant than making the trek to a physical shoe store."
291961,1,"I love this shoe. It's dressy, but casual enough for every day summer wear, and it's comfortable for walking around every day. I bought one years ago at a retail store, then when they started breaking down I tried to find another shoe that fit the casual-dressy-comfortable category and couldn't find anything else that came close. I found these here, and ordered the same ones I had before, and am very happy about it. Just wish they had the other colors in stock for size 6!"
158044,1,These shoes are great! I had a pair already and wanted a spare...could not find them locally but found them on Amazon.Amazon has almost everything I want and provides great service as well!
228284,1,"I had to buy several Converse All-Star shoes for my newly formed basketball league. The wife recommended buying them at the German retail giant Kohl's. She wanted to use the 30% off coupon. But for some reason them Germans don't want to carry the in-between shoe sizes for those rare instances of humans that fit somewhere in the middle of 10 and 11.Thanks to the a seller on the Amazon Marketplace, I was able to get a pair at a comparable price that was shipped merely a day later after ordering! Yay to my new league getting to finally play their first game!"
195688,1,"Middle-aged, Fat Guy Running With Stress Fractures, Calcium Deposits, Shin Splints & Bone Spurs (Not a pretty sight): these shoes."
285545,1,"I have a pair of these shoes in brown that I bought some time ago. I love them, although they are getting older now and starting to show smudges and wear. They are still comfortable, but don't look as good as they did. I feel I got my money out of them and am not disappointed at all on their life. They looked great with jeans or dress pants, and are comfortable and well built, although sometimes my friends would tease and call them my ""manly shoes"". The only reason I haven't replaced this particular shoe yet is because I have gotten spoiled with the other Eastland shoes that are slip-ons, where these require lacing. Not to sound lazy, but it is much easier when your hands are full to slip the shoes on or off at the door, rather than lacing in or out. If an oxford is what you are looking for, I would recommend this one without reservation. They are comfortable, solid, and I didn't slip and slide in them in bad weather either."
185020,0,"The black version of the Itasca SeaRay Slides arrived on time and in a box. They fit and are moderately comfortable. For the $30 or so shipped, they are about what i would expect. But, these are not some deeply discounted irregulars or end of line, though they may actually be. The are worth the $24.99. The smell of rubber was dominant when i opened up the box. there is no more than a flat piece of thin material separating the rubber from the removable insert. They are light and do fit comfortably but do not , by any means compare to the other higher line mocs that happen to go on some drastic sale and if i am lucky enough to find my size at the same time they go on sale-once every 3years. maybe. So, these seemed to be ok out of the box. i am wearing them and went for a walk without them breaking down and without getting any blisters. They do have a nice back for the achilles tendon and some foam in it with a center portion cut down for easier entry and removal, not much support but a nicer addition. there are elastic gores on each side with very little stretch to them but fine. my size was on target.the only real issue was that these were no way first quality or regular. there are glue spots all over the toe and fronts of both shoes. not little ones but sizable and 4 on one shoe and a couple on the other. they do not come off. At first , i thought it was only dust from shipping or a shelf storage. only it didnt come off with a light brushing nor with some water on a cloth. For me, it isnt a big deal because i always spill something i am cooking on my new shoes the first time i wear them anyway. I cant help it, always have, I used to cook for a living and now for amusement so am used to having a couple of oil spots on everything. Some people might be put off by the glue drips. I dont really mind but would normally want to be the one who gets the first spots or stains on my shoes (or shirts) thinking that this time I will keep them in perfect shape for more than a day.For the price i paid ,no problem, had i paid the 'full price' listed on the screen of $60, i would have returned them today-the day i got them."
59259,1,almost like my last pair that lasted 7 years just a little taller. Rugged holds up well to everyday wear almost the only thing I wear year round.
11921,1,"I got these shoes for my boyfriend, and there was absolutely NO other place that had these in his size!! I ordered them, and they came in WAY earlier than I expected! Even earlier than the shipping expectancy! Ill buy Chucks from here for now on!"
232485,1,These excellent leather Dockers met my expectations completely and is determined by the size and quality and on a discount price! Recommend as a pleasant shopping!
138324,1,This is the 10th pair of Supernova Cushions I have purchased and I love them. They have a very thick cushion and it has cured my shin splints.

78122,1,"This great outdoor shoes, has a very price-quality relation. Are you loocking for a outdoor shoes ???. Look at that. Confortable and good price."
363321,1,"This shoes came in and i feel in love with them, they are in great condition. Just what i wanted and expected! the color is great. They came in the box and they looked stunning. I totally recommend them!"
50270,0,"These shoes are perfect for getting ahead in the ongoing struggle for survival in your modern law offices. Not only do the soles provide ideal traction for rapid charges and retreats on low-pile striped-pattern earthtone carpets, but the neutral flesh color enables you to blend undetectably into the background scenery of a high-pressure strategy meeting. Buy two, they're cheap at the price."

129302,1,"This is my fourth pair of Ariat Men's Terrains...you just can't beat them for good looks, wonderful comfort, excellent support, and they last and last! I wear them every day...keep the newest pair for going shopping, etc. Been wearing Ariat Terrain's for years and years - they are the best of the best! The price and delivery from Amazon was absolutely the best buy anywhere! This is THE place to shop!"
3080,1,"Excellent hiking or everyday boot.Extremely good value and fit.Hardly any ""breakin"" required.I would definitely recommend these for anyone interested in a hard wearing boot,for the money."
5454,2,The sandal is stiff and the quality is so so. The original price is marked much way too high compared to the quality.
313965,1,Boots arrived within the window given. They fit perfectly and are much nicer than I thought they'd be quality-wise. Wore them all day the first time and had none of the soreness from breaking in new boots. They're waterproof as advertised and great. Wish the seller had a way to track shipping but the boots arrived within the time they said they would so there's no problem.
168492,1,Got here on time to be given as a Christmas gift and she loves them.
257067,0,"Somehow I don't feel comfortable when there are two belts or shoelaces not linked anywhere. Their width is not equal. So if I sew them on the shoes, that won't look nice. The shoes may not need a lace to tie tight. But to secure, the laces may still be needed. So I will return the shoes."
175691,1,These shoes look just like the picture. I will be able to wear them with almost any color. They are very comfortable initially. (I can't comment further on comfort as I haven't worn them for any length of time.) I only wish they made other colors in my size! I can't beleive they got here so fast!
63385,0,"This type of sneaker is not a durable quality sneaker at all. I have purchased at tag sales old Ked's sneakers for $3-$5 dollars which were much more durable. I save this pair purchased for going out on business trips or the like since this type of Ked's sneakers wouldn't last a week with my daily work chores, sad to say."
302772,1,These have been my favorite sandals for 5 years. I always end up buying them because they are true to size and Clarks makes a good shoe. They look great with casual clothing. You won't be disappointed.
106075,1,This are wonderful well made and resistant work shoes. I order this for a friend of mine in honduras and she is very happy with them.
67634,2,"I appreciate the attention to detail this brand has, but in my opinion, they look better in the picture."
317640,1,"Make you run faster, jump higher, stand straighter.This is my fourth pair of flyers (third red!). I wear them till they wear out, which is usually at least 2 years."
324293,1,If you were ever looking for luxury and comfort in a clog this is the ultimate. I found these clogs an irresistible purchase. At Zappos they were double the price. I found them at half the price at my favorite bookmark Amazon.
8423,1,"I have been wearing KEDs for over 50 years, love them. They were exactly what I odered, no problems"
359488,1,"Good fit, especially after I added a Dr. Scholl's arch support. Comfortable and easy to clean. Wore out my last pair."
219535,1,"These are very comfortable shoes that I've been looking for. An excellent item, a reasonable price, and a fast delivery this company offers should fulfill customer's satisfaction."
81417,1,"As the title says, I believe this is an essential purchase for any man. They're comfortable, light, and good looking. The flat sole is great for extended walking and sports (specially weight lifting in my case). I like how they look and make my feet look slim as well. Heheh. Combined with my other clothing, I like how they help make everything seem that much ""tighter"". These are just a must have :)"
362950,1,"I love these shoes for my little girl. We have had them in a size 4, 5 and now a 6. They seem comfortable to her and are really easy to put on - without tacky Velcro(R) straps. Plus, they are just like real adult shoes. People always say, ""those shoes are so cute. They look just like Merrells."" I say, that is becasue they are! They are always suprised to know Merrell makes little kids shoes."
88318,1,"This was a gift for my sister, and as far as I can tell, she loves them. I might get a pair for myself!"
78802,1,"They are chucks! You cant go wrong! Best shoe out there for the price, you give up a litle comfortability but they do what they are meant to do!"
180929,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
276136,0,"only worn twice but seems decent quality for price, tongue is set low so wont be waterproof past halfway point and size seems pretty accuratehard bare inside so should use an insert"
75935,1,This shoe is like walking on pillows. They can be worn with just about everthing. I have had 4 pair over the years.
251009,1,"I have had these boots for about 4 months now and have been real rough on them from the start. they were a little uncomfortable while breaking them in but now they fit like a glove. I have green superfeet insoles for more arch support and couldn't ask for more. The leather is pretty scratched up on the outside but they clean up nice. I walked all through germany and italy in them and while my feet hurt like hell, it wasn't due to the boots (too much walking and standing for someone like me). I work in a mechanics shop and its taken the continual fluid spills and corrosive chemicals that I encounter every day. My girlfriend accidentally ran over them today and aside from a broken pull tab on one side they were ok. these boots have surpassed the two other pairs of doc martens I own and I expect another year or so out of them. I definitely recommend these boots to anyone looking at them.."
86257,1,Just ordered earlier today but had the same pair for years and loved them! Cannot wait to update everyone re how much I love this pair as well.
37647,1,"Comfortable. Hope they last. Last ones I bought came apart at the seams in a year. Love the shoe, though, and so does my wife."
248832,1,This is a great boot and my son loved it. We live in Hawaii and went home for Thanksgiving to Idaho. Since my son had never worn boots like this we were concerned he wouldn't do well with them. But he really loved them and they survived two weeks in the rain and snow of Washington and Idaho. And they looked great on him! I definitely recommend them.
153941,1,"love them can wear with out socks, great for wearing with jeans love them as much as I love my emu's"
254544,1,Adorable!! I have always loved Kswiss tennis shoes! They fit well and are easy to clean. I received them very quickly. A no hassle purchase.
34969,1,This isn't my first pair of Danskos so I knew I was getting a comfy pair of shoes for my work in the operating room. Just about every person I work with has a pair and they are truly great for walking and being on your feet.
174430,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
90818,1,"problems with high arch? This shoe is designed for support and stability. Almost high enough for my very high arch. Great heal support counters tendancy to pronate in or out. Several tighter heal lacing mechanism. Flex plastic waffle support sandwiched between multiple density foam for good cushion and great stability. Just enough front flex to run well without too much flex to painful high arch. Amamzingly long lasting soft, high carbon rubber on 50% sole and rest covered in very grippy yet lasting foam. I thought I'd burn right thru the 3mm+tread carbon but 1000mi later it 2mm tread is blown thru on highest wear portionsOn thrid pair. Each time suprised how long it been when it's time to buy a new pair because the body has started to break down."
273842,0,These boots last 5-6 years.I used them mostly for winter atving. I also studded the tred with hex head screws for traction on ice.
293255,1,"These shoes are not only fashionable, but the 2 inch sole provides cushioning for the joints. I've had my first pair for about 5 years and they're still going strong. I was on a tennis shoe kick amd wore tennis shoes for about three months and noticed that my knee joints started bothering me. One day I threw my creepers on and I noticed the difference in my joints almost immediately. I ordered 3 pairs and I love them. The key with this product is sizing. Because the style is unisex, you really need to verify whether the product was manufactured in womens or mens sizes. I wear a womens US 9.5, so I ordered a womens 10 in creeper shoes manufactured in womens sizes and a mens 8 in creeper shoes manufactured in mens sizes. I ordered a size 10 in this specific product and they fit perfectly.p.s. I ordered from Exotic High Heels and I found they have the best selection and they were a pleasure to deal with."
177790,1,"love the boots. very comfortable and solid. seller was very accomadating when order was lost by shipper. overall, very pleased with purchase."
380529,1,"I needed shoes for a burlesque dance class. Many people recommended capezio. These shoes are lightweight, comfortable and true to size. Highly recommended"
205855,1,Wife loves this product. She is disappointed that it is appearently unavailable in the Yellow color anymore.
17797,1,I was soooo tickled pink with my pink Nellie Chukka boots. I saw them on the web page and I had to have them. Pink is my favorite color. They are extremely well made. They didn't need breaking in either. That is a major plus. They fit perfectly. Also they arrived in record time except it was like waiting for Christmas. I love them so much it is all I can do not to wear them to bed. :-) I want several more pairs. I am waiting for them to be available in red leather.
80749,1,"I ordered these for my granddaughter's birthday. They were shippped promptly, and I was able to track them very efficiently. They were exactly what we wanted!!! They are very attractive and wear well."
68489,1,"I received my purchase in good time. After opening the package, I noticed one of the two pairs of shoes I bought was in tact - brand new in the box. The second pair appaired to be used as a store sample pair, but was not about to wrap them up and return them. I simply decided to wear them first. The shoes are fantastic! Once on my feet, I feel ""light"" and dressed for success. The shoes make you ""feel"" good and they look great. Overall, I am more than happy. The price was better than any place else could give, and this was after extensive research. You just cannot go wrong with these shoes."
207762,1,"These boots are just as they appear in the photograph: fun, cute, and protective...I mucked through the mud at my farm and no wet feet.The only issue I had with them was that my feet pressed against the top of the boot...to the point of loosing feeling! I took the insoles out and PROBLEM SOLVED! Maybe less comfortable but a thinner insole could be bought and inserted.Bottom Line: Definitely worth the adjustment for these cute boots"
37649,1,AFTER A LITTLE BREAKING IN I AM COMPETLY SATIFIED...MY LAST PAIR OF SKETCHERS LASTED 3 YRS
76343,2,"I was really excited to receive this pair of gorgeous sandals, but upon a few hours of wearing them, the links broke! Needless to say, I had to return them - very reluctantly."
188400,1,"I bought these socks for my husband for Christmas and they were a perfect fit! Comfortable and warm! However, he noticed a small tear near the heel of the sock when he put them on. I called Amazing Socks and told them about the problem. The lady apologized for the problem and told me to discard or donate the pair I had and that they would send me a replacement pair immediately! Wow, great service!Especially for the day after Christmas! I will shop amazing socks again for sure! Love fleece socks in the winter!"
380937,1,these are great and fit true to size...not too high for dancing...color is close to skin and blends nicely with my leg
170831,1,"I have had shoes that force your foot to conform to its shape, but Crocs conform to your foot! I love my Crocs, they are so comfortable and light, it feels like you are walking on a marshmallow. You can wear them in the shower, driving, in line at the post office or wherever. They come in tons of colors if you look around. My 9 year old son starting wearing these last April, it is November and colder but he still will not wear anything else. He swears that nothing else feels so good. I am buying him another pair due to his growth but the others look like new, they have held up well. They never smell like his tennis, as they are anti-microbial. They mold to your foot as you wear them, and it's your own body heat that does it. The interior actually molds itself to your foot as your body temperature warms and softens the material. They have a nice wide toe box, and a orthotic footbed with good arch support, and it cups your heel nicely. It has little tiny raised bumps on the sole that massage your feet and keep air circulating so you don't get sweaty.They float if you drop them overboard, unlike the rubber clogs from other companies. They are very light, so light they feel like air and you may mistake them for being flimsy but they are tough. When they are dirty you can hose them off, wipe them with a rag and they look new again. They do not tear or scrape, and they leave no marks on the floor, and they give you traction on a wet floor. They have a strap that you can tilt forward like a clog, or slip behind your heel for a more secure fit. There are knock off brands that copy the look but not the feel as the others are heavy rubber, and not comfortable at all. With crocs you can stand on them all day, and they breathe unlike rubber. The nurses really were the first folks to flock to these, since they are on their feet all day they really watch out for comfort first. But these are great at the pool, the beach, wherever, and they are so cheap and come in so many colors you can afford to have a few. Also try Keens Newport H2 sandals."
293354,1,"I had a pair of these years ago when I was climbing more regularly, and used them for years. They have great edging power, and the fit is very tight in all the right places without being such a squeeze that I can't keep them on for longer multi-pitch work. Some people have had problems with quick delaminating--I haven't experienced anything of the sort, but will keep an eye out for it on this pair."
185176,1,estoy feliz con la compra pues no conseguia numero grande en chile para mi esposo. ademas la entrega fue rapida
222012,1,"I'm a flip-flop and sandal lover. When I need to wear real shoes and socks, I grab these. They are comfy."
176066,1,"I bought these boots a year or two ago. I was already buying cheap Payless boots, but they didn't last very long, and I wanted some boots that were a little more stylish. While these are very stylish and much cheaper than Timberlands (about half as much to be exact), I've found they have almost no arch support. It was actually a little painful for me to wear them until I bought some cheap arch support inserts. I'm not quite sure I'd buy a pair of these again, but considering I've had them for a while and they've hardly worn at all, I guess I won't really have to."
50123,1,Shoes are true to size. Will be getting them in black too! Shoes are comfortable and look / feel well made.
203039,0,"These weighed a ton. They fit all right and everything, high quality and the color I like, but I had to ship them back, they were just too big and heavy. I opted for a low cut athletic style safety shoe with an alloy toe that weighs 1/3 less than steel toes."
266364,1,"I live in northern Minnesota and these are great for winter. Warm, waterproof and good grip on the icy sidewalks. Very comfortable too. I have a very nice pair of Sorel winter boots but they are HEAVY for day to day activities. During the winter I wear the Sorels to work and then keep a pair of tennis shoes in my office to change into once I get there. No need for that any more. Driving is nicer too. Have you ever tried to drive a vehicle with giant winter boots on? Not fun."
321340,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
315489,1,"I have an excessivly wide foot. This purchase ended a long search for a boot that felt as I thought it should feel, with no pinched feet. The boot is soft supple leather but not too soft as to lose it's shape. Being an older person I looked for a lighter weight boot this one fits the bill, speaking of which, was at a very good price. I would give this boot a 4 1/2 star rating"
150099,1,"I have to tell anyone, who has lower back or foot pain, to try a pair of Merrells. When you try them on, they feel comfortable, but once you wear them for a week, you'll never wear another brand of footwear (unless you have to). Most of their shoes need no ""break in"" time. I own these in four different colors. My eldest daughter owns two pairs of these. I own more than 20 pairs of Merrells, I have been wearing these for years. The cool thing about them is, when you see someone else wearing a pair, it's like you're both in on a secret. You know, you're walking in heaven."
381129,1,easy spirit is a natural choice for all casual comfort. this shoe rivals more expensive walking shoes with cushioned comfort and flexibility.
167997,0,i bought these before seeing danner's comment on their web site that these boots are better for a narrow foot.i never thought i had a wide foot before but i purchased these in my normal size and they were tight on the edges and long in the toe.instead of re-ordering in a wide size i returned them and got one of danner's other lasts for a more typical sized foot.
36669,1,"I ordered a pair of these boots last week, When they came I was disappointed in the quality of one boot's leather, which was very thin, more like glove leather than boot leather. I am reticent to return items and for fifty years I never did. However, something priced over $200 seems a good candidate for a return if it doesn't meet expectations.I shipped the floppy-leather pair back to Amazon myself. I might say please take advantage of their UPS pickup option as the price to ship them yourself is way above the reimbursement you will receive. The return was received yesterday and the new boots arrived today.One thing I immediately noted about the new pair versus the old is that the new came wrapped in tissue paper, with several inspectors tags in the box and with a product tag zip-tied to the boot. The other pair had none of these, which confirmed my suspicion that I'd received someone else's return the first time.The quality of these new boots is much better than those of the previous pair, more like the Danners that I've worn since the I was discharged from the army in 1980. They still don't seem quite as heavy as the old-timey Danners but this is to be expected because the company is making boots advertised to have no break-in period. Right out of the box, they are soft and comfortable and my 10-year-old Danners are quite jealous of their bright new look."
337593,1,"the only problem i had with this shoe was the sizing, i usually wears 8 or 8.5 but the size i bought was 5.5 so it was a little bit unusual!!!"
334483,1,"These boots are amazing. I got them because I am 4'11'' and I needed good boots to ride my motorscooter. I have only had them for a little bit, but I think they'll last as long as you don't treat them like hiking boots. I'm glad I didn't get them from here though, they were on sale at Macy's (in San Francisco). Hope this was useful."
263386,1,"Buenos tiempos de entrega y el producto lleg&oacute; en buenas condiciones, Pueden comprar en esta tienda cuando quieran, 100% recomendable"
260183,1,"Normal chucks...awesome as always. I've worn them for the past 2 years. They're looking a little worn now, time to buy another pair. :)"
130519,1,"Honestly, I've been wearing these shoes since I was 16. I'm now 23 and refuse to wear anything else. I tend to go through a pair a year (Ohio winters are harsh on shoes) and have 5-6 pairs in my closet just in case Eastland decides to stop making this style.The absolute most comfortable, most durable shoe I've ever come across. If told to choose between these shoes and my mother....I'd have a REALLY hard time picking."
106442,1,"I really like this shoe! It's hard for me to find a shoe as narrow as I need, but this one fits just right across the toes and on the heel. It's a little wide at the instep, but I can definitely live with it. I was a little dissappointed to find there is no arch support. I think if there were a support, the wideness would disappear."
71749,1,"THESE FROG BOOTS ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WORN WITH SOCKS. VERY CUTE AND PRACTICAL FOR WORKING IN THE GARDEN. THEY KEEP YOUR FEET WARM, CLEAN AND DRY. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES TO GET DOWN AND DIRTY IN THE GARDEN!"
244561,1,Couldn't find these shoes locally so I found them at Amazon at $15 less per pair than was shown in Penney's catalog. This made me very happy. They shipped promptly also.
280301,1,"I love these sneakers, I wear them all the time. I now have them in two colors. I bought them for $40 in a boutique in Venice CA for $40 and found them on Amazon for HALF! Amazing. SHOP AMAZON"
158992,1,"I originally bought these to finish off my Tenth Doctor costume, but they're actually really nice shoes. I wear them often and they are quite comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the colored band on the sole has started to come up on one of them... It isn't glued to the shoe very well. But for what I paid for them, I'm willing to let that slide."
121299,1,"I am going on my 4th pair of Samba Milleniums and I can't wait to get my new ones which should be arriving any time now. I have 3 pair of the original black/white samba milleniums. All three pairs are still in good condition and have a lot of wear left in them. I used to get a new pair of tennis shoes about every 6 months because I wear them every day. However, since obtaining my first pair of samba milleniums, that ratio has become 1 pair of tennis shoes a year and for the past 3 years, it has been the same shoe. I am waiting on a rare limited edition pair of samba milleniums that are red with white stripes and have the liverpool crest on them. Those shoes were made for a short time in 2006 and I have spent the past 2-3 months trying to find a new pair in my size which I just did a couple of days ago. I would recommend these shoes to anyone and everyone."
190679,1,Not many shoe companies bother to make different widths. That's amazing considering that millions live in this country alone and they can't all have the same feet width. The extra width means I no longer get corns and blisters. Plus the show is very good. I'm stuck on New Balance.
298012,1,these are the same shoes my dad wore when he is still hip back in the 70s. this is the best price i have ever seen @80 bucks. big smile =D
92741,1,"Since I wear a brace on one foot - I need to stretch one shoe. This gadget works so well, I've gotten a few of them."
334995,1,I would rate that shoes more than 5 stars.It is extra light.Very comfortable for walking.Excellent value for the money.I have paid 250$ for New Balance Men's MR2002 Training Shoe & it is less comfortable than 50$ shoes!!
77527,1,I was hoping to get a size &quot;13&quot; of the Fubu Men's 6&quot; ThugBlack but could not find my size. Please is there any way of getting size 13 of this shoe?Thanks
376027,1,"I love the shoes, I am a diabetic who has a job that requires a lot of standing and walking. The other reviewrs comments are true and I have to say I was quite surprise with the card that came with the shoes, a warranty! Anyway they are comfortable even though it looks kind of stiff. Love the style and colors. Going to buy another pair but black. Looking for shoe would highly recommend this product."
320723,1,"I've been doing ballet-style workout DVDs at home lately, and wanted a pair of ballet shoes to use for those workouts so that I'd have better grip and support. I can't speak to how well these work for ballet classes, but I thought that my review might help others like me who are buying these for the same reason.Based on some reviews, I ended up ordering these at first one size larger than what I usually wear in my street shoes. The 8.5 that I bought (instead of my usual 7.5) were huge, but (thanks, Amazon, for your great return policy), I returned these and ordered a 7.5, which fit perfectly.The ribbon at the front of the shoe can be pulled tight to adjust the width of them, and they are very comfortable. They don't have a split sole on the bottom; instead, the sole is one long piece that stretches down the length of the shoe.If you're looking for some at-home ballet-style workouts, I also recommend Mary Helen Bowers'Ballet Beautiful: Total Body WorkoutandBallet Beautiful: Body Blastand Leah Sarago's four workouts, especially her newest oneBallet Body Signature Series: Total Body. All of these are a lot of fun to do, and make me feel like a ballerina!"
237645,1,"Excellent ballet shoes. Just remember to buy a size bigger, 'cause they run a bit small. I'm usually a 7 o 7.5, and I had to get an 8."
386921,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
380867,1,"These are great boots for a great price. Very comfortable, good looking and tough. I will recommend these boots for all purpose...thanks guys!"
79079,2,"These shoes look great. They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays. The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet. The soles are too flat. When I tried running in them, my heels began to hurt. Walking wise, they aren't the most comfortable to say the least. They are also heavy for what they are. Too expensive for what they are. These shoes are probably bad for your back because they don't absorb any impact. Personally, I don't recommend them for anyone."
235400,2,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED SHOES FROM AMAZON (SHOEFLAKE) AND THEY WERE ENTIRELY THE WRONG SHOE. FORTUNATELY, I HAD SOMEONE TO GIVE THEM TO. HOWEVER, I AM OUT $60+ DOLLARS."
71416,1,"I walk 30 minutes each day and, whenever possible, buy Ryka brand walking shoes each time I buy new ones. They fit the best of all the brands I have tried since they are made specifically for a woman's foot. I do not get the slippage in the heel like I do with other brands. These are comfortable right out of the box and have a great cushioned feel. This is my second pair of this style. I bought the first last year in a mall store in a size 10, my usual size. They fit fine but, to me, feel a bit shorter than usual. I bought this pair from Amazon in a 10 1/2 (the mall store does not carry 10 1/2 but jump right to an 11). This gives me that tad more room in the length that I wanted. I feel it is probably best to go up 1/2 size in this style. Thanks to Amazon for carrying this half size."
240255,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
338047,1,"a great shoe, buy a size below what you usually wear. comfy, durable and a great casual look with jeans."
385512,1,"These things are awesome. Great fit and finish, friends think I'm wearing loafers when I wear jeans because they look that good."
18505,1,"Great support, look and price....will only buy HAVAIANAS from now on, amazing. Going to order them in every color..even great around the house."
211146,1,Super comfortable.I have truly enjoyed my pair and plan to order more in a variety of colors.I can wear these all day without any foot issues. Very durable shoe.
262991,1,That's a product with a long tradition in market and I just was replacing my old sneakers. Coverse really rules.
53836,1,Purchased these for my 75 year old sister who had been looking and looking for some navy keds. She loves them.
21206,2,"Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking, exercise, etc. I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D, unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough. Liked the look but it's not for me."
260090,1,"I have large (13 EE) feet and SIDI Dominator Megas are the only quality shoe I can wear comfortably.The lorica material wears like a dream. It breaks in like leather, cleans up with a stiff brush or occasionally, saddle soap, and never curls or changes its shape with moisture. The insoles on the older model (Dominator 4) were chintzy, but have gotten better, although nothing beats Specialized's cycling insoles (also pricey). I've worn Dominators on rides with 10 miles of hike-a-bike and they felt great. The compression strap closures can't be beat and can be replaced separately. Several of my friends also rock SIDIs. Not one complaint. A great Italian shoe."
162042,1,"Hi,Can anyone tell me how to buy the item? I can only select the size or the color, but never both, so I cannot buy the item. And I don't know how to contact the seller. Thank you!"
65958,1,"+quick delivery, good product,-had to pay extra customs, would be nice if rates are mentionned...didn't know that..."
302910,1,"This is simply the best dress shoe I have ever worn. I have been buying these shoes since 1998. This is my ninth pair in 14 years. I walk a lot and the soft sole is far better than leather or hard rubber, doesn't slip on wet surfaces, and is incredibly durable. I keep the older pairs and wear them as casual everyday shoes instead of sneakers."
145244,1,"the color and texture is more than I expected, too bad the weather was cold enough for me to rock them the way they were intended to be"
89608,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
194504,1,"have been wearing this style of sandle for years, don't know what i would do without them. and i am a shoe person!"
328610,0,"I was looking for a decent pair of running shoes as I had taken up running nearly every morning for close to an hour. I knew I couldn't skimp on price for a decent shoe that would relieve pressure from my knees and provide comfort. I also do NOT go to a gym to run on a treadmill and purchased these for outdoor running purposes.The obvious large support you see at the bottom of the shoe is what sold me on these. However, they are not as supportive as they look. To me, they were a bit uncomfortable to wear and felt a little ""heavy"" on my feet while running. Again, I run outdoors so the downside of the support visibly seen underneath the shoe means a lot of cleaning as anything & everything will get inside this area if you're an outdoor runner. After runs, I've tracked mud, dirt, sand, grass - whatever my feet happened to cross that day, right back to my house. Everything pretty much becomes embedded into the bottom of the shoe and it's very hard to remove & clean, even when you attempt to do it immediately.These shoes are okay, and probably better for an indoor runner. At the same time, I've bought running shoes that were WAY more comfortable and supportive and DID help with relieving knee pressure that were MUCH cheaper than these. I certainly don't think they are worth the price and would not buy another pair based on that alone. For the amount they cost, I'd expect COMPLETE comfort, durability & support (or at least close to it).I was disappointed with this shoe as it simply just didn't provide enough of what I had expected for the price. I received MUCH more from running shoes that didn't cost nearly as much as these, so that's another reason I find this shoe to be just terribly overpriced and not worth the money."
210278,0,"After reading all these reviews... major are talking very good about product. But... First of all: size- very huge, mine is 7,5(B) for open toes shoes and 8 for all the other... so, this shoes I've ordered 7,5 and they are really huge, I can enter my finger between my heel and shoe heel counter area.... which is very bad considering Nine West size chart.Second: The color is not the same as on a picture, I choosed taupe and if You choose this option You will see beautiful taupe-beige tone... So, in a real is not, it's more faded greyish taupe tone, like it was used before (My opinion only)...The quality looks good, comfortability - i'm not sure because the heel counter area is very hard and due to wrong size I can't say how is.All over, I can't send them back, because I'm in Dominican Republic, so the price to send'em back is very high, it will cost me a fortune of money, so I'll keep them as a Money spent monument...Be warned anyone who buy any item and can't change later..."
259360,1,"I bought the shoes for my little sister as a gift. She was delighted. She says the shoes are very confortable and can wear different styles. Nice confection and they were sent ontime. From my side, no complains."
68568,0,"This is a great baby shoe but if you little one is walking already don't buy it because they don't have any rubber to prevent falls!! If is for babies ok, toddlers no!"
15574,1,I bought these boots for my husband for Christmas. He says they are the best waterproof boots he has ever owned. Very comfortable.
44172,1,"I use this shoe for training and for racing, for long runs and for interval workouts. My weekly mileage is in the 30-38 mile range, and the Green Silence is a nice, light ride. I believe the weight is advertised as 8.3 ounces, and without getting out my wife's food scale, I'd say that's a pretty accurate estimate. My sense is that there's a limit to the number of miles I'd take this shoe. The cushioning is limited, but the overall feel is pleasantly surprising. Short distances feel really smooth; longer distances slightly less so, compared to traditional trainers. The payoff, though, is the lightweight feel and speed--the exact qualities I want in a shoe when I'm looking to do faster training."
235047,1,I have had several pairs of this shoe. Looks good and feels great plus I wear a 101/2 which is hard to find. Ido not know why manufacturers of shoes think that after 10 they only make whole sizes. Will probably buy other colors of this shoe.
153813,1,Thank you for being prompt in service as well as delivering a great product that is well worth the money.
313386,1,"The product was brand new, everything was like described, they are really looking good and are warm as well, the perfect winter shoe"
123698,1,"These are some very nice shoes. I love the blue and black ones. These really should get some more publicity because the are better than all other basketball shoes. They are also very comfortable. If you want to get some high quality shoes for a good price, get T-Macs!!!!!!!!!!!"
344050,1,"............ Purchase these boots, super comfortable and exceptionally warm! If you cannot stand warm feet, don't buy this.Otherwise, if you want warm feet, do purchase these!Solid Timberland product!"
226738,1,I ordered these shoes for my son who is a Crossfit Trainer. He wears a size 13 shoe so this is what I ordered. When the shoes arrived they were at least 2 sizes too large. My son said that they measured at least a size 14/15. I had to return them. So if you are ordered these remember that they run very large.
124603,1,These little pumps are exactly what I expected to receive. They look simple and neat. I had to stretch the right one a bit as my right foot is wider than my left. I would definitely recommend them.
60494,0,"Very comfortable boots. Actually make you want to walk. But forget about being waterproof. Its very temporary. This was my fourth pair. They all have leaked, and soon after wearing. If they could solve this problem, I would buy again."
136511,1,Good and quick. Love the shoes although it was a bit confusing whether it was hi top or not as it showed up differently on my order form. But it was hi-tops and I'm happy :-)
334366,1,"Being a marketing major in college....I personally support Kenneth Cole for his genius idea of creating his company as a ""Film Production""....I love the style of the shoes, they fit well, and I can wear them at work and then out to the club at night.....however the seam where the leather meets the sole....has begun to come apart... but I wouldn't be necessarily quick to judge that it's the shoes fault...because I have had numerous shoes do this....due to my habit of standing on the sides of my feet...."
205251,1,"Just started wearing them, but if they last as long as my last Danner boots, I will be very happy. I had the last pair 5 years, and in my line of work the environment is horrible on boots. Masonry products dry out and destroy every boot I ever owned in several months to a year max. I did nothing to take care of the last pair and they were the made in the USA ones also. These ones fit perfect, 4 full days of just wearing them around town and they are breaking in. My advice is when you spend $140-200 on a pair of supposedly good, Asian made boots and get several months to a year out of them you are wasting money. If you wear your boots for work and motorcycle riding or other activities everyday and get 4 years out of them, that is around $85 per year, if you use good boot dressing and clean the mortar and concrete off and get 5 or 6 years out of them you are way ahead of the game. Bottom line awesome boot and you only get what you pay for. If you only used this boot for recreation purposes and not for everyday destructive work, you may get 10 or even 15 years out of them if taken care of."
329172,1,"I have worn several issue boots that ranged from really good (Matterhorn ICB's) to terrible (Vietnam Era Jungle Boots were still issued in 1999 when I enlisted). USMC issues Danners now, and I have always heard great things about Danner boots. I'm in a rare spot in the military that still wears black boots and these fit the required specs nicely. The comfort is unmatched by anything I have owned to date.For comfort, they required zero break-in period. My only complaint is that the leather is squeaky. Flexing & extending my toe makes a lot of noise (it's not the sole) but this will probably (hopefully) break in. I have never had all-leather boots before, so maybe that is leather's M.O.Unfortunately I am resigned to a desk for the time being so I can't speak to how they do in the elements. They are damm sexy though.The price is good compared to Danner's website and a big thanks to all stores (including this one) on amazon that ship to FPO/APO. It's just like shipping to New York, so spread the word to all the vendors."
231965,1,"This is my second pair. When i first bought my first pair of this shoes i was amaze of how confortable they are. It was incredible the softness inside and how flexible they are. It makes you feel that you are not using any shoes at all.I spend a period of two year with the first pair, and i changed for a second pair similar to the first.You can use it in casual ocassions with some jean pants and Khakis. Also they look very cool without socks."
150134,1,"The boots arrived before expected, which was good. The boots fit very good and I wear them almost every day.Couldn't have a better pair."
298425,1,"I really haven't had these boots long enough to rate anything other then the comfort, I got them for Christmas this year 2012 and have only wore them a few times up until now but, I have to say even though they aren't broken in yet, they're one of the most comfortable boots I've ever worn. My wife and I went into the city on the day before New Years eve to do some shopping and see a movie and I wore my new Elk Trackers to try and get them broken in, we were gone from 12 noon until 9:30 that night and my feet felt as good or better than if I'd worn my regular foot ware. I figured because the boots weren't fully broken in my feet would be killing me by the time I got home but, surprisingly that wasn't the case. They fit perfectly, I was told before I ordered them to get a size bigger because they are a tight fit but I didn't take that advice and ordered my size and the fit is right on. All I can say is if your thinking about getting these boots get your size and you won't be sorry, you'll have a very comfortable boot for, I expect, a very long time."
238173,0,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
23540,1,My husband bought them for our vacation at the river and he has enjoyed the from breakfast to dinner. He wishes he could wear them to work
104681,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
126054,1,"I got these boots for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves, loves them. He has sensitive feet and is discriminating when it comes to shoes, but he says his feet feel great in these all day. They are very high quality and made in the USA, which makes them worth the price."
125868,1,"Bought these for my son who is a law enforcement officer, he really likes them."
295583,1,"OK, I thought that these things were going to be OK, my wife raved about her pair for weeks now. They are actually pretty great. I just got back inside from shoveling out long driveway which is always a hazard due to the section with a pretty steep slope. It's an extreme hazard when we get snow on top of ice, like this morning. I'm slipped and fallen several times shoveling that slope. With these things on I didn't slip one millimeter. The traction on snow and ice, even on wet ice is incredible. It's essentially like walking around with a lot of cleats on your shoes.A word of caution though, these will be VERY slippery on a glazed tile floor, and will damage most other kinds of floors. Wear them outside ONLY. They give good traction on ice, wet ice, and snow. They don't slip on dry concrete, or our flagstone walk.I saw a review where someone said that they are fragile. My wife has been using a pair for weeks in sub zero temperatures, and she hasn't caused any wear on hers yet. This is the first time I used mine, and they seem pretty tough. If the were any tougher it would be very difficult to get them on a pair of shoes. Also, I don't care if I go through a couple of these a season, they are inexpensive and a LOT better than falling and breaking a wrist or anything else.all in all, a great value. We will probably be getting more."
129567,1,"This has been my first dedicated running shoe in a while. I would say that I have been very pleased with this shoe. It is light, flexible, and very comforable. I suppose that a hard core runner could recomend a better shoe for 3 or 4 times the price, but for a shoe around $50, this is fairly good."
74277,1,"Bought these for my son, and he adores them. He wears them all weekend long, and switches to them as soon as he gets home from school. Comfy, and easy to take off and put back on ..."
184873,0,I was upset when I got these shoes because I needed them to go on vacation and did not have time to order another pair. These shoes run a size small. I wear a size 10 and my heel was hanging off the end about a half in and they were too narrow.
200283,1,"THE SHOE TO HAVE FOR ALL YOUR BOATING NEEDS, SPERRY, ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES. nOT ONLY DO THEY GO GREAT WITH SHORTS AND A TOMMY BAHAMA SHIRT, BUT THROW IN A DOUBLE BREASTED BLAZER WITH GOLD BUTTONS AND YOU GOT YOURSELF A PARTY, WEEKEND AT BERNIES STYLE"
88945,1,"I purchased a large cedar shoe tree to help maintain the condition of my newer Bostonians (size 11). The shoe tree fits snugly within the shoe, helping to smooth out creases in the leather without stretching out the shoe. I have only been using them for a month or two at this point, but so far they are functioning as indicated. I am very satisfied with my purchase and plan to purchase another set when I replace an older pair of shoes."
168885,0,"I guess I will be keeping this pair, I need them for an event and it's too late to go looking elsewhere. It's seems comfortable--basic style and for women like me who can't tolerate heels, it's a nice dress option. But it's advertised on Amazon as leather and it's not leather, nor is it going to fool anyone."
249677,1,I absolutely love Kenneth Cole Reaction shoes. They are really stylish and always comfortable. This style is perfect for work with dress pants and skirts or for a night out on the town with jeans. I bought them in black and oak (which is a perfect shade of brown-not too dark and not too light). I have finally found some cute pointy toe heels that don't kill my feet.
211827,1,I don't have to worry about cleaning them. I just put a little polish on them and they are good to go!!
89051,1,"I've purchased these boots multiple times, they've held up in all weather as long as I polish them consistently. I wear them for work with a suit and they're professional with a little edge."
87676,1,"The fit is GREAT. The quality could be better, but at that price you can buy a new pair every month."
119160,1,"I've purchased these slippers for years, so I knew what I would be getting. They are the best for flexibility and for showing point."
166414,1,"I PURCHASED 3 PAIR OF DIFFERENT STYLES OF Neil M Men SHOES. THEY ARE VERY COMFORTABLE, ALL LEATHER, GREAT QUALITY AND WEAR LIKE A $150 PAIR OF SHOES. THESE SHOES RUN TRUE TO SIZE. I WAS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE FIRST PURCHASE BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF Neil M Men SHOES, BUT FROM THE FIRST TIME I WORE THEM I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. I WILL BUY ANOTHER PAIR WHEN I FIND THEM ON SALE AGAIN AND WOULD ADVISE ANY ONE TO PURCHASE THEM.BTW... I RESEARCHED Neil M Men's SHOES AND FOUND THAT THEY ARE SOLD BY MANY DEPT STORES, INCLUDING NORDSTRORM'S DEPT. STORES"
134748,1,"I was so confused to what size I should get. I looked up a bunch of reviews and I got a mix of getting a half size smaller to a full size smaller. I have a friend that has a pair and she told me to get a full size smaller. I wear a 6.5 in women's shoes, and a size 5 in boys. I got a size 4M in big kids. They fit perfectly. I'm glad I got a full size smaller. My toes just barely hit the front of the shoes and I can still wear socks. I suggest you get a full size smaller. Timbs do run really huge. They are great quality and the shipping was quick. Happy with my purchase!"
73550,1,I have flat feet and have trouble finding shoes that are comfortable.The bone on the side my foot would hurt and nothing seemed to help. I bought a lot shoes in hopes of getting some relief. It seems that every pair could use a little adjustment of one form or another. That was until I bought the Eastland Newports. I am on my third pair. They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. When your feet hurt you are not able to fully function. Get these so you can quit thinking about your feet. If you have wide feet or bunions I recommend these shoes.If you are on your feet a lot these shoes will make you happy.
228510,1,"I bought this pair of converse for my daughter, and she loves them. They are so comfortable to wear and great quality as well."
183324,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."

386028,1,"I have owned various pairs of this model shoe over the last 8 years. Every year or so I'll just buy another pair...they are the perfect shoe for jeans, shorts, or khakis.Frat-tastic!!"
139568,1,"I was hoping to order these in 10 1/2, but that appeared to not be an option. I have a difficult time with many shoe manufacturers not offering my size. I use extra inner soles & that helps, but I wish my size was available."
217060,1,This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase
330892,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
331836,1,"Super comfortable, I got these in this color because they were cheap. I mainly use them for walking around the barn and after I'm done riding horses and want to switch into something other than my boots."
231046,0,"These shoes were so highly reviewed that I got them, but to be honest they are no more comfortable than any other work shoe I have ever had, maybe even less so for a nurse shoe. They seem sturdy though, so I am hoping the fact that they are average in comfort will not matter because they last a really long time. Fingers crossed."
32769,1,"These must be the cutest boots I have ever bought, seen, imagined for my totally pink daughter.She didnt want to put them on at first and I was so so disappointed. Now when she sees them she loves wearing them because of the big girl heel which isnt really high. Just high enough to make her feel grown.Well worth the price. Quality seems just as great as in pic."
236648,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
316633,1,Have owned the white shoes in this style and love them. Was not aware they had black. I got them and they are just like the white. I have no doubt they will perform like the white version.
84977,1,"This is my second pair of Keen Newport shoes and they are my favorite shoes! You will not find a more comfortable pair of walking shoes. I bought my first pair before a trip to Washington D.C. On this trip I averaged 8 miles a day of walking and my feet were fine. This summer right before a trip to New York City I ordered my second pair. This shoe is for an average width foot, do not order this shoe if you have a wide foot."
148818,0,"This is a beautifully classic shoe and quality is nice. The heel composition is the exception. It is a hard, hard plastic or rubber. It is very slippery on tile or brick floors. Be careful. As other reviewers indicated, the sizing is off. Consider ordering a half size larger."
275678,1,"These boots are an excellent value. They are comfortable, provide great heel and ankle support, good grip, and keep your feed warm and dry in cold climates.Purchased a pair for a vacation in New Brunswick, Canada. These boots kept my feet dry and comfortable the whole time, even while snow shoeing and hiking across a snow covered beach front. Didn't slip once in them, though I encountered ice a few times.Very good purchase!"
149140,1,"Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes. Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes, so I was pleased. I do have hammer toes, and got a few red spots on top of my toes, but I don't know how I could have avoided that."
249003,1,the combination of black and white is versitial and its workable
237876,0,"When i saw it online i was happy with the shoe that i got it and was nice,but the sizes are small so you will need to get a biger size then normal."
217338,0,"The shoes were better than I expected. Going by the reviews for this product, I was expecting a lot of dark spots on the leather, but surprisingly there were none. :-)However, the shoes are a little tight and narrow for me. I hope it improves as they are worn more often."
162604,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
200865,1,"Shoe is nice but was disapointed that the dye from the shoe gets on my socks,it was suprising as my feet do not sweat. This is not a good thing.Will not consider this color next time..."
218006,1,"I like black sneakers best because you can pull them off going to casual social things like neighborhood parties, cookouts, etc. and they dont look dumpy.these are comforatable and break in nicely."
350112,1,These shoes were delivered quickly and were exactly as descibed. Very comfortable from the first time out of the box. Highly recommended.
304091,1,"I purchased these boots in white (size 8) to wear with my Halloween costume. You can't beat the price (I paid $27.00+free shipping). The quality is good and they are comfortable. If you have skinny calves like mine, these will be great for you. They fit a little less than snug, but compared to how boots usually swallow my legs whole, I was happy. A word of caution - because these boots have a glossy finish, they will scuff easy. Also, the first time I put them on to ""break them in"" (which they didn't really need) they seriously scuffed up my lanolium floor. The black scuffs came up easily enough, but you may consider taking a quick stroll down the sidewalk to scruff up the new black soles before you go scuffing someones floor. Overall, I love the boots and will keep them for future wear."
29118,1,"I love that Minnetonka has stayed true to itself. These mocs are just as they have always been...perfect! I bought them for &#34;grounding&#34;. I wear them to walk my dog and being out in the yard. So, comfy. Thinking about getting another pair in a different color."
267159,0,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
50097,1,"I loved my shoes, brand new, in box, great product, fast shipping. Thanks so much!"
231606,1,"These are really cute shoes and comfortable. The straps can be a tad bothersome until they are broken in a little and stretched to conform with your foot, but it didn't take much time to do that. I have a couple of pairs and really like the way they look on my feet."
380791,0,"I normally wear an 8.5 (wide, if they have it) so I ordered these shoes a 1/2 size up (and wide) from other reviews suggestions. Welp...it still wasn't enough. These shoes definitely run small, and with hindsight I would have ordered a 9.5. Because it's too small, and because I'm too cheap to send them back, I will wear them anyway and just suffer a little bit from the pinching on the top side of my foot and toe box area. They are very cute though, and the heel is low enough to walk a moderate distance, but tall enough to add a little length to the legs. I took a risk by buying shoes I had never tried on before online, and it was almost a good idea."
370672,1,"I was very pleased to get these shoes, they're very iconic no matter where you go and look great with just about any casual outfit. But after about 10 months of having these, rips between the rubber parts of the shoe and the cloth began to seperate. I'm not sure whether this is due to how my feet fit within the shoe. After trying to fix the seams myself, the shoes soon began to just fall apart really and just became really unwearable. If they were cheaper I would consider getting a second pair and maybe another different pair of shoes along with them. Overall they're still nice shoes, but they may need to be pampered somewhat for them to last a long time."
62591,1,Best fit I have had for these shoes would recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a soft play shoe..
121428,1,Its a black K-Swiss tennis shoe. This is a classic unisex style. I bought them for my 3 year old daughter. She loves them because daddy got em for her. I think I might get a pair for my self actually.Oh..and a pair for the wife too (maybe)
109613,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
307568,1,"I absolutely love these shoes, it was the first time I bought a pair of shoes online."
197864,0,"I purchased from the photo. was in a hurry that day. Glad they where the low ones he wanted. novelty item. My son wanted them , he is 30 yrs old. A fun item he used to have many years ago. the size recomendations was correct. 1/2 size smaller was just right.... Not the Hi Tops they state in the add."
132428,1,"I have CMT, 10 fused toes, 4 screws, a tendon anchor, and a missing fascia on one foot. After 5 surgeries in 2 years, I have been looking for dress shoes that would be comfortable for my not normal feet. They are nice to look at, and come with insoles that I could configure for each foot. The extra room for my toes and the wide toe box are perfect. They are light enough that I do not have problems lifting my feet off the ground and that should help eliminate some of my trip/fall issues.I have only worn them around the house, but after 40 minutes of being in them, they were still comfortable. Several other orthopedic brands hurt my feet within minutes of putting them on. They are cute and stylish, and are not clunky. I will be able to wear them for work and medieval reenactment.At the moment I am rating this a 4 out of 5. I am hoping to be able to upgrade that once I have had the opportunity to wear them for a full, busy day."
334260,1,These are the best shoes I have owned. This is my third pair. Just like wearing slippers from the first day. No break-in period.
143062,1,These sandals fit comfortably right from the start and can be worn indefinitely without any discomfort!
9697,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
63501,1,"I love these boots. A little stiff around the ankles at first, but broke in fast wearing them around for a couple of days. True to size and fit great. Waterproof, kept my feet dry when doing activities that normally get my socks soaked. Look cool and have great traction. Excellent value for the price and would definitely buy another pair whenever these wear out."
234711,0,The quality of the bag is not too good. And the color fades after a few washes.
131387,1,I wear a lot of flip flops and I can guarantee that Reef's are the best quality out there for your money. I had a pair for almost 5 years that kept up very well. Even thought I try other brands I know that I will always have a pair of Reef's in my closet.
8387,1,"Wonderful product, great quality! I just can't say enough about how much we love them! If you are on the fence about getting these, do it, you will not be disappointed!"
268389,1,"I was looking for a low cost, but stylish and comfortable shoe. I tried the malls and the outlets, but I still couldn't find IT! IT had to be black and comfortable, above all. Then one day while browsing through Amazon, I tried looking at Rockports, because I had remembered a pair of Rockports I had years ago. I saw the special price for these Calimesas and decide to take a chance....what could $ 44.00 buy me? Well, it bought me a very good shoe! Leather is great...a Rockport trait...as well as a comfortable fit. They're not a stylish as others I've seen, but the price is right and they have that Rockport comfort. Yes, they're made in China now instead of the USA like they used to be...but the quality is very surprising! Totally satisfied! This is really a great deal!"
32637,1,"This is a cute, good quality boot for a little girl. My granddaughter loved them. I would recommend them to anyone looking for an inexpensive, cute, durable boot."
266363,1,Pretty comfortable from day one. I wish I would have searched the web more. Found them 20 bucks cheaper after purchasing these.
18986,1,These shoes are awesome. They make my legs feel so good. There was not a break in time. Just felt great from out of the box. I recommend these to all who want an extra little something when doing your walking.
186080,1,"I gave these a five star based on price and performance. I purchased these boots for about 50% off at 50 dollars. They have served well in the snow- waterproof and warm. I probably would have liked the black color more if it was available. As a workboot, the only things lacking are a steel toe and an oil resistant sole. Overall a great shoe."
371922,1,I've been looking for that color a long time. I was about to custom make them from sears which they can personalize them on line. Very happy with the sneaker. Still looks good after having them twenty years ago
51449,1,"This is my 2nd pair of Propet walkers. I have the other pair that has mesh instead of solid leather, which are good for summer time but not winter when it's wet outside. I wanted a leather pair to keep the moisture out of my shoes when I'm outside & I do walk a lot so a good walking shoe is a must.I'm type 2 diabetic & was having some ingrown toe nail problems. After buying my 1st pair of these shoes, within 3 months I was able to get rid of the ingrown toe nail. The shoes have more toe room & are stable to keep my foot from rolling out when I walk. I was having lots of back pain, and if I don't get a good shoe like i said my foot rolls out & my ankles start to hurt.With these shoes I have no pain, am steady on my feet & the rubber sole is good to keep me from sliding around on wet floors: an added plus.I wanted to mention that these shoes are comfortable, they have a snug fit feel to them, but not so tight that your feet feel crammed. Earlier I was wearing these shoes because my feet were so swollen I couldn't get anything else on except slippers. These went right on, did not make my feet feel crammed, & with the heel pain I was having from the swelling i couldn't feel it.These are really some nice shoes, they are light weight & feel good after being on my feet all day walking around, even when I take the dog for a walk.I've cleaned out my closet of all the other favorite shoes I had, and only have these 2 pairs now. Nothing else can compare to how these feel for me & how well they keep my feet healthy."
250300,1,"wow. these shoes are awesome. they are extremely comfortable. not to mention the attention i have gotten from these (i currently own the blue ones) for instance people laugh and point out the good year insignia on the sides and back, and the distinct colors that these shoes are made in. these definitly attract attenion. and plus they just overall, look real neat. and they are unique. i am in high school, and i am the only person i know that has these shoes in a school of 2100 kids in omaha nebraska. trust me, these shoes are definatly ""hip"". haha."
148776,2,"I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past; however, the description on Amazon is incorrect. This is NOT a 3 pair pack, it is only one pair of socks for $13.99 plus shipping. What a rip-off. I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack"
252324,1,"I can always trust Franco Sarto shoes and their quality, but I especially love this shoe. It looks like a classy ballet flat but with the kitten heel, it adds a little more polish. They are very comfortable, and the mix of suede and patent leather on the heel adds a whimsical touch dressing it up. I loved them so much, I ended up ordering 2 more pairs. A bit pricey for a ballet style shoe, but the price is worth it for the wearability and comfort."
311221,1,"OK, they aren't the most fashionable looking. But they are comfortable and sensible. You can walk anywhere and not feel the pain afterwards, or during. I used them in NYC where you have to walk everywhere, need support, some folks actually asked me about these shoes. Perhaps the orange helps compensate for the not so stylish. I got rid of some sandals that are as thin as a wafer, and my feet thank me every day. Love your feet, they take you where you want to go."
1083,1,"I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks."
375453,1,These are a nice pair of casual work shoes. Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks. They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer.
147025,1,"My wife loves these boots! She wanted them for Christmas, and was so happy to receive them from Santa. Super warm an comfortable, and she won't take them off."
79681,1,"My daughter loved the shoes. They are good quality and reasonable price. The vendor sent the shoes on time. My daughter says they are ""very cool"""
42267,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
107082,1,I really enjoy purchasing from Amazon.com It has been a pleasure to do business with you. I always receive my purchases in substanial time. It is always in excellent condition when it arrives. Prices are very compatible with what the stores around our area sell for. I will continue making purchases from Amazon.comThank You Amazon.Renay
124504,1,"I have owned several boots from Kenneth Cole but this one rocks! Very slylish and sexy looking, goes great with dark jeans..almost like rockstar looks..I have gotten so many compliments for this boots."
199153,0,"I have absolutely loved this shoe. It is extremely comfortable and looks great. I just now encountered a problem with it though. Yesterday, after only having the shoes for a couple of months, a piece of rubber sole came off the bottom. I will have to find the right glue to reattach it. That is a shame because I really like the shoe."
311459,2,"Great price but lacks in comfort. These shoes are very narrow and I also find them a bit wobbly. Unfortunately, they are not worth returning to amazon for what I paid."
325205,1,Shoes feel great right out of the box. I've only had a couple of opportunities to wear them so far....and I'm very satisfied!
183021,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
340699,0,"I think Chuck's look cool, which is why I bought these, but I had no idea they were so uncomfortable. If you can deal with a shoe that has almost no cushion and no arch, then by all means get them (I still wear them every once in a while). But if comfort is a big thing to you, I would look elsewhere."
4270,1,"This is an excellent light-medium weight boot. I wanted to find a reasonably priced hiking boot for weekend trips. This boot meets all of my expectations. It is light but sturdy, waterproof but still ""breathes"" and it fits according to the size listed. This is not a heavy boot for large pack trips but should be more than enough for light trips.The seller delivered as promised and gave link for tracking. I would defintiely buy from this seller again."
114943,1,They feel comfortable and true to size. The black and white go with everything. I'll be buying this same pair again.
209444,1,"True to size right out of the box. Extremely comfortable. Can even wear with dress pants (no problem). Overall, great boot. Ordered brown as well after receiving these black ones."
155421,1,"This is a very light weight work shoe. I only wished it was a little wider. I love the heel height butthe back could have been made a little higher. It sits very low on the ankle. The company logo""Eastland"" (green tag) should not be glued on to the shoe. The Eastland logo is inside the shoe and that should suffice. I tried removing the tags but its either sewn onto and also glued. We have strict dress coderegarding shoes being black without any logo's showing. I didn't want to risk damaging the shoes by removingthe green tags so I had to color it all black with a permanent marking pen. But I do love the look of the shoes. The heel gives me a bit of height"
91792,1,"Came with ""foam/cardboard"" shoe tree, decent price, comfortable, stylish. It is a good purchase. Just need to wear it for a while longer to see how well it last."
228715,1,"Shoes arrived in wonderful shape; packaged well; exactly what I ordered.However, we ordered the wrong size. Return went well; advised my account would be credited for purchase price only; but there was no stock available nor could they tell me when they would receive more in the size we needed. If you need a specific size, order it ASAP."
230227,1,"I'm on my second pair of Boccas and I love them.I have a wide foot and these fit perfectly.to the person who gave 1 star. I will agree that they run a teeny bit small... but only 1/2 size, not a whole size. the 9s i have fit like other 8-1/2s fit. I have noticed that if i wear them the day after (or later in the day after) wearing heels or any other shoe that irritates my foot a bit, they fit tighter. other shoes make my feet swell, so the Bocca fits a bit more snug.No matter how many other shoes I buy, they always end up in a box ready for donation while I go to back to the Bocca."
297543,1,"I wear these everyday and I find them very comfortable. I have had them for almost a year and they are holding up pretty well. They have a bit of a funky texture on the upper and don't take polish very well, but they are still very solid and look good."
223827,0,"The ad showed a picture of the shoes with dark gray stripes, but the ones they sent were solid white; I can live with the color difference, but the shoes seemed to fit kind of tight and were hard to break in, so you may want to order a larger size in this one."
38105,1,"I have wanted a pair of Doc Martens for the longest time,but simply cannot afford them. Then while browsing Amazon,I found theses skechers,and figured I would give them a shot. I am so glad I did. They are stylish,well made,and most important,sooo comfortable. They are half the price of doc martens,and in my opinion,a much better shoe. Highly recommended !!!!"
282129,1,"Great! Bought it for my husband, can't stop him from wearing them every day. They look elegant with short and long jeans, even with cool khakis."
77027,1,"1/26/2010 I purchased one pair of the 802 which is almost exactly like the 801. The bottom of the sole on the 802 is slightly different and the 802 came in black and hot pink with a small amount of a mesh type fabric on the top of the toe area. Other than this the 802 is the 801. I purchased the 802 sometime last spring and liked them so much that I purchased 2 more pair and put them away in case this shoe is discontinued. They are extremely comfortable. I really use them to wear around the house. Obviously, the slip in style is convenient. There is a review of March 2008 giving the shoe 2 stars which I don't understand. I don't know what this person was using the shoe for, but it makes no sense. If you can find them, good luck, I can't imagine that you won't be happy with them. I just purchased for my fiance the 801 mens which arrived yesterday. He has never worn a slip in before, but he liked the concept of my 802 so I thought I'd get him a pair. He opened the box late yesterday afternoon, put them on and that was that. I think he might be sleeping in them! Again, if you can find them, you will more than likely really like them."
104695,1,I've been wearing this shoe for years. It has always been very comfortable and long-wearing.
73797,1,"My son loves them! So confortable, easy to use, easy to clean and dried super fast.... it's our best sandals ever for summer time! Of course Amazon put them in our door as fast as always!"
299637,0,"I have the genuine leather ones, and I see that these say they're faux leather..apart from that,they look identical to mine, which I acquired when someone on a parent cyber forum decided to sell off some mint-condition Birkies in my size.Well, so I was pleased by the arch support etc and wore them home...but had to stop and take them off with big blisters. After that, I was leery...but now i've gone back to them. Again, they are wonderfully supportive of your foot but SO painful on top where the uppers chafe against the skin, no matter what setting you have the buckle at, so you have to carry around boxes of bandaids, and even so my right foot is very red and tender a day later, and I am deliberating whether to give up on this 'breaking in' experiment/torture.i'm not sure why the uppers can't be made super-soft in some way, but it's a real shame because it lets the shoe down. I should think the rigidity of the soles, and the weight they have, makes the problem worse. I've now tried wearing them a number of times, and I don't see any improvement. I may give up on these shoes now. I'm not one of those who walk around in socks and sandals...just looks awful."
245148,0,"Great looking shoes, husband loves these and finds them very comfortable .. Run true to size - gets a pair or two every year!12/27/21 Well they still are a good looking shoe BUT my husband wore them for the first time this morning and the top of both shoes started peeling and cracking -within first hour of wearing!! Be warned something is up with the ""leather"" ..I read some other reviews seems we are not the only one who has had this problem!"
90689,1,I sit at a computer all day. My left leg was getting bloated and painful. These stockings work just as described. The swelling is gone and the sharp pains are nearly gone. They are nearly identical to the prescription stockings sold at pharmacies.
312745,1,i received the crocs 2 days after i ordered them. what a pleasant surprise. they fit beautifully and are sooo comfortable. this is my 3rd pair of crocs this year. i wear them everywhere. i highly reccomend them.
325818,1,This was a gift for my granddaughter. We could not find her size locally.
122126,1,have never bought any shoes on this site so have no idea why they have showed up in this items bought
107572,1,"These shoes are so good looking and comfortable, too! I highly recommend them. They arrived quickly and all was good."
322423,1,"Beautiful shoes, leather, fit, color...alll perfect! I got these for my dancing niece and she loves them! A beautiful performance!!"
338834,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
292246,1,You can't find a better made boot than this one.I have been in the trades for 25 years and have tried alot of boots out.None have compaired to thorogoods!!(and they are made in america)Quality and american made with pride.I'M SOLD FOR LIFE. You can also resole them!!A+
218726,1,"The purchase took place as expected in estimasdo time, and with respect to the product announcement being sold agrees with what is expected without any complications or problems arise"
44353,1,I got 4 letters 4 you P-I-M-P
231196,0,"I ordered three pairs of these over a space of three weeks. I finally got the size I wanted. My experience is that they are a full two sizes larger than what I wanted. I went from a size 13 to a size 11 1/2 before getting it right. The quality is outstanding and with the discounted price it was worth it to return two pair (sizes 13 and 12). Problem is that Amazon does not have a return category for ""does not fit"" and so I had to pay the return shipping. That's OK, at the price of the boots, it was still a steal!"
260351,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
333405,1,These shoes have been some of the best I have ever bought. I have been wearing this brand shoes for many years and to find them at this price was great.
34070,1,"Love these shoes - could not find them in ther stores in my area. They hae every color but white. Have a pair but they are really old and wanted a pair that looked nicer. The shoes are comfortable and they look a little more dressy than the normal tennis shoe. Paid a little more than the price at our stores but, they are worth the extra cost."
33303,1,I love Easy Spirit walking shoes. They aren't a sneaker and don't look like one but that is what they feel like - very comfortable!
45392,2,"Disappointing is the word I'd use to describe this purchase. I had a pair of identical shoes that were about 8 years old. They were pretty worn but I had enjoyed wearing them so much I bought them again.The leather on this shoe is not nearly as soft. Also, there was so much shoe polish on the shoes that it seeps through the leather and if you wear light-colored socks for more than a couple of hours you will take off a pair of socks with brown shoe polish all over them. I've ruined two pairs of socks already thinking that it was just a slight remnant of the assembly process.I'm going to wear them a few more times in hopes that the leather softens up and the polish diminishes but I've already worn them for about 40 hours and there has been little improvement to either problem."
43318,1,I have been a loyal customer of the ASICS GT-line for over 10 years and I have not yet been disappointed.
305682,1,Rockport shoes are always very comfortable. My husband has trouble fitting his right foot because of an injury but always find that the prowalker is true to size and a good value for a walking shoe.
315711,1,"The 10.5B fit exactly. I ordered based on being fitted and using other shoes from high quality store, ie. Johnson Murphy, Cole Haan & previous purchased at store: Floresheim.Nice style for relax or work."
8201,1,I've been wearing Wolverine Work Boots for more than 10 years and have had nothing but great luck with them. They are very comfortable and they last a long time. I personally like the Durashock boots but I've owned both types and they are all great. You won't be disappointed.
335701,1,"crocs Classic Clog,Black,Men's 9 M/Women's 11 M; I never thought I would see the day I would by crocs! I think it might be middle age, and my back injury, lol. They are decently comfortable and easy to slip on and off.They also clean easily in the sinkThe sizes are near exact so if you wear a half size, like 10 1/2, order an 11."
298699,0,"Came on time, store did a great job getting my order to me on time.The shoe on the other hand seems to be made more for a man than a women.The strap does not stay forward, if you decide to wear them without the strap in the back.I have an old pair of these crocks and they are just not the same."
21567,0,For some reason it was not the right size so I am rating it 3 Stars because of that. The shoe itself looked well made but the aggravation of having to return the shoes and therefore not keep them makes this 3 Stars (average) rating. Please do not let this rating deter anyone from buying the right size. Thank you.
289265,1,I have been a Rockport consumer for many years and have never found better products for comfort and value. The fact that the wide model fits my feet extremely well with no heel slippage is great. The Prowalker is definitely a very fitting name as I do a lot of walking. Amazon.com does a fantastic job in delivering the product and keeping the customer informed; I ordered the shoes on a Friday and they were delivered the following Wednesday.
282097,1,I seriously love these shoes. so comfortable. I really don't know how much I can personally write about a shoe but this pair makes me feel like rambo and brad pitt all at the same time.
6573,1,this was a very good product the fit was good and it came in when it was supposed to all pricing was correct
307323,1,"I plan on wearing this show hiking in Costa Rica. I will update this review with my experiences. I wanted a hiking shoe that could dry quickly in a humid jungle environment, offer foot protection from thorns, and offer decent sole support.About the shoe:This is really a sandal with a proper hiking sole. I am surprised by how heavy duty the sole is - nearly an inch thick, and with greater cushioning than any tennis shoe. The sole performs wonderfully well whether you are carrying a 20 lb pack or walking around with no weight.The upper is extremely well constructed. It will not break and is built to last. See other reviews for the durability of the shoe - one reviewer logged 1200 miles in these.Could not be happier with a shoe for hiking."
105775,1,"Quick shipping, and no problems at all. They have all the colors so you can mix and match"
204935,0,"If you plan to use this thing in your hotel room at night to dry boots or gloves, better pack earplugs also!It blows cool air into the boots and dries eventually. Have used it with the AC adapter, expect the batteries would not last too long and make the until quite heavy."
68134,1,I have owned a pair of these shoes for over 3 years now and am currently going to buy the exact same pair again. I am a nurse and spend hours on my feet and these are the most comfortable shoes I've found. They've held up great! You'll love them too!
166403,0,"I own three pairs of boots made by Double H, all Packers, so I obviously like them a lot.This is my third purchase of the boots. My first was the 9622 which is, sadly, no longer made: I love them and wish Double H would bring them back.In fact, this boot style the 9625 is the replacement of those but I far prefer the 9622's.What guided my buying choice were the following five factors: Waterproof, Made in USA, Price, Comfort, Quality.Price first: These boots are an overall good value.Country of Origin: It is increasingly difficult to purchase boots made right here in the good old USofA and I've about given up on making this a priorty. In fact, my most recent purchase was of Carolina boots that I thought were made here; alas, they are in nearly all sizes but mine. Sheesh.Waterproof: I need waterproof boots, these are supposed to be waterproof, but I do get a surprising shot of water every now and again when I splash water up onto the tongue area.Comfort: This particular pair of boots has just never broken in to a comfy fit; a year later a toe on my right foot still gets sore before a full day of wear. This bugs me.One nice thing about them is that they wear a bit cooler than the model 9635 Gel Packers by this company that I also own. This is especially nice because I wear boots year round and appreciate the relative coolness of this pair.Quality: Part of the reason that I want Made in USA products is that I want high quality. These boots are high quality. I've owned them for about a year with no apparent quality problems.Note that I wear boots on a daily basis and never wear these two days in a row.I recommend these boots with reservations as noted."
123830,0,"This shoe is aesthetically superior to anything on the market, particularly the latest version, a unrivaled gem which sports a navy blue faux-suede. If you don't actually want to PLAY basketball in these, definitely get a pair.However, if you're using the shoe for its intended purpose, I hope you have narrow feet and strong ankles. As a huge fan of the original T-Macs (didn't get the T-Mac 2's because they were too narrow), I was hoping that the 3's would restore my faith in the shoe. I'm a serious baller - I play just about every day and participate in 3 corporate/city leagues.That being said, after only owning these shoes for just three few weeks, I had to return them because I sprained BOTH ankles (never happened with the T-Mac 1's) AND severely bruised my medial and plantar nerves (never happened in my life - ever). Though ankle injuries are all too common in basketball, these injuries did not occur in the typical &quot;landed on someone's foot&quot; fashion, which is cause for serious concern. I consulted my podiatrist on the issue and she informed me that my shoes provided poor support and suggested I look into a pair of New Balances.Additionally, the outside of the shoe will dig into your ankle if you lace your shoes up tightly, as there is no cushioning around the top rim of the shoe.Proceed with caution - do not be wowed by looks, particularly if you need support or have wider feet."
160042,1,"I bought these for powerlifting, as an alternative to much more expensive lifting shoes. They are legal in the organization I lift in, and they are exactly what I need. The flat, thin sole is perfect for squatting and deadlifting with stability and safety.I could see durability of these shoes being a problem IF they were worn as an everyday shoe, i.e., outside, or to work / school. The canvas material is thin, and this is by no means a rugged pair of shoes. But for what I uses them for - strictly in the gym - they are excellent."
257009,1,Great shoes. I wear an extra wide for Rheumatoid Arthritis but returned for just a wide because they stretch.
208649,1,"I've been a longterm Redwing Boot wearer. I decided to give these boots a try, because there price was about half what you would pay for a pair of Redwings. After wearing the boots for several months I am very impressed. They are just as comfortable as my Redwings were. I've noticed that the leather on the boots isn't quite as tough as what was on the Redwings though, and tends to take deap scratches easier. Only time will tell for sure though."
379384,1,I'm very happy with my purchase. Columbia is a good brand and this boots fit just perfect. I recommend buying this product.
186076,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
80002,1,Not what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised once they arrived. Delivery took forever because of the processing of the order...
331059,1,"Much like some of the other reviews I found they do run a little large. I'm usually a 9.5 (my barefoot measures 10 inches) so I ordered the 9 and they fit perfectly with enough room for socks. The colour is darker than the pic (I ordered tobacco) but I read that in another review so was expecting such. They are more like milk chocolate brown. I also have large calves and these are fine. Bit snug around the top but not uncomfortably so, I'd imagine being leather they will stretch a wee bit too. Will update when I have worn them a bit and exposed them to a New Zealand winter and see how they hold up."
309475,1,"I have plantar fasciitis and these are simply the most comfortable shoes. When I wear these all the time, I have no problems with my plantar fasccitis. Highly Recommend!"
302691,1,"I bougt it for my husband, he wears a size 14, but 13 crocs fit him fine. Although this one is a little too small, but crocs are always crocs :)"
187415,2,"I have had Uggs before and loved them. The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs. However, these black uggs are a big disappointment. The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty. Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone. I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown. My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there's never bled the black color onto their feet. Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would've returned them."
236168,1,"Purchased these boots for backpacking. So far I have backpacked across the Grand Canyon in these boots. There are holding up great, excellent traction in all conditions. Well made with great ankle support. They are a little heavy, however they appear well made. Comfortable. I would recommend these boots for the serious hiker, not you typical walking the trail boots."
301291,1,"I bought these shoes in a 10EE size but should have bought a 9EE. The width makes the difference in fit.Inserts have allowed me to wear them. I love them so much, I did not want to return them and reorder.They add a dash of color when I am wearing jeans. Very nice casual shoes."
180408,1,"I got these shoes for my boyfriend, and there was absolutely NO other place that had these in his size!! I ordered them, and they came in WAY earlier than I expected! Even earlier than the shipping expectancy! Ill buy Chucks from here for now on!"
86358,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
215193,1,"I am on my fifth pair of these sandals, yes 5th. pair!! they are the BEST!!!! Bought my first pair in Old Branson, Missouri and in love with them ever since,hope they never discontinue these planning on purchasing another pair,like to have an extra pair on hand!!!"
370900,1,"Great! Large size 16, cheap, comfortable and my fiance will look great wearing these shoes at our wedding. Thank you!"
257641,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
335848,1,I love these crocs. Soooo comfortable. There is plenty of room in the toebox for those like me with painful feet.
142915,1,"I bought a pair 2 years ago. Been to the beach, fishing, shopping and even to work! The double strap makes the sandal more secure than average flip-flops and all the colors offer a wide range of choices. You will love these!"
365246,1,"Very nice shoes, true to size and nice colour. I got a lot of compliments for them. I strongly recommend them to young people."
374190,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
372976,1,"My granddaughter absolutely ""...had to have, more than anything in the world..."" a pair of Converse Purple High-tops for Christmas! Ordered them on 12/19 & they arrived on the 22nd, in plenty of time for me to once again be ""the greatest grandpa in the world""!"
51856,1,"As someone who is more than a little bit over weight, I've found myself experiencing foot issues in the last few years. I wanted to increase my exercise, but due to my foot issues, I was having a hard time pursuing that goal until I found the Propet Stability Walker. This shoe has worked wonderfully, providing excellent support and accommodating my custom orthotic insole. I no longer have any foot pain and walk several miles every day.This is my second pair of Propet Stability Walkers, and I've found that the second pair had really LOUD squeaking when I walked (due to the orthotics rubbing against the inside of the shoe). A little quick internet research and I found out that putting a little powder in the shoe solves the squeaking problem."
224944,1,"I've bought these Converse shoes (both navy and white) for my son. They came on scheduled time. He liked them, wear every day."
55005,0,Unfortunately these run a bit tight. Length is fine but width is actually tight. I wish I could fix this issue but I really do not want to have to send these back...
183523,1,I've been wearing this brand shoes for over ten years. They look like dress shoes but feel like sneakers. And the last a long time. Highly recommended!
113181,1,"Wearing a AAAA shoe, it is very difficult to find a nice shoe in such widths. I have purchased several pairs of this shoe in many colors over the years. Goes with both skirts and pants. Just wish it came in silver!"
110264,0,"I ordered the size that I usually wear in Saucony's (which I wear quite a lot). Since it is hard to find leather Saucony's I thought these would take me thru the winter months. Well, unfortunately they were way to wide for my foot and too long, as well. I had to return them. I have never had this problem with any of my previous Saucony's and was disappointed that I had to return them."
59230,1,"I bought these based on reviews. First pair of shoes I bought online just from reviews. I went off the sizing in other peoples reviews and they were correct. I bought a 12 and my feet are a 11 1/2. I wasn't used to high heel hiking boots so that was an adjustment. I felt as though I was stepping into Ski Boots. I bought them six days before needing to use them enough time to try them out and go to a local store to buy another pair (which I didn't need to do).You WILL need to break these in. Don't expect to go and hike in these without doing this. For me I broke them in by wearing them to work for three days straight. I work at a desk most of the day with a walk during lunchtime. I would say four days would have been ideal but the shoes were very comfortable during the hike minus the minor bruise i had on my heal because I wasn't use to high heal shoes. It was bearable though and I wrote it off to me not breaking them in enough (or breaking in my feet).These are gortex and waterproof and I tested them out with a wide brook crossing. There were some rocks that the water was running over and I was deep enough to cover my toes. My feet stayed as dry as advertised. The hike had all the terrain you would find. Soft needle filled trails, moss covered rocks, old dry brook beds, roots, steep slabs and gravel.Heres where the shoes loose the fifth star. Compared to more pricey boots the sold are very hard and I was wavering on the steep slabs that were slightly wet. They gripped but just barely. Some better soles would be solid such as my buddies. But and this is the big BUT - for a starting out hiker these are fine and would be FIVE stars for their purpose. I only spent around 80 bucks on these and my buddy spent over 200 on his.If you are interested in reading about my first hike my buddy blogs about all his hikes in New Hampshire. We hiked Mt. Potash in the White Mountain region. It was a great trail for a first hike or even an experienced hiker who wants to do a quick hike. It took us about two hours up and two hours down with about 1.5 hours stopped. [...]Overall I think I picked the best first book, I expect to use them for shoveling in the winter because they look nice enough for me to wear to work (Business Casual). Give yourself plenty of time to break these in I would say at least a week. If you haven't worn high healed boots before you will probably get a small bruise on the back of your heal. I think it is normal and it goes away as you wear them more. The support in your ankle is key for any harsher terrain and slab walking you will do in your hike."
67067,1,"I LOVE CHUCKS. Have them in many colors and styles! Have been buying them for years, and know what to expect. Sizing differences can be handled if you pick one size, usually one half a shoe size for tie ups, and one shoe size for slip ons."
80862,1,"It's the first time when I bought this type of shoe, but I'm telling you, I love it; comfortable, cool, nice, I can't take eyes off them; Yes I'm talking about ""CONVERSE"" by Chuck Taylor, baby."
30201,1,"Fue una muy buena compra, excelente calidad, tallas ideales, lindos dise&ntilde;os actuales. Recomiendo a todoas a comprar este producto, se llevar&aacute;n una buena sorpresa y le encantar&aacute; si es un regalo para alguien."
57321,0,"I have fat feet, and I wear a size 12 wide. I ordered the 12 E, and they were long enough and wide enough, but not &#34;tall&#34; enough. I couldn't get the tops of my feet crammed in them, even when I loosened the laces. There's just no stretch to the canvas. They seemed like they'd be comfortable if I could just get them on! So those of you with fat feet, get something else!Returning them was so easy though, and only took a few days."
32547,1,"This is the best bag for travel. There are three major compartments and each is large enough to accommodate a laptop. The bag is lightweight and stays clean and fresh. There are six zippered pockets for your passport, cameras, makeup, notes, brochures, maps, phones, pdas, and a change of clothing. The bag is also comfortable: even filled to the brim, it hangs nicely on the shoulder. Stylish enough to serve as a purse and yet it is low-key enough that it doesn't scream ""tourist!."""
66901,1,These are awsome. just like shown. shipping took a while but it was over christmas so it makes sense. Just as nice as the pictures showed! Love the new CHucks
138639,1,"I've never ordered sneakers off the internet, but I trust adidas and thank goodness these were true to size. I got blue, and the color is really light and not too ""girly."" There is a lot of ankle support, which some people don't like because you can't wear the lowest socks. There is also a lot of arch and heel support, which I always require because I have had a heel spur in the past. I'm a moderate runner--maybe 10 miles a week, and these have been great. Enjoy!"
33374,1,"I bought these for my 9 year old son. He is very sensitive to shoe fit, so finding something he will wear can be a bit of a trial.I had him try on numerous different brands and styles hoping to find something which would provide sufficient support for a rapidly growing body while fitting comfortably enough to be worn regularly. All of the others that we tried were flip-flop flat (no arch support to speak of and a nearly flat sole) and/or had rough stitching on the straps that rubbed.Teva seems to realize that kids' shoes need to have the functionality and support of adult sizes. The other brands and styles that we looked at did not instill confidence that they would be suitable for daily wear by an active child...hiking, jumping, hopping, leaping, running...while the Teva Hurricane 2 appears to be ready for anything."
133161,0,Sent it back because it made my feet look even bigger. Did not fit well either. The support was comfortable but did not like the look on me.
202992,1,"Goods received on time and in excellent condition, would certainly buy again. Thanks!!!"
250549,1,I always buy easy spirit shoes because they are so comfortable and fit my arch perfectly. I love these and will keep buying them.
379422,0,"Questionable quality, already beginning to look worn out in less than a month. I expected much more for the price paid."
73751,1,"I personally prefer to buy a leather shoes for the small feet, but for the summer it is really good. Plus they learn how to put them on very quickly."
101644,2,"after only 2 months the shoe sole fell apart. Then the stitching on the side of the shoe came loose. I have worn Justin boots for over 25 years(same type of ropers - different colors). I have never had a defective boot like this. I called and e-mailed papa shoe, They said I had to return it to the justin the manufacture. If I would have bought it at Cavenders or Sheplers, They would have exchanged the boot and did the return for me. I called Justin, They told me to mail my boots in to them and it would take up to 6 weeks to get a response. I will not buy from Papa Shoe again."
208414,1,"I first heard of Keens when studying at an outdoor science station last summer. A number of my classmates had them and raved about how comfortable they were and how readily they were able to meet the elements. I was impressed, but found the $100 price tag daunting.I then saw my outdoorsy brother wear them wherever he went. He never buys things of low quality, and so I knew they had to be good.When there was a big Keen sandal sale, I started looking for which Keen sandal I would like to buy. I read up on reviews stating how the KEEN Newport and Newport H2 tended to be hot, smelly, and unbreathable, so I decided to go with the Venice.The Venice turned out to be a great, breathable alternative to the Newport. I bought this shoe knowing that my feet get sweaty and that I would need more breathability.The Aegis Microbe Shield works wonders, as my other shoes tend to stink up easily and my KEENs haven't. Because of the Microbe Shield alone, I think the KEEN Venice has an edge over the Venice H2. I also like the more traditional waterproof leather straps (vs. the H2's polyester webbing) in its more traditional look and its ability to be worn into.The only cons have to do with my hard-to-manage feet (though the cons are still worth mentioning). If your feet are sweaty (like mine), after a long day of walking you'll start to feel the footbed sticking to your foot, which feels gross and uncomfortable.Though KEENs do tend to run wide, be aware that if your foot is extra wide, the sandal can be initially very uncomfortable -- the strap was chafing at the side of my foot. So, if you buy this shoe and feel that it's a bit too narrow, I'd recommend breaking them in with socks first (that's what I did and I'm glad). Regardless, the ingenious strapping system allows you to adjust the sandal, which, done even very slightly, can make a huge difference in comfort."
46680,1,"This boot is like having toasty pillows on your feet - so cozy, and perfect for chilly weather. And a really great, unique look. Good quality manufacture and materials. It was an impulse buy and is now one of my favorite winter shoes."
193088,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
36429,1,The quality doesn't look as good as I hoped - you can see the glue and a space where the base is attached. I bought these looking for something that might hold up a little better than the cheaper canvas shoes I usually buy at Target - hopefully they will last a little longer otherwise they may not be worth the price. On the other hand they fit just right and are very soft and comfy on my feet. I like the color and the lining and stitching look pretty good.
132874,1,"I ordered these recently ( November 2012) after a lot of research and buying several pair of other brands only to waste my money... These boots fit true to size. I am a size six and bought the size 6. They go on just the way a boot should with having to use the little loops to pull on and the ""popping"" sound you get when you heel slides in. The instep area is fitted like it should be too. They are so comfortable it is hard to believe. Wore them right off the bat to line dance in and they are awesome. I bought the black and they are beautiful. I will be ordering only Ariat from now on and plan on purchasing this same style in a brown color next. Break-in time is minimal and painless."
128332,1,"I have always found the ladies width on Ariat boots too narrow, and have had a hard time finding men's Ariat boots small enough to fit. The size 7 wide fit perfectly; very comfortable for everyday wear around the barn, running errands, and riding."
166972,1,"These shoes are well worth the price. They are comfortable, made of good leather, and stylish."
92888,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
199620,1,"After 49 years, I finally have a pair of shoes that convinced me to go out and buy another pair like them (but in a different color) and buy more shoes of that brand. I will not buy another pair of shoes that are not Earth shoes!I have a swollen nerve in one foot that prevents me from wearing high heels or any shoe that has a narrow toe box. The Earth shoes all have wide toe boxes that do not squeeze my toes. The Earth shoes are made with the heel lower than the toes which gives your calves a nice workout, but it also allows for a much more natural walking gait (like you are barefoot on soft dirt or sand). I can now walk and stand for hours without my feet hurting! I also have fairly high arches that receive good support in the Earth shoes.I have bought my daughter the same shoe as well as some Earth winter boots. She has also loved these shoes."
76100,1,"The shoes I purchased for my feet are confortable and realy look neat. These softspot sandal looks good with my outfit, standing and walking, and even when I sit. The service on packaging and shipping was great, the shoes came on time and was not late. Thank You!"
296309,1,"I love these boots. I get a ton of compliments on them. The design detail (buttons, heel overlay) make them appear much more expensive than they actually are. Very comfy, I can go all day in them without feeling like I'm wearing ""heels"". Sadly, these boots are not going to last very long. There is visable wear around the toe (scrapes, scratches) and I have already lost a button. Another button is loose. Nevertheless, I like them so much I'm willing to take my chances and purchase a pair in black."
269462,2,"I waited 6 months in order to give a fair review, and hoping somehow the soles would soften up and ""wear in"". But not happening. No softening up going on. The black color and style is fine but the sole is very hard and uncomfortable. These shoes are terrible, and maybe I got suckered with a knock off or something (no way to prove). I'm very disappointed with these shoes. I expected better from Rockports. Now I just have to ""make do"" with them. But maybe this is what $40 Rockports are. If you like even a hint of cushion in your shoes, these ain't for you. Instead of walking shoes they're more like ""walking"" shoes. If you walk a lot at work, these will kill your feet. This is my first ever extremely negative review of any Amazon item, but this is how bad these shoes are. Don't be regretting like me. Youre way better off buying athletic walking or running shoes. Peace out bro."
40846,1,"Definitely order at least 1 size up- they run small and seem very narrow. If you have a wide foot, then these probably are not for you. I am a 9 and ordered a 10, but I wish mine were a half size larger. I've only worn them a couple times and they seem comfy enough- I do notice the difference in arch support between these and my cheapo Target flip flops that needed to be retired this year. I would definitely buy these again, but I would order a size 11- a full 2 sizes larger than I normally wear."
272283,1,"The shoes looks like in the picture, except for the rubber sole. It looks a little bit ""yellower"" than expected"
28682,1,Product fit well and was comfortable and sturdy. My daughter wears them all the time.
222590,1,"muy buen producto, se concreto la transacci&oacute;n muchas gracias, mercancia en buen estado, la entrega demasiado rapida, vale la pena"
305098,1,"Shoes are different and take a bit of getting used to. So far, my back and legs feel better."
264366,0,"I had to return these boots because of the unfinished inner seam on the shaft. It rubbed my ankles adn felt uncomfortable. Thicker socks helped, but then felt it too tight in the foot. Overall, the boots looked great and were otherwise well-made. Would probably work well if you can wear with thick socks."
127949,0,"This has been a decent winter running shoe with plenty of stability, fair amount of cushion, and decent traction. My primary gripe has been the insert not staying in place and riding back in the shoe."
228142,1,Sweeet!...my boy is flipping over these. He wants to wear them everywhere - I drew the line at church.
284351,1,My fifth pair same quality as always. Used to buy for hipness. Now Podiatrist says never go barefoot. My new house slippers.
170123,1,"I really like these shoes. They look great. The only thing I would change is that they take a while to break in - they are not at all flexible. That sounds like they wouldn't be comfortable - they are, they just feel like new shoes - even after I've worn them 7-8 times."
107731,1,"I love these! Softspots knows how to make them comfortable right away. Yes, they come a little snug, but it gives them the ability to shape to your feet. Very attractive! Highly recommend!"
93374,1,"These sandals were just what I was looking for. They were a little tight when they arrived, but have now stretched out just enough. These will be a favorite this summer."
123970,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
387689,1,Crocs are the most cofortable shoe ever. I wear mine everywhere rain or shine. If your in need a clog and a sandal buy crocs.
182324,1,Great to just slip in but still a good foot bed that supports my feet.
206852,1,"I had the originals back in grammar school in 1969 & always loved them.I have gained weight in the ensuing years & needed a very supportive shoe, so I looked into these again.This is a great shoe with lots of support for very overweight people, & highly recommended for them."
63508,0,"My hiking involves work. As a UPS driver I step in and out of my truck about 180 times a day. On top of that I deliver a lot of apartments, up and down roughly 800-1000 steps a day. I hoped these boots would have been more comfortable based on other reviews. They do fit well and may be ok for a few hours but beyond that if you are on your feet all day I can't recommend."
310850,1,"shoes are very light, comfortable and good price from amazon. just the look is not as nice as otehr shoes i like , but for the use purpose, thay are great."
23212,1,"I own 3 pairs of Hunter's, and will never stop wearing them. I get more use of of these than any of my other shoes living in Pittsburgh where rain is frequent and snow is harsh. These are both stylish AND durable--quality rain boots if you ask me. I'd say that these boots run a little big, however if you're going to put either a liner or wear heavy socks with them (highly recommended), I'd go with your normal size. I'm not a fan of the liners that Hunter makes (I find them a bit tacky looking), but high wool socks will definitely do the trick in cold rain or snow. If you're looking for a fashionable rain boot that will last you forever (literally) BUY these! They are so easy to clean and also very convenient for walks to work in the rain/snow. I get compliments every time I wear these!Also an FYI: the ""glossy"" kind are VERY shiny in my opinion... Almost too much for a rain boot. I'd suggest going with the normal ones :)"
316714,0,"I love the previous pair of janet sandals that I purchased about 6 years ago, but the newer ones were not true to size overall for me. i was saddened to return what I thought was a welcomed replacement for my very worn favorite."
219414,0,"The Keds sneaker is a classic, same style as always, and worn by everyone. I was surprised, however, that they tend to run a little small! My foot is between 9.5 and 10 in size, so I bought 10, and I can't wear them with socks. I am trying to stretch them with shoe trees in hopes of being able to wear them more often. I have to say, that's a little disappointing."
220164,1,"I love these shoes! And after you get them broken in (takes a little while), they are adorable and comfy! But they are definitely not for people with wide feet. They seem to run a little narrower than shoes I normally buy. But they're fantastic shoes nonetheless!"
348020,1,"The best one. It looks great, the size I ordered was prefect for me! The product arrived perfectly to Colombia.I'm alsy willing to buy more sperry shoes"
123053,1,Sketchers have been the only shoes I have bought for years. They fit as though you have broken them in as soon as you get them and they last a long time. I really like these all white shoes. They look classy (as long as you keep them clean) and really pull outfits together. My only complaint would be that I can't figure out a way to get the tongue of the shoe to not scunch down. I have to keep pulling it up. I even ran the laces through the loop but that didn't help either. Maybe once I get them fully broken in.
376127,1,"They take a while to break in but once they do they are amazing, if not a tad heavy. I work in a prison and during extractions or even walking on wet cement or tile floors these boots are deadly slippy. I am going to get them resoled at a cobber with different soles. Also, they are not as waterproof as I had hoped. Popped sprinklers and my feet get wet in 3-4&#34; of water when others stayed dry in their Bates and Rocky's."
77635,0,"Ordered 2 pair in 8.5 wide; way too small. I reordered 9 medium because all wides were sold out, but this one too was too small, so I gave up. Great quality, but research the sizing before you order...I apparently didn't do a very good job at that. If you already have Trotters and know your correct size, the price is right."
346530,1,I love these shoes! They added to my new years eve outfit. I'm soo glad that I used amazon.com to find them. Took me a long time of looking to finally find these shoes and at a great price.
165617,1,"I know I wear these shoes more often than I should, there are days when I should probably wear dressier shoes, but I wear one of my pairs of Easy Spirit Motions Sport Lace-ups everyday because they are so comfortable. They seem quite durable too."
269596,1,"I was looking for a good walking shoe--at a reasonable price, for I have read that price has little to do with quality in a good brand.Rockport's last fit my feel best of any brand I've used.This pair is satisfying me greatly woth everyday use."
370713,1,"Converse are great for your feet. They contain little padding, so you maintain a natural walking motion. Its basically one step above being barefoot. I actually use them to weight train. They are also very stylish. Who doesn't love converse?"
86406,1,I bought them as a gift for my husband and he really likes them. They are a little stiff and need to be broken in but other than that they are nice.
181087,1,"This shoes is one of the cutest I ever seen. It looks just like shown in the web. Unfortunately, for me this shoes run too big. I usually wear either 7 or 7.5. They don't have size 7, so, i bought 7.5 instead. It was waay too big. I was so sad, cause I do like this shoes so much. Unwillingly, I have to return it. If only they have size 7, I will definitely exchange it :(."
291836,1,"I bought these shoes for my mom, and she is the pickiest shoe shopper ever! She absolutely loves the comfort of these shoes and hadnt been able to find them for years! Good thing there is amazon! She hasn't been able to find shoes as comfortable! She says size are true to size, and she wants me to buy another two pairs! Good to know I've made my mom happy!"
89519,1,"Love my sandals, have them in brown, chocolate and white. Very much unhappy that MBT is no longer making this style. All of the MBT shoes tend to run a bit different than regular shoes on size. My Sport tennis shoes are 1/2 size larger, my Kisumu sandals are 1 size larger."
253974,1,First time using Amazon and my package cameRight away. Took about 5-10 business days andI have no complaints.
146111,1,tHESE BOOTS WERE THE FIRST THING ON MY GRANDDAUGHTERS CHRISTMAS LIST. cHRISTMAS MORNING WAS REALLY GREAT WHEN SHE GOT TO OPEN THE UGGS. THANK YOU FOR A GREAT WAY TO PURCHASE AND RECEIVE MERCHANDISE.
257652,1,"These pilot sun-glasses from the far east are one of my best buys. Had many other brands, more expensive, but the way these are put together, leave the super expensive and exclusive ones way behind. I tend to be very busy at work and these have held well. The lenses, frame, fitting and endurance show a good overall quality. Can't go wrong with this small investment!!!!!!!"
67282,1,"Sexy, tough ass looking.... THese are good for work or play. I love them, You can dress them up or down. Very nice"
123446,0,"These boots are well made and comfortable. They are reasonably warm, OK down to maybe -10 F, and waterproof as advertised. The zippers work really well.They are great for mud, snow and slush. However, the soles let go entirely as soon as they encounter any ice. My ordinary shoes perform far better. Now I have the choice of dry feet or broken bones."
170781,1,"These Boots are it! I bought a pair (Non-steel toe) about 10 years ago for working around my hobby farm. I loved them, but when I tried to get another pair a couple years ago, I found out they were out of production. Tried several other brands/styles since then with poor results - I work on concrete floors all day now and need something that feels like a walking shoe, but can handle oil spills and such. So, a few months ago while about to buy yet another brand, I looked for these Carolina's again, and much to my surprise, I found there are back!! I immediately bought a pair to see if they were the same. Not quite, but still better than any others I've tried.PRO:Glove leather-ish soft.Very comfortable sole that is flexible, not stiff as steel, VERY MINIMAL break in period.Very sturdy lace hooks (better than my first pair).CON:None yet."
7465,1,Estoy muy contento con mis nuevos zapatos. Estoy ansioso por las nuevas rebajas de Clarks
108322,0,"I had been looking for an SAS outlet online without success, and found these shoes which looked VERY similar, but cost about $40 less. I decided to try a pair and they are pretty comfortable but much tighter than the SAS shoes. I use a 9W in SAS and ordered a 9 C/D in the Softspot version, although the box they came in was labeled as the same size as 9W, the same size as the SAS. The Softspot shoe is smaller and tighter than the SAS, so next time I will order a wider or bigger size."
255742,1,I've been buying K-Swiss laceups for my daughter since she was first walking. They're very stable and are not so easy for her to remove as shoes with velcro. The teachers at her daycare really appreciate that! I had a good local discount source for these shoes but couldn't find a 5 -I was thrilled to find them on Amazon at such a reasonable price.
102610,0,"The title says it all. These shoes appear to be well-made. Lots of cushion and padding on the inside. But, as another poster has mentioned, they run small. My recommendation is to order them in a size that is 1/2 size larger than your normal shoe size. For that reason I gave them 3 stars."
129054,0,I bought these boots after reading reviews. I am not that impressed with them. I like that they are lighter than my danners and have the side zip which is a ten. These boots would be four stars if the insole was better. After wearing them for 2 ten hour shifts my feet hurt bad. There are no support provided from these boots and this is the first time the arches of my feet have hurt. I will be trying out Dr. Scholls or something to make the boots feel more comfy. I usually like 5.11 products but will not buy another boots made by them.
14339,1,"Bought these for our 15yr old son at the beginning of High Soccer season. Best soccer shoes he's ever owned. Made it thru August, Sept and Oct with either 2 hours of games or practices at least 5 days per week with minimal wear. The insoles were the first to go, however, he's still playing in the shoes over the winter because they are more comfortable than the Diadoras he wanted to try next. The shoes come with leather conditioner - we used it about every two weeks plus we kept cedar shoe trees inside the shoes when not in use. Some other brands may be a few ounces lighter, but I doubt you'll be as happy with them."
322341,1,I had similar shoes to these before I bought these. Theses are my replacements. They fit perfect and were shipped out quickly. I have no complaints.
351682,1,This seems to be the new fad in our school. My granddaughter askedfor them for her birthday and was very happy to receive them.
107810,0,"this is the second pair of softspots, but this pair the leather is not as soft it is stiff, and hopefully will be more comfortable when I break them in. The other pair exactly the same that I had purchased years earlier was and is so soft."
308178,1,We received the sneakers rapidly. They were just what we ordered and at a better price than I could find in the store.
144291,1,"Always the best! I love my new Minnetonka slippers! They are perfect for any winter situation, inside or out. The fit is perfect and the quality is too."
127334,1,Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine for that long. I've skated them for that long too. Super comfortable when they're broken in and will last you for years. Vans for life.
137157,1,"Don't know how many pairs ive owned over the years but I keep buying more. Comfy, stylish and cool to boot. I'd give a 5 but i wish they werent as expensive..."
293344,1,It is the fourth time I get Miura. Perfect for granite big wall climbing and for a day climbing also. Very comfortable and great adherence.
118117,0,"I realize dance slippers run small, so I ordered my niece an ENTIRE size up from her normal. Still way too small. I would seriously recommend you order a size, maybe even two sizes up from what your little one normally wears.."
159551,1,"My daughter found these at a major department store, the last pair they had and the clerk went to check the sizes and had one 6 and one 8 so she checked other stores and we could not get any. I came home and looked them up and they were basically the same price and they were sent to my door. Now for a dance team she needs another pair and I will just order them from here, so easy! Thanks!"
98813,0,This is a good work shoe for the weekends. I wouldn't use it necessarily for running a whole lot but more for errands and working around the house.
143214,1,"I have long, narrow feet with very little arch and I lOVE these sandals. I get a pair in June and wear them every day until the end of September; the only downside is that if you wear them every day for 4 months you wear through the bottom and have to order another pair the next season. Amazon has a much better price than REI, by the way!"
334018,1,"I had a pair of Wallabees around the age of four or five years old and to this day still remember how comfortable they were. I was looking for a pair of shoes recently, and for some reason I remembered the pair of Wallabees I had as a kid and ordered a pair of black suede Wallabees. Excellent shoe, and just as easy on my feet as I remembered they were. I was skeptical about ordering online due to the sizing but I took the advice of fellow reviewers and ordered a half size smaller than I usually do, and that did the trick. I was later able to confirm at a Clarks store near me that Wallabees do tend to be larger than one's normal size, and the ""natural toe spread"" that the shoe provides may cause your feet to slide around in the extra room unless you order a smaller size than you would usually wear. I have to say that the crepe sole is such a great concept, your feet literally spring off the ground. I liked them so much that I have since purchased an additional sand suede pair, and bought a cleaning kit from the Clarks store I went to, although they are so durable I haven't used it yet. Since then, I have also bought a pair of Wallabees for my three year old daughter, who loves them as much as I do. (Especially since we match!) As far as the look of the shoe, I have found that you either like it or you don't. My attitude is that it is a classic shoe, though some find the half moccasin/half loafer style to be ugly. To each his own! Although the Wallabee is a bit pricey, these are shoes that will last and won't fall apart like most shoes made today, and in my opinion they are worth the extra bucks. My recent interest in Wallabees has also led me to pick up a pair of the Clarks Taiga loafers, which also feature the crepe sole and are just as comfortable. Needless to say, Clarks makes a great shoe and I'm a fan."
277353,0,"Good part: it's airy, good looking, cushioning as they said, received on timeBad part: It's too tight around your foot and I would say you should consider this factor before to buy it! However, you can get a little bit comfort if you keep shoelaces loose otherwise ok"
52934,1,"I just wore these shoes to a wedding... I didn't even have time to break them in. They were the most comfortable high heels I've ever worn-- I didn't even think about them all night. (Usually, with high heels, I'm aching all night and dying to take them off...) Definitely recommend..."
221048,1,Quality shoes for the price (not made in china but Vietnam). Quiet while walking compared to standard dress-shoe leather soles.
197837,2,"I was so happy to get a pair of these shoes, until the second day I had them part of the seam ripped. Go figure with the poorly made stitching. I've never had a pear of shoes last only one day. I can't believe I wasted my money on this. I've had Wal-Mart shoes last longer than these. 365 times longer than these shoes. WTF"
381522,1,"I stand on my feet all day always looking for comfy shoes especially if they are cute,heel height perfect,could dance hrs in these,but will be wearing them to church and when I want to dress up,heel fits snug in a good way,love em,proab get another color since cute comfy shoes hard to find,yay."
308803,1,"I had tried a lot of different types of running shoes, and this one just felt the most comfortable, most supportive of all of them. For the first time my feet and ankles are not killing me after running. I really recommend it very highly. It also comes in varying widths, so people with wider feet can find the one that suits them."
182332,1,"I think my review title says it all. I bought these when pregnant with my first kiddo and they were the only shoe I wore that summer (baby born in August). I even wore them for a hot crazy day hiking all over Six Flags 2 weeks before my due date. Great in the water and out, never had a single blister. Now 3 years later I picked up a second pair. I can't say for sure, but I don't think Keen is making these any more. You can't find them at REI or other places that sell other Keens. I figured I'd grab a second pair now before they're all gone."
289424,0,"This is a funny shoe. The bottom is flat,with no arch on the outside ( the inside arch is well developed) and the toes curls up. Works well running but feels odd walking. Works well for me, a heavy runner, and has held up well. Big toe box and true to or slightly large for size."
173628,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
236669,1,"Keds Shoes are worth the money, i will buy again as long as the price does not go up, excellent"
67073,1,"My orginal order was too big, however the instructions on how to reorder and ship back so as to maintain the free shipping offer were very clear and concise. The new pair arrived very quickly and were exactly as expected."
60753,1,"I'm on my 5th or 6th pair of these boots. I'm a meat cutter. I'm on my feet, in the cold for 8 hours a day. My feet are warm, dry, and comfortable. When I wear these out, I'll buy another pair. End of story."
150232,1,"Clarks are one of the most comfortable shoes out there for me. My foot is a little wide, but the medium width works fine."
164886,1,"I love these shoes. I work in a place that has a professional dress code and I can't wear sneakers or shower type shoes. Recently my company instituted a fitness/walking program of 10,000 steps a day. The floors in my building are hard stone/granite and can be slippery when the humidity is high, so I needed a shoe with a rubber sole, looked professional and gave support and comfort... this shoe fit the ticket. The shoes are comfortable, very lightweight, well constructed and good value for my money. I would recommend them to anyone who walks or are on their feet a large percentage of the day.I'm thinking of getting another pair in an alternative color. I have seen these shoes in various mail order catalogs for about $10.00 more than from Amazon (and the vendor)."
137003,1,"Chuck Taylors are my favorite shoes. I have used them for years because they're comfortable, casual and have character. I replace them when they get too worn. I've been buying them online for a while. I found them here for under 40 bucks which was a steal. I received them in just a few days. I couldn't be happier with my new chucks."
28467,1,These shoes are comfortable as well as long lasting. They do not make your feet sweat or smell bad like other high top shoes. This shoe never goes op of style
305117,1,"This is an excellent shoe. Especially for persons with knee or foot problems. They provide additional cushioning. However, they are not cheap and their efficacy is somewhat limited as the shoes start wearing out. You'll need to replace the shoes every 1.5 years or so depending upon your usage. Otherwise I highly recommend these shoes."
79529,1,"En cuanto a calidad y precio Converse cumple con lo ofrecido, excelente calidad, durable y a la moda. Dispone para todos los gustos, edades, sin distincion, siempre innovadora"
279440,1,"The shoes arrived at the earliest date promised, just in time for their use in a break dance performance."
248230,1,"I have tried Nike, Reebok, New Balance and every other shoe with my wide foot, but nothing comes close to the 2070. Having just ordered two, that should last me a year or two and I run every day at least two miles. This shoe is the one that they should keep for a long time. Don't buy the later versions when you can stockpile these.FYI, if these are out, I reccomend the New Balance 764 which are also good, although not as good."
94080,1,"This shoe has great support and is true to size. Was a great deal considering what they are asking at a retail store. Have worn them for over two weeks and have not had any problems. Only drawback, for me, is I wish I had bought them in leather instead of suede. Great shoe"
15774,1,"Never owned a pair of Tim's before. Took them out for an all day hike and WOW! Really resistant to water, comfortable, and are durable. look forward to owning these for a few years."
373050,0,"I have really bad knees and was looking for something that offered stability and cushioning when walking. I usually buy inexpensive sneakers like DR Scholl's brand every few months, but thought I'd go for something more expensive for a change expecting it to be longer lasting and to offer more cushioning. Wrong! These were almost like walking with a wooden board tied to the bottom of my foot. They were unyielding and stiff and offered no cushioning. At first I thought it was just cuz they were new and needed to be broken in ... but after wearing them 5 days a week to work (8 - 10 hrs per day) for 2 weeks, I am seeing that they are still just as stiff and uncomfortable as the 1st day. They made my feet hurt just walking a few hundred feet and thus made my knees hurt worse than normal. They may help others with different problems but for ortho-arthritic knees, they are not a good choice! I won't buy this brand ever again."
178149,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
345410,1,"Why doesn't anybody state that they run full size large? Maybe it's not even worth mentioning as everybody knows that, but I've never had experience with Converse before. I bought those in size 10 (men's) for my brother (he always wears 10) and they are big even for my husband (who wears 11). Other than that they are OK, good quality."
319979,1,My daughter needed shoes for her dance class. I found these on amazon and I liked that they were in leather and the price even with shipping could not be beat elsewhere. I ordered the 8 1/2 and they fit perfectly. They are lightweight. Very soft leather with no break in period. Shipping was speedy just in time for her to start her class! Highly recommended to all
95641,1,"I was cautious in &quot;breaking in&quot; this shoe for fear of toe problems from another shoe brand. However, there was no problem with breaking in THIS shoe. Definitely will stick with the Ozweego Classic. Very lightweight, stylish but most of all COMFORTABLE."
123735,0,"This shoe is aesthetically superior to anything on the market, particularly the latest version, a unrivaled gem which sports a navy blue faux-suede. If you don't actually want to PLAY basketball in these, definitely get a pair.However, if you're using the shoe for its intended purpose, I hope you have narrow feet and strong ankles. As a huge fan of the original T-Macs (didn't get the T-Mac 2's because they were too narrow), I was hoping that the 3's would restore my faith in the shoe. I'm a serious baller - I play just about every day and participate in 3 corporate/city leagues.That being said, after only owning these shoes for just three few weeks, I had to return them because I sprained BOTH ankles (never happened with the T-Mac 1's) AND severely bruised my medial and plantar nerves (never happened in my life - ever). Though ankle injuries are all too common in basketball, these injuries did not occur in the typical &quot;landed on someone's foot&quot; fashion, which is cause for serious concern. I consulted my podiatrist on the issue and she informed me that my shoes provided poor support and suggested I look into a pair of New Balances.Additionally, the outside of the shoe will dig into your ankle if you lace your shoes up tightly, as there is no cushioning around the top rim of the shoe.Proceed with caution - do not be wowed by looks, particularly if you need support or have wider feet."
248372,1,i am very pleased with my purchase! i purchased these boots for my sons birthday they arrived sooner than expected in great condition! i had standard shipping and they arrived two days after i placed my order which was great so that i could complete my sons wardrobe for his birthday party! they were in good condition and authenic timberland quality!!! i would highly reccomend this seller to someone else!
178914,1,I love my chuck Taylors. They go well with Jeans or almost anything that I want to wear. Looking to buy the Chocolate next.
283957,1,"I bought this shoe in the zebra pattern; it was the correct size in a larger size. I have a friend who bought it in 8 and thought it was very big, really an 8 1/2 or even 9, but mine in 10 was perfect. I did not find it at all uncomfortable, even though it is a high heel; I thought it was very well balanced. I have to admit that when I first opened it, I was disappointed because I thought that the black dye had run into the white, but after looking more closely, I realised that was not the case, but that the shoe simply needed to be brushed (it is a 'pony hair' shoe) and once that was done, it's GORGEOUS! I am not a lovely woman but I received very nice comments when I wore it. I love these shoes!"
350653,1,I bought these for my wife and she loves me for doing so. What more can I say as an endorsement!
142584,1,Some of these items are hard to find and my wife loves to shop for this type of footware and likes what she gets thru shopping on line
383739,0,"These shoes are cute and have a more casual feel than most of my heels. When I got them in the mail I was disappointed by the width of the shoe and the over all amount of use I'm getting from them. I actually had test driven this shoe in a store (only in black) and thought I had the right size. When I got these, the shoe seemed extremely wide and I haven't used them more than once because of the color. Not a great buy on my part."
265415,1,These arrived quickly fit great and are very comfortable. I bought these for general use during colder months to replace sneakers.
224463,0,"I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)"
162151,1,My daughter was thrilled when she received this adorable shoes for Christmas. I think it was her favorite gift! They are very nice in person.
306901,1,My second pair. Convenient going through airports. More comfortable than sneakers or athletic shoes.I wear them with a sport coat or suit.
40481,1,This is a really great sandal. I have bought them in the past and have found them to be very comfortable. Not like regular flip flops. The narrow strap makes them very fashionable along with the many colors they come in. After wearing them for awhile they seem to mold to your foot shape. What I like most about them is they have a built in arch which is great for people like me who have a low arch or are flatfooted. Also the price at Amazon.com is a great buy compared to what I have payed for them in the past at other places.
249900,1,"Hi, I'm from Colombia, it is the first time that I buy in Amazon and the product that I received was in conditions excelents, I'm very excited with the product !!! Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot,Grey/Grey,7 M US"
238100,1,"These were so gorgeous I bought them in two colors... black and wine. I wear them mostly to work and I've received tons of compliments. I also wanted them in the whiskey too, but that color is $89.99, while the black and wine were $24.99. I hate that Amazon does that... has different colors and sizes at different prices. Also hate when the price changes while an item is in my cart."
7213,0,"I was pleased with the shoes, they looked good and they fit well from the first."
256239,1,Great. Loved so much ordered another color. I bought them in beige and white and just ordered the same in black.
227630,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes I've had in a very long while, and they fit like a glove! I haven't owned a pair of converse in well over 3 years, and I'm so happy I decided to buy a new pair. Will definitely keep buying from all-star for a long time to come."
177277,1,Good and quick. Love the shoes although it was a bit confusing whether it was hi top or not as it showed up differently on my order form. But it was hi-tops and I'm happy :-)
257297,0,"These sizes published are off an inch. I can get my feet in them, but the top arch makes them to tight. The extra toe length wont matter because these come to a point anyway, your feet will not be lose in them. I've been buying these shoes for over a decade, same problem with size today as a decade ago. They are very soft, and super comfortable if you get the right size, zero break in time. Very soft rubber which wears out pretty quickly on cement/pavement, but great around the yard or short chore stuff, great grip no slip. These are always sharp looking too, athletic look to em, but I would not work out in them because they do wear out quick. I buy 2 pairs at a time."
105972,1,"i am on my 2nd pair of converse monochromes and these are the only shoes i wear and will ever wear. I wear them with jeans, i wear them with black slacks, i wear them playing basketball, etc. etc. etc. They look awesome, they are super comfortable, they don't get dirty and they last about 2 years with every day wear. I threw my last pair away because i kept wearing them even though they had holes in them because i liked them so much. Pretty much if i could buy a subscription to shoes where they would send me a new pair every year I would probably do it and then just never have to worry about footwear again.Actually, this is a good idea - converse send me a pair every year please"
65296,1,"These shoes were instantly comfortable. They required no breaking in process. What a great deal. I wore Mizunos before, but love these now."
242852,1,"Just got this shoes last night and I'm wearing them this AM...they feel great. I got a total right knee replacement 7 months ago so I'm looking for comfort and support (back & hip sometimes hurt because of posture & footwear) and I'm trying different shoes etc. these are great so far good price too! Love them!!! so a week later, still love the shoe & the price was great."
270263,0,"I ordered these to for my 81 year old father to replace the very old pair he wore constantly. These were priced nicely, came quickly but really didn't look the same quality as his old pair. The looked like Rockport knock offs. If they were for me - I would have returned them but dad seems happy with the possible imitation."
301405,1,"Even though it seems a bit ridiculous buying children shoes for this kind of price, which is none-the-less, the shoes came in perfect quality and they're even more adorable than the pictures online. The delivery was quick, and the outside package was undamaged."
228742,1,"My daughter and I loved these shoes so much, she wanted a pair. She loves these more than the high top version she got previously. They are great shoe and versatile. I used to wear converse style shoes all the time when I was in high school, so it was fun to get another pair again. They fit comfortable, and felt true to size to me. Although a lot of people are saying they are not true to size. Because of that, my daughter and I bought the wrong sizes twice. So it confuses me why so many people are saying the sizing is off. So I am throwing my two cents in for that reason.My feet are about a 7 (one foot is a little longer than the other) and normal width. I'm not overweight nor extremely thin. I ordered the womens 7/ mens 5 and they feel just right. My daughter also ordered the size most closest to her foot size and she said they fit better than the other two pair we tried to over/under compensate with. Good luck!"
40880,1,"I got a pair of Ginger Reef sandals on a trip to California Adventure once upon a time. I wasn't used to sandals but in no time I had broken them in and they were so cushy and comfortable, they conformed to my feet. I wore them just about every day and they lasted me literally about 4 years. They were still wearable when I finally retired them, but they wouldn't have lasted too much longer. These sandals are the most durable articles of footwear I've ever owned, about 10 times over. They're great, though they do tend to get dirty over time... but they last."
47384,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S.

95277,1,I LOOOOOVE THEM! IVE GOTTEN SOOO MANY GREAT COMPLIMENTS ON THEM. THE PICTURE DOESNT DO THEM JUSTICE AS I DIDNT KNOW IT HAD CRYSTALS ON THE BUCKLE ALSO. PLUS THEY ARE PADDED GREAT FOR COMFORT! THANKS FOR GREAT LOOKING PAIR OF SHOES.
160428,1,"UPDATE!! Though I didn't get what I originally purchased, Extreme Footwear was wonderful in that they rushed the correct pair to me. Since they were an outside vendor Amazon couldn't ship me the correct pair they could only do the return. Extreme Footwear took the iniciative do to that for me and I am a happy customer. The shoes are exactly what we hoped for. More importantly, My son is happy!"
4011,1,"These are really good shoes. Great look. Good comfort. No break-in. Very sturdily built. Good price. True to size. The only thing is that, for me, these may not be for general wear. They don't breathe at all (since they are waterproof) and can get a little sweaty and uncomfortable if you are indoors for a while. Driving with these shoes has been a little difficult because there is less leeway for the ankle to move, or rather, it takes some getting used to. I am thinking I should have really bought the ""Low WP"" version."
236696,1,"These shoes were just as I expected. They do seem to run about a half size small, though. They do seem well made. Thanks!"
175740,1,I ordered wides and could barely get my foot in them. My foot is not that wide since I can sometimes wear shoes that are not wides. Otherwise just what I was looking for.
197682,1,"The last time I wore a pair of chucks was back in the early 80's. They are just as I remembered them. They are comfortable and easy to break in, plus my feet don't hurt after wearing them all day. Awesome shoes!! I'll be buying another pair."
84803,1,"When I was a kid in the 70s, there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out, but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards, either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings. Those sneakers were great for any sport, they held up under abuse, and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike. These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design, and come in a wide variety of cuts, colors & materials. I've got several pairs of low-cuts, one pair in suede with natural (translucent brown) rubber toe, another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber, and this pair, shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber. There are a variety of color combinations to pick from, in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile. They are some of the toughest, well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well. They're the ultimate casual weekend shoe, and the most recent ones I've gotten come with a lighter, shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert, giving better support. I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too, and honestly, the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands. They can stand up to serious abuse, especially the ones made out of leather."
21500,1,"fue una buena esperencia de haber echo negocio con ustedes y espero que sigamos haciendo negocio, el producto es bueno la talle fue exacta tonto que lo seguire comprando"
26547,0,"I bought these as character shoes for opera performance. They are very uncomfortable for now and I cannot wear them more than an hour without swearing, but all the singers I work with tell me that once you wear them for a while, they become very comfortable..."
274157,1,"My husband wears them all the time! For the price you pay, you're really getting a bargain! Genuine leather upper, casual and comfortable! My husband's only complaint is, if the color is a tad darker, they would look even better. A darker shade of brown would look much better than this particular shade of brown."
16568,1,I am satisfied with the purchase and price was unbeliavable. Thinking of ordering another pair.
256192,1,"This is my fourth pair. I bought the first pair for a trip, to facilitate the shoes-off process at security checkpoints. Liked them so much I've purchased them in three other colors. So comfortable and convenient!"
79096,1,Talk about an old reliable. Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.Converse ALL Stars are tough and have put up to the test of time.May not be the most comfortable pairs of sneakers I own. But they are great for everyday use.Highly recommend them.
272898,1,"This is my second pair of these sandals I have purchased. The first was from TJ Maxx. The ones from TJ Maxx were $20 cheaper, but I had to have another pair, and since it's winter, hard to find."
66388,1,I really enjoyed this shoe. It looks great with just about any pair of jeans I wear. The price was great and the shipping was much faster than anticipated.
190888,1,Just purchased those shoes for my brother andhe is satisfied above and beyond.A very light and comfortable feeling he told me.New Balance were and always will be the best sport shoes for me.You wan't be sorry for purchasing this particular one.5 stars !
274663,0,"I'm on my third pair of these. I wore out the first two on my daily 3-mile walk. Now, one year into these, the left boot has started to crush my left big toe as it flexes when I walk. There is still plenty of sole left but I'm afraid I can't wear these again. I have really liked this particular boot for hiking and walks but I'm afraid I'm going to have to look for something else to replace it.2013-01-23: Update. I didn't wear these for a couple of weeks and then I tried them on a 3-mile walk tonight. They were JUST FINE. My left foot must have just been sensitive for some other reason which caused the problem described above. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again when these wear out."
104164,1,"I love these shoes, I just wish that I could find them in Black. Theyare the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned."
82286,1,"very comfortable flip flops crocs, my wife is now getting more. so light and washable"
346841,1,"I ordered these shoes and received them in LESS than 24 hours. I had ordered them first from Trendi USA and after 5 days they had not even shipped them yet so I cancelled and bought these from GamedaySoles and received them the next day. So I would suggest always making sure it says, Order Fulfilled by Amazon.The shoes do run a little big so I should have ordered them a 1/2 size smaller but it's not enough to return them. Just keep that in mind before you order.Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Shoes (M9166) Low top in Black"
296289,1,ive had my yax for over 3 years now. i love these things long story short i was on a frozen pool at work and i was able to juke back and fourth like a football player and body check the other guy to the ground no problem! these are a great product theyve never broken on me but if they did it would prolly be on a hike through the mountain getting cut by the rocks but for the money its no big loss. great product work very well and give you the peace of mind to not look like a fool in front of other people when you dont slip on hidden ice
133080,1,"I bought these sandals for my daughter's birthday and they were exactly what she wanted. They fit great and I received them faster than expected. They took no time at all to ""break-in,"" not one blister. She has been wearing them every day this summer and they still look great. She loves them. I'm thinking of getting myself a pair."
114303,0,"I realize dance slippers run small, so I ordered my niece an ENTIRE size up from her normal. Still way too small. I would seriously recommend you order a size, maybe even two sizes up from what your little one normally wears.."
212294,1,"I got the shoes on the day I was promised. It is a columbia which has a very good reputation and I was not disappointed. I brought it for my son since you don't usually can find men size 7 in the store. However, you have to be sure about your shoe size or even try the actual shoes before you order your shoes online."
175110,1,"I have 6 pair of the Scout, and have had more that I have worn out! They are the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn, and I am about to purchase another pair. I am 76 years old, and have problems with balance and my back, and have had foot surgery, and the Scout keeps me moving!"
93084,1,This purchase was a replacement product and therefore a known entity. It is a good and useful summer sandal that meets a need. Ordering and shipping were on schedule and as described.
86328,1,Highly recommended.. love it. It is smooth and have the rich feel that brushes like these need to have .. Recommended for expensive shoes...
287780,2,"These boots are stylish, and I like the quick zip up action, however they aren't a good option if you intend to wear them regularly. I've had them for a little over two months and already the inside liner behind the heel has worn all the way through. Now my heel rubs directly on the hard (metal?) interior surface of the boot is giving me terrible blisters.If this is a ""once-in-a-while"" fashion option, I'd say consider it, however if you plan to walk in them regularly find something else.I'm now stuck with an expensive pair of shoes that I can't wear (after only two months) and it is past Amazon's return window. Overall a pretty negative customer experience."
55845,1,I have been wearing Keds Champion for over 65 years. It is hard to find sneakers that come in narrow widths.
236259,1,"Super comfy and light. I like the zipper sides, easy to put on and take off.Always been a fan of 5.11 products because of the quality. Shipping was fast."
10886,1,"I was cautions about buying these since they ARE made in China. Doc Martins lost all quality when they started making most of their boots in mainland China. Nonetheless, these are the most comfortable boots I've owned."
134380,1,Listened to other review and bought a size smaller (FITS Perfect) I wear size 8.5 in shoes and bought these in 7s. fits nicely with thick socks.
252390,1,I have loved crocs since my first pair last year. I ordered a khaki pair and charcoal. They are great. The delivery was fast and the price was right.
165772,1,I am on my feet teaching all day. Only Birkenstock can keep me from tiring by the end of the day.
97859,1,"This is the best product I've found for waterwear, gardenwear, casualwear. I love these corcs."
221910,1,"Best house shoe my husband has ever had. Very Comfortably Insole and keeps your feet extremely warm. Extra bonus, you can go outside and not ruin the sole of the shoe. You won't be disappointed in any way!"
313895,1,"Comfortable, warm, rugged, grippy -- everything I need for very happy feet in any kind of nonsummer weather. Wet? Who cares? Slick? Not for me!Cold? Not my feet. I especially love leaving them unlaced and slipping them on a off like loafers."
386666,1,They feel comfortable and true to size. The black and white go with everything. I'll be buying this same pair again.
46854,0,This is a generic big shoe of average manufacture and materials. It is clearly foreign but none of the cost savings of such outsourcing has been passed through to the consumer. It can be extrapolated that such behavior by the owners/managers of this company will overtime generate a market niche for an on-shore competitor to retake market share with potentially higher quality materials at the same price.
60086,1,These are very nice boots. Love the styling and appearance. They do need to be broken in a little when you first get them.
315222,0,"I got a pair of these for Xmas and was amazed that they're making these shoes again. These are very retro, Walter Payton days...Positives - the whole line of Tai Chi's are very cool looking, very retro, lots of different colors to choose from. Mine came with both white and blue laces to choose from. The cool pouch on the side of the shoes is a conversation piece.Not so positives - These aren't very comfortable shoes. They're not horrible but they're definitely not cushy like a pair of New Balance. Also they seem a little overpriced for what you're getting.So get them if you're looking to relive the '80s and only plan on wearing them every now and then."
271998,1,liked these shoes because they come in narrow so I don't have excess velcro going over the sides of the shoe. The shoes start out kind of stiff but do break in.
182269,1,"Reef sandals are the best! This style is all I've worn, and I have several pairs of them. They are sooooo comfortable! It is amazing! I have turned my friends on to them as gifts, and they love them! They are long lasting, too! They are true to size, and every color is great! I do wish they had more colors like they used to. The price is fantastic and so easy to order from Amazon."
76626,0,The other reviews said they run true to street shoe size. I disagree. They are in the general size are of street shoe sizing but run VERY narrow. If your feet are even a little bit wide these shoes are going to be a stretch for you to fit into.
209122,1,These shoes wear very well!.. Great for casual or boating. They stand up to getting wet. I have a hard time finding a shoe to fit wide feet with a high arch and instep and these shoes fit comfortably.
245984,0,"The shoe pictured is what I was expecting, but the shoe received has a shorter, flatter heel; I'll keep it, but really prefer the 1-1/4&#34; heel depicted.."
135505,1,"These shoes are great. I value a lightweight, sturdy, hightop shoe for playing basketball(prison rules style) with the 11 other firefighters I work with. They require a tough foot, but if you can hack it they will save you some money."
107491,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
124439,1,"I've gone through three pairs of these shoes in the last decade. Yes! Ten years! I'm about to turn 29 years old and got my first pair at the end of high-school from a friend. The second pair is still with me and has worn all the way through the sole but they are still comfortable and very wearable. IMHO there isn't a better casual styled shoe out there in terms of comfort, retro style and look.I will admit that I have fairly flat feet, and the slight lack of support might be part of what makes these a little more comfortable for me.In my opinion, for fifty bucks or less depending on where you buy them, getting three to four years out of a pair of shoes is simply awesome. And I don't own a bunch of shoes I wear these every day!"
279114,0,"The shoe was comfortable, but the color was very ugly. The gold was a very ugly gold color."
232224,1,"Great service. I had to return a pair I bought because they were the wrong size, and my new pair was there within 24 hours of them receiving the old ones!"
197894,1,Sneakers were a gift for son-in-law. That's the kind he likes. He's happy.
329493,0,(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
114808,1,My Mom has neuropathy in her feet and has a terrible problem with shoes. This shoe works very well for her. She wears a size 5WW which is very hard to find in shoe stores. I was able to get these on sale with Amazon's help. I couln't believe how quickly we received them... Great service....
149614,1,"If you have high or moderately high arches with a tendancy to wear down the shoes on the outside of the foot, you are like me. This shoe is pretty good for that type of foot and still provides decent to good heel support. The outside of my legs around the calves tend to cramp a little while running (less when I warm up), and while this shoe doesn't completely fix that, it helps it better than even Saucony's did. Other than Asics, Saucony, and now Mizuno, I wouldn't wear anything else.The other problem I've had for several years is heel and achilles soreness for a short time after running. This shoe comes close to eliminating that problem, but the Mizunos I've recently tried seem to have a bit more cushioning.Asics is a great product, and this shoe is a moderately priced option for underpronators like me. If that word means nothing to you, you need to research running shoes and have your own feet checked out at a running shoe store."
200819,1,I shopped everywhere for a men's size 7 for my 13 year old grandson and I was even told they didn't make it. I'm glad I tried online. These are perfect and a great price with free shipping.
380868,1,"Excellent sellet and would highley recoment, very reliable product and will definetley purchasemore items in the future. Item was being usd for walking all day at th job and this came in hancdy. I truly recoemend them.Thaks"
233161,1,"I own these shoes in about ten colors. They are well made and I search the internet to find them. Lazarus carried them but Macy's bought Lazarus, and now these shoes are no longer available locally! That's why I am buying them online."
93758,0,The stitching on heel rubbing causing blister. Good protection with weed eater. but need stitching fixed.
145964,1,Very happy with my uggs. They arrived quickly and are perfect. Comfy and great as expected. Very satisfied customer. Thanks
294541,1,"Fantastic fit and feel.. negative heal-cup = comfort.found the best deal on the net, shoesontheweb.comOverstock said they price match.. but that turned out to be bunk.I've had a pair of everything Birks, keen, .. My favorite pair was from Bass (suv series). But they were discontinued. I couldn't be happier with these. It's been a few months too and they are wearing well. I use them like slippers--mostly indoors."
112308,1,"I bought these for my niece who just started walking and she wears them every day. Now they are going to buy her some other colors! She had tried putting keds on her, but they were way too clunky and heavy and she was tripping all the time, but these are literally like walking bare foot for them and very supportive! A must have for a new walker!"
328056,1,"I bought these shoes just before embarking on a two month trip to Maui, and they worked out beautifully.First of all, the most amazing thing about these sandals is the sole. There really is a lot of traction to be had here, as you can see in the picture. I used these to hike two miles up and two miles down a VERY steep and VERY muddy trail in the rain on Maui, and they offered amazing traction over slippery rocks, grass, and mud in these adverse conditions. I used them on several other less demanding hikes, but I found them to be very trustworthy on all trials. The only downside is that they should probably be worn with socks in these situations if possible, to prevent blisters. Other than that, they are pretty comfortable.I am a huge proponent of breathable, natural materials, and these sandals are exactly the reason why. They are not made from the best materials, as other reviewers have stated, and this impedes breathe-ability and temperature control. You may find your feet sweating and sliding around on the leather-like material the in-sole is made of.All in all, I was very impressed with this as my first Skechers shoe. They were very durable, standing up to two months in water, mud, sand, hiking, walking, even salt water! I will probably buy another Skechers product just because of this sandal."
91881,1,"I was silly, and didn't listen to the reviews about this shoe running large. I always wear size 11, and that's what I ordered. Of course, the shoe was too large, and for the first time ever I had to return shoes that I purchased online. Fortunately, Footwear Headquarters knows what it takes to make happy customers, and they did everything they could to help the exchange process. They were quick to reply, super friendly, and seemed to actually care about their customers. I love that. Oh, and the shoes look and feel amazing."
163750,1,"These shoes are well-made, comfortable, and just a little edgy. I bought them in fawn and the color is conservative enough to wear in the office. A half-size down fits me perfectly. Very happy. Might get them in black, too."
121667,1,"These were a specific request from a son & I would think that a compliment in itself! I suggested getting a pair of shoes when I saw the ones he was wearing after he got home from work. He said, &#34;I am not getting any til I can afford the ones that are comfortable & that I want&#34;"
315007,0,"I just received my ""navy""/black shoes. They are not the navy shown in the picture. The color is almost exactly the same as the blue in the blue/orange shoe.I haven't decided if I will keep the shoes or not. Shipping was quite fast."
226994,0,"Bought this for my cousin, he said it an big about half to a whole size. He's an 8.5 and i bought him the 8.5 and its big on him but he was fine with it since he wears thick socks anyway. The color black was really nice and the design as well. As for the quality, can't speak for it right now since we just got it but so far upon close inspection when i got the shoes, it look durable and made well so hopefully it'll last long."
1852,1,"I'm really, really happy with these boots. An awesome price for a super-sturdy piece of footwear that seems like it's going to last a really long time. I needed footwear that would support my ankles, for both every day walking and hitting the hills with my dogs. These fit the bill.Why buy a second pair?Two reasons:1) I'm paranoid the price will go up.2) These are nice enough to wear out into the real world, and I didn't want to have to worry about keeping my daily pair ""nice"".The biggest problem for me? They do require some breaking in and for me, it was kind of a painful process. They are rigid, strong boots, and they do give way eventually. Already, after only a few months, my first pair are taking on that nice patina that well-worn leather boots get.It makes me said that I'll have to go through that process again with my second pair, which will take longer because they will be worn less frequently."
247050,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
44531,1,"When it comes to appearance, this shoe is as plain as you can get. Black leather uppers, black shoestrings, black sole, etc. However, they are also very attractive and looks rather smart when paired with dark colored jeans.This is a high quality leather shoe. The waterproof leather used in the uppers are very supple. The substantial sole is sturdy, but like the uppers, very supple. The orange lining on the inside is high quality, and presents an interesting contrast to the exterior of the shoe. This shoe also has Timberland's Smart Comfort technology. My pair did not require any break in period. They were comfortable from the start.There are plenty of black, waterproof oxfords out there. I had a tough time deciding between these Timberlands and a pair of Rockports. They both shared the same aesthetic style and waterproof characteristics. The Rockports had a slightly square shaped toe, as opposed to this one's rounded shape. I chose the Timberlands because I already had the same pair of Rockports in brown.I can readily recommend this Timberland model to anyone who is looking for a pair of black oxfords. They can be worn casually, with jeans. Or you can also wear them at the office with dark colored chinos. If you prefer, you can apply a little wax for added shine."
296472,1,"Love this diaper bag, so cute, exactly what I wanted! Great size love that it is laminated and you can just wipe off! I would definitely recommend."
127332,1,5 star all the way love vans. No abnormalitys to the show shipped fast great seller. No problems with product works great if you have wide feet as well.
284493,0,I rated this shoe as average because the materials used are plastic feeling and very light weight. I purchased this same shoe many years ago and was impressed with the quality materials but this latest shoe is not of the same quality. Time will tell if it is as durable as my old pair. I would probably not recommend this shoe to a friend
31428,1,"Crocs are really a classic shoe. We bought this pair for our daughter, as she has outgrown her last few pair. We wear them to the pool, when we just need to run outside for a minute, when we take our dog outside... and I don't know if this is recommended or not, but frozen crocs feel wonderful on sore feet!"
179718,1,I got these shows and began to wear them right off to break them in. I have to say if you stand for a long period of time dont wear them. If you are weight lifting with them then they work great. They have no real arch support because they were originally made back in the day before they had arch support. But great shoes!!
106046,1,"You can never go wrong with SAS shoes. The delivery of the shoes was great and in a timely fashion, I'm sure I will order again, and the prices can't be beat!"
181100,1,An Excelent choice. Good quality for accesible price. Perfect for everyday use. I am very satisfied and I recommend it.
206569,1,These are my favorite kind of sneaker to wear. They came to me un blemished and promptly. The shoes are comfortable and long lasting.
277904,1,"the fit is good, are truly waterproof right out of the box, no break in period"
266297,1,"Over the years I've typically bought much higher end hiking boots but was tired of spending over $200 and wanted to find something comparable at a lower price point. These were recommended to me by a friend and after reading the reviews I decided to give them a try. I was not disappointed. I have taken them out a few times for both long (12-14 hour) and short (4-6 hour)hikes after breaking them in around the house for a couple of weeks. As a geologist I've also worn them to do field work a number of times and they have held up to climbing, hiking and all manner of abuse while doing field work. They are extremely comfortable on my foot and ankle, have given me no blisters and are light enough not to tire you out after a long morning of trekking through whatever it is you want to trek through. I didn't find my feet getting hot or developing hot spots and in the end, forgot about my feet altogether (Which is a first). They are waterproof as promised and heavy dew, shallow streams/mud puddles won't even phase them as my feet stayed dry all day long. The only test remains to be how well they stand up over time. I inspect my boots after every use and so far, they don't appear to have any weak spots at all. I highly recommend these boots for medium to light duty hiking or work scenarios."
272974,1,"I bought this pair of FiveTens with intention to use for higher grade trad climbing that would require to sustain lots of edging, rock smearing and comfort for multi-pitch routes. I must report that it fulfilled all my demands through adequate testing. I even took them bouldering to see how they would hold and was impressed by the stickiness and control the rubber provides. Even though I have a pair of more aggressive La Sportiva for that, these ""Spires"" could be used to certain degree as well. The heel is very sturdy and sticky and held very well on all heel hooks I tried. I bought one size less than my street shoe and it gave my feet a perfect ""soap dish"" feel while giving plenty of adjustments for customized shape with lace-up tops. I'm very satisfied with these."
55641,1,"I love to wear my keds. The price, the quality and having them available was why I chose them,Its had to find keds this time of year. I really want a pair of leather keds with the same style and size, just leather not canvas material. Thanks again and hope I will hear from you soon when these can be found."
223405,1,"The 990 Serries New Balance are some of the best shoes availible. After standing on concrete floor for 8 to 10 hours per day, I found other brands looked great, but were uncomfortable after 3 or 4 months. The New Balance shoes lasted twice as long and cost about the same price as the Nike and other brands I had previously purchased. I've bought nothing but New Balance ever since - for over 10 years now. Beside the durablity and the correct size avalibility, I find wearing shoes made in the USA rather than Korea or China a major plus!"
192843,1,"I have always liked Naturalizer shoes and had some similar to the Scout in the past. I like the fact that I can adjust their tightness by moving the tab at the closing. My only difficulty is that, as yet, they are a bit stiff. However, I expect them to become more supple after wearing them for some time.Nancy Holt"
62594,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
222082,0,"The loafers didn't fit but I don't think I would have kept them even if they did. I was not happy with the quality of the leather. It cost almost $10 out of pocket to send them back, and this was the cheapest way to ship."
116129,1,"Got these for my daughter for Christmas. The leather is nice and supple, they fit well, and adjust easily. Don't yet know how well they'll hold up, but I think they'll still be in great condition after she outgrows them."
186100,1,"I love Puma shoes--especially the Future Cat Low. Puma is by far the best quality sneaker I've ever had. The price of their shoes is a bit more than the average, but you get what you pay for. They are great-looking and are extremely comfortable. I am so pleased with these shoes that I plan on only purchasing sneakers from Puma from now on. I've bought four different Future Cats: dark shadow/persimmon orange, black/white/Chinese red, white/black/vapour blue, and black coffee/white/burnt olive."
81084,1,"Likem' alot! Fit was better than others I have gotten form Reef in the past. I'm keepen'them no matter what my granddaughter says! (and, no, I am NOT too old to wear them !) They are nice and soft and I particulary like the footbed. It sort of cradles you foot."
180316,1,The Converse All-Star is a great looking shoe. The only problem is that they run big in size. Ex. If you wear a men's 10 1/2 you probably should order a 9 1/2 or 10. Otherwise you might feel like you're wearing clown shoes.
325853,1,"These mocs are comfy and sturdy enough to wear to work every day -- I work retail, so I'm on my feet for about 7-8 hours a day. I have to wear arch-support inserts with them, but I do that with every shoe I own. I would buy these mocs again."
184815,1,"I love Reef and I love these flaps!Everyone knows Reef makes the best flaps (right??), and in my opinion the Ginger is the best of the best. Basic, timeless style and full of Reef's great support from the ball of your foot through the arch through the heel. I hope they make these forever!"
263555,1,I am happy with This Purchase Order.I am fanatic of Retro Adidas Brand(originalls).It was a gift to my son of 14 year of ageHe was very happy and share with me a liking for the adidas brand.In Ecuador is very difficult find Adidas Originall
388300,1,"i never ever do without my corcorans. when one pair is wearing out, i buy another. it is the single best boot. i wear them every day, and they contour to your foot. they last a loooooooonnnggg time, and i work on my feet (i'm a waitress). i never have foot pain/issues in my corcorans. i was a chef for years and wore my corcoran jumpies. i beat the living xxx out of them, and they lasted for years in that kitchen with all of the grease/heat/constant running.im almost teary-eyed, thinking of how my corcorans have served me. ive been wearing them since i was 15. i will never be without a pair!"
231337,1,"I tried to find these boots at my local retailers to verify the correct size. None of the stores had them. So, good old Amazon once again offered the best selection and price. I bought 1/2 size larger than my normal shoe to allow for thick socks. These boots fit just fine and are amazingly cozy and warm. I spent over 3 hours out in the snow yesterday and my feet weren't cold at all. More snow today and I can't wait to get out in it, knowing my feet will be dry and warm. I love these boots!"
45923,1,"I wanted some new summer sandals, but I didn't want to pay top dollar.I first looked at Clarks, but no good prices on what I liked.I looked at several other brands before seeing Propet. I decided to give them a try, and I am so thankful I did!The propet women's breeze walker sandal is well made, expensive looking and very comfortable. No break in time needed.This particular sandal has some type of breathable cushiony thing which seems to keep my feet dry so far. (we'll see how well it work as weather gets much hotter).If you're on the fence about buying these or another brand (like Clark's), I'd say give Propet a try. The quality and comfort are there.Hopefully, you'll get them on sale!"
113925,2,"I normally wear an 11 1/2 in 574s but had to return the 420s for an 11. They run large, which is strange for being from the same company. They are super thin, light, and only stay comfortable for about a half hour. Afterwards your feet WILL hurt. I don't recommend them, even though they look cool. Comfort is a must, so I will be going back to my beloved 574's."
71093,1,"These shoes were too big for a woman size 10 feet. So I sold it on Ebay, but they were a nice bright color."
16922,1,"My husband started playing soccer on Saturdays with some friends and he didn't have any soccer cleats so he used his old football cleats for months. I decided to look into soccer cleats and found these Adidas Copa Mundial's. They were at a decent price, carried half sizes and had a few good reviews. I took a chance; and when my husband tried them on, he absolutely loved them. And, of course, they were so much lighter than his football cleats. They fit him perfectly, they look great on him, and he says that they feel great.Thank you!"
355921,1,"The shoes seem pretty nice. I like the style, but the comfort is the real reason I'm giving a high rating. I have strangely shaped feet, and the shoes adapted in just a few miles."
129122,1,"Propet Women's Breeze Walker SandalI have n't bought many shoes on line, but I actually had tried on this model while shopping a few weeks earlier. However I couldn't imagine how luxuriously comfortable it would be. I am wearing it everywhere - church, work, shopping - it's that comfortable. They are also very lightweight and easily wiped off. And they were ten dollars cheaper than at the ""outlet"" store where I was shopping. What a bargain."
311931,1,"I LOVE my Moccasins! They are so Cute and Comfortable, i want to buy another pair in blue =]The only thing is that i am unsure as to whether these are for indoor or outdoor use, because it doesn't have a floor sole."
335345,0,Revisited a product I have liked before. After first wearing the leather finish was flimsier and scratched off with absolutely minimal abuse. Price held steady over time but the quality suffered.Still comfortable and true to size.
38065,0,Sent it back because it made my feet look even bigger. Did not fit well either. The support was comfortable but did not like the look on me.
56413,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
248676,1,"speedy shipping, package arrived before estimated time of delivery.gladly do business with seller again any day of the week."
254435,1,We ordered these in every size as our children grew. Absolute must have for the summer. Great buy and fit!
381196,1,"Great AUD price against the USD, product priced over here at $129 locally so a great saving for us and as have purchased Adidas previously knew the product was good quality and the service received from Amazon was fast and every efficent. Would use again for sure."
14437,1,I bought this shoe for my nephew and he has been loving it since. He plays pretty good soccer and with these shoes he's more comfortable on the field and even scores every game. Thanks amazon....
194282,1,These are just as expected and we were glad we ordered a larger size as other customers had suggested. These are great quality.
32014,1,"This item was intended for my Mom on Mother's Day, it arrived in time and the product was of excellent quality. The Crocs this seller has are the ones made in Canada, not the bad quality Taiwan made ones.Thank you for helping in making my Mom happy."
284435,1,I absolutely love Birkenstocks. I have a lot of problems with my feet & with my job have to be on them a lot. Birkenstocks are the first thing I put on when I get home. So comfortable & my feet feel amazing after a short time. Highly recommend these for anyone with any type of foot problem.
264148,1,"I love them! I wear them almost everyday, with jeans, athletic wear, or a casual skirt. As a stay at home mom, I look for items that are stylish and functional. Love it!"
93681,1,The shoes are comfortable. Easy to wear and feel great with or without socks!
86970,1,"The purchase took place as expected in estimasdo time, and with respect to the product announcement being sold agrees with what is expected without any complications or problems arise"
67334,1,"I have worn out one pair of these boots and am now on a new pair. I love that they are tough, warm, and comfy. They continue to look good for a long time. I wear them to work in the winter months with dress pants. I get compliments about them a lot. If you want warmth and duribility - here's your boots."
213221,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
192682,2,"The last Naturalizer Navy Women's Scout sandals I bought were well made. These had cheaper quality leather, thinner soles, and no elastic in the back of the heel, which I need for my narrow heels. I was disappointed. Especially, since I paid $18.00's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before."
115498,1,"I buy it for a gift and the person who reseved it is very happy, they was in time and very good packing."
241754,1,I first purchased these shoes quite some time ago and I am sorry that I did not purchase a second pair while they were still available. The shoe is one of the most comfortable pair of shoes that I have ever had. There was no break in period they were comfortable right from the start. I have troubled feet and I also have had many surgeries on my left foot but I can wear these shoes all day long without a problem! They were expensive but they were worth every penny and more. Now I am looking for styles from New Balance that are very similar to these! The shoes run about 1/2 size smaller so purchase the next size up to give yourself enough room for orthotics and thicker socks.
139770,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
174629,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
104477,1,"This was the second time we ordered Pink Converse Shoes for my daughter, the first time I didn't get the size right. I returned them to ""Shoes R Us"" I think it was called and they took care of my mistake very quickly. Unfortunately they didn't have the size I needed so I ordered a replacement pair from Last Pairs. They came quickly, fit perfectly and were reasonably priced, the same as our local mall, without the hassle! Very good experience overall, would recommend."
289107,1,"With the proper sizing of my foot by a podiatrist, I then logged on to Amazon, knowing I wouldn't be disappointed! My New Balance size 13 D shoes arrived well within my expectations.I knew I could count on Amazon!A very satisfied customer!"
25947,1,"If you are an avid runner that appreciates comfortable shoes, then buy these shoes. The 991 is the only shoe that I have purchased more than once. I have tried many others and these are my favorite."
205081,0,"I wanted to love these boots. They fit my narrow, low volume/high arch/instep really well. But after a couple hours of hiking, the edge of the tongue, which creates a firm ridge, starts to bruise my leg just above my ankle bone. Maybe it isn't soft and padded enough. I have very narrow ankles/legs and tie the upper portion of the boot snugly so it won't slip and maybe it pushes the tongue into my leg too much. I tried lacing them with the tongue on the outside but it wouldn't stay that way very well and wasn't real comfortable. It felt sorta like having shin splints by the end of the day. I'm so bummed cuz I think these could have finally been the ones!"
193912,1,I order these shoes at least twice a year as my son's school requires these shoes as part of their dress code. I have never been disappointed!
34311,1,lasted through 4 years of high school wrestling and I've got no complaints. They're still in one piece which is more than I can say for the 2 backpacks I went through. Can't ask for anything more than that.
165705,1,"I purchased these as a modified hiker, you know when a hiker is just a bit much. These are sturdy, comfy, would work well as either the sports or the hiker type of shoe. Fit seemed true."
109879,1,"I love these shoes and have been wearing them since I was a teenager, I'm now in my early thirties. The comfort hasn't changed- it's like walking barefoot almost. It feels so natural to walk in these, but they're a lot more polished-looking than flip-flops or clunky sandals. I can wear these to work, out to dinner, out to clubs, to the pool and more and I'm always comfortable and look stylish. There are lots of colors to choose from, even in my 11W size. I have flat feet and they are still comfy all day at the end of the day. The price is good, too.On a side note, my mother has severe diabetic neuropathy of the feet and lower legs, and these are the ONLY shoes she can wear- not WANT to wear (though she loves them), but literally, she HAS to wear them. They're that comfortable for her."
21125,1,"I wear a half-size smaller because these shoes come in wide sizes (i.e they fit)! I'm curious to see how long they will last as they are guaranteed for 1000 miles. Very attractive and comfortable, and reasonably priced. I recommend the quick-adjust velcro for anyone who walks before or after work, or at lunch, or who takes shoes on & off throughout the day."
161244,1,"I gave this snikers to my 15 year-old son and he loved. It has a juvenile color and it can use it daily, are confortables, the color is durable. Their friends have liked it. I recommend it"
153052,1,"............ Purchase these boots, super comfortable and exceptionally warm! If you cannot stand warm feet, don't buy this.Otherwise, if you want warm feet, do purchase these!Solid Timberland product!"
320828,1,"These shoes fit true to size. They are just as pictured, you will not be disappointed."
58262,2,"I ordered these Navy Keds tennis shoes for my daughter. The color shows navy, but when they arrived they looked black...the box said navy! Had to return because of the shade."
280586,1,"I normally wear a 10.5 shoe and I ordered this item in a 10.5. The shoe is definitely a little big. I should have ordered a 10.The shoe looks great, I've received a few compliments on it. The leather has a ""smooth"" surface - I'm sure there's a name for this.All in all, it's a good looking shoe with style."
183179,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
208133,1,"Well, ten dollar shoes. Great price. I love how everyone is complaining about how they are 1 size smaller than what they say.Actually you're WRONG. Asics is a company based in Kobe. If you looked at the seller's size charts, you would have clearly seen the international size chart.So it was more of your error for not selecting the correct size. So please, don't complain about the Flat. These reviews are about the QUALITY of the item...not about how it wasn't what you ordered. They gave you exactly what you wanted.So people, look at the size chart. &lt;3"
108427,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
56281,1,"I loved absolutely everything about my pair of Keds - excellent throwback to my elementary school years - however, they were a tish too narrow for my big flippers so they had to be returned unfortunately.The yellow laces definitely gave the graphite color a pop that made the Keds cute and fun. I might hafta order this in a wider size... :D"
112,1,So far these hikers have performed well. I have a pair of low cut Hi Tec hikers as well and bought these for winter use. I've worn the low cuts hikers for several years and they have held up very well. I expect these new hikers will do the same.
373841,1,I have a pair of these and love them they are very comfortable and built to last my wife had me order her a pair in her size and she loves them this is my second pair of merrels i wont wear anything else and they are less money on amazon than in the store way to go amazon
254427,1,i recommend these shoe to everyone because them fit so good on my baby's little feet not like other these shoe's are so comforable my baby can wear them all day and not want them off
57464,1,"Searched local stores, this shoe and no where to be found. Ordered on Amazon, and it is exactly what I wanted. I am extremely pleased."
356058,0,"I ordered a 40, what was supposed to be a women's size 9, but these were way too big. At least 2 sizes. I found a store that sold these and ended up with a size 38. I was told by someone else they had the same problem. Now that I know my correct size I would have no problem buying these again."
217325,1,"The shoes fit my husband true to size, the actual color is darker than it looks and we like the actual color more than the picture."
86120,1,"I supinate terribly and tend to have terrible ankle problems because of it. After college it got to the point where I was destroying a pair of sneakers every 4-6 months (I would have to replace them because I would have shooting pain from my ankles to my lower back). I'm a microbiologist, so I spend almost all of my workday on my feet on a hard floor (usually concrete + linoleum). I finally sucked it up and shelled out the money for a pair of Danskos. It has been two years, and they're still in good shape. I haven't been good about keeping them polished, so the finish is starting to get ratty, but they're still very comfortable. I've gotten to be pretty dependent on them, as my ankles often complain if I go more than three or four days in any other pair of shoes.They have dyed my socks on occasion, particularly in wet weather, but I would consider it a very small price to pay for the comfort.Needless to say, I'm far more likely to invest in a pair of Danskos than any other shoe."
128013,0,"I bought these for a four-week vacation in which these were the only shoes I could use as I travel very light. I bought the sandals because they looked well ventilated, they are waterproof and based on the price should be well constructed.Pros: The foot bed conforms to your feet over a periodThey are very comfortable even when walking for several miles over uneven surfaces.They are well constructed and show no wear after walking 300+ miles.Cons: The toe cap will make your toes sweatThey dry very slowly and should not be considered if you are in and out of water... unless you are ok with your feet being wet for 4+ hours.They hold on to odor. After 4 or 5 days, I needed to wash the shoes every evening due to the smell (and they were never fully dry in morning after 8+hours of drying). I have owned Birkenstocks, Tevas and other sandals and never had the same level of issues with odor.These are ok sandals but I wouldn't buy them again."
330384,0,"I got this on sale for a really good price. I have always been a fan of Adidas shoes but I thought I gave Converse a try for the good price. Currently, I also wear Adidas Team MAC 2, which I bought for a few dollars more than the Converse. The Team MAC 2 defnitely has much better feel and support, especially when landing after a jump. I have worn Nike, Reebok and other brands of basketball shoes of about the same price and the support provided by the Converse is only average. For example, the tongue of the Converse is thin while the Adidas is breathable mesh and much thicker. I feel like I am wearing a cheap, store brand basketball shoes with the Converse. Don't let the ICON system fool you, it doesn't do anything special and is no comparison to Adidas's AdiPRENE+, Torsion System and A3 Structure. In my opinion, Adidas has the best fit, feel and support for about the same price. I currently own 4 pairs of basketball shoes and one pair of running shoes. All are Adidas with A3 or AdiPRENE+. All are remarkably comfortable. I know, but they were all on sale for very low prices. So I stocked up."
150207,1,"I'm so glad that I discovered these shoes! I have them in every color and wear them most of the time. I travel a lot and I can walk all day in these shoes without pain. I especially like the idea of the velcro straps everywhere so that if your feet swell from sitting too long, you can let them loose a little while. They don't take up lots of room in your luggage. You can be dressed up or dressed down. I've worn them to the beach and also for evening wear with a long skirt. Treat yourself and buy a pair of these wonderful shoes! Order your regular size as they are true to fit. Ignore the person who compared these to Clark's. These are better."
138837,1,"I ordered my Keds here because they were available in the size AND color I wanted - which never happens elsewhere. It's hard to find shoes I like that fit my feet because I wear a smallish size and have really deep insteps. But here, I was able to get exactly what I needed - 7 extra wide, red. I'm rocking them with all my favorite outfits and I will definitely be back when I want more."
323091,1,"These look pretty good, but they're really delicate. Also, they don't look that good with shorts, but with pants, they're awesome. Surprisingly, the white leather part stays white, and is really hard to stain, as opposed to the white part surrounding the bottom of the shoe."
93313,1,I have very flat feet and no arch in my feet (shoe store lady told me she never seen such flat feet in her entire life) She recommended the Gel Kayno Shoes and they have been really Great! So good in Fact that I decided to only wear Gel Kayno shoes...My first pair cost me $139.00 and a year and some months later I decided I like them so much that I brought the exact same pair for $79.00. (i wear these shoes with arch support insules from finish line and really i have not found a better more comfortable shoe)
124884,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
102480,1,Nice wides sizes and very comfortable. Looks nice and feels good.Good bargain online. Will buy again when these wear out.
91548,1,Beautiful and comfortable dancewear. I got compliments the first time I wore them. I may just have to buy a pair in a different color.
192128,1,"Such a great sandal, especially for my boys. Waterproof, upholds to dirt and grime, easy to wash. Would recommend for any age."
85695,1,my daughter loves these crocs the price was great and the shipping super fast thanks
177352,1,I am in my upper 40's and shoe comfort is a must. I paired my Chucks with a pair of Sof Sole insoles and they are soooo comfy. I have not tried to run in them or walk a marathon. Not sure I want to take that risk. I boughy my insoles from Sports Authority for $15. They are the gel ones that are super thin.
237390,1,"My son was thrilled to find these Tims at this unbelievably low price. Amazon shipping was prompt as always, and the fit was perfect."
129664,1,I was soooo tickled pink with my pink Nellie Chukka boots. I saw them on the web page and I had to have them. Pink is my favorite color. They are extremely well made. They didn't need breaking in either. That is a major plus. They fit perfectly. Also they arrived in record time except it was like waiting for Christmas. I love them so much it is all I can do not to wear them to bed. :-) I want several more pairs. I am waiting for them to be available in red leather.
51359,0,"I have really bad knees and was looking for something that offered stability and cushioning when walking. I usually buy inexpensive sneakers like DR Scholl's brand every few months, but thought I'd go for something more expensive for a change expecting it to be longer lasting and to offer more cushioning. Wrong! These were almost like walking with a wooden board tied to the bottom of my foot. They were unyielding and stiff and offered no cushioning. At first I thought it was just cuz they were new and needed to be broken in ... but after wearing them 5 days a week to work (8 - 10 hrs per day) for 2 weeks, I am seeing that they are still just as stiff and uncomfortable as the 1st day. They made my feet hurt just walking a few hundred feet and thus made my knees hurt worse than normal. They may help others with different problems but for ortho-arthritic knees, they are not a good choice! I won't buy this brand ever again."
15142,1,"These are my favorite shoes! I wear them all day, and forget I have them on, except I notice my back feels better than usual. I can stand on my feet for long periods of time without having fatigue in my legs or back. The sole is flexible and light, my toes have plenty of room in front, yet they don't slip off my heels, and they are easy to put on and take off. Awesome shoe!"
345296,1,"Got these for our 15 year old son. He wears them with a pair of dark rinse skinny levi jeans, leather studded punk belt and a tee. Gotta have these shoes to get that ""rocker"" look. Only con about the shoe is that within a couple of weeks, one of the metal eyelets(for ventilation) on the side of the shoe fell off. However, the insole is thicker and cushiony compared to other cheaper knockoffs, like at Walmart. Anyhow, our son loves them and would give a 5 star rating, but I gave a 4 star rating for quality."
324729,1,"Not only are the the Puma Anjan trendy and hot but they are also the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn. I bought my first pair last summer, as I work long shifts on my feet and these shoes are excellent for that. They are thin and have breathable mesh, I very much recommend you go out and buy them."
280480,1,"Finally replaced my Canadian knockoffs with the real thing - Sorel! Seller was great and when I realized the size 10s that I bought were too small they agreed to exchange - no questions asked. BUT here'sa trick...The size 10 Sorel boot shell turned out to be the right size for me. It was the size 10 liner that was tight, so I took the size 11 liners from my knockoffs (WHICH I HAD REPLACED WITH SOREL LINERS) and viola! Perfect fit all around."
32372,1,I have very flat feet and no arch in my feet (shoe store lady told me she never seen such flat feet in her entire life) She recommended the Gel Kayno Shoes and they have been really Great!

182011,1,"Great pair of boots. They are true to size with ample room in the toe box. They are comfy right out the box, I am waiting for some snow in NY so that I can see how well they keep my feet warm."
218428,1,"I love these shoes - they're classic, versatile and comfortable. They wear into the shape of your foot and become like a favorite pair of jeans - worn in all the right places, fitted to your form and reliable. I have two pairs of these and I just bought another pair for my boyfriend (who is now hooked)."
81432,1,These shoes are a great throw back to when I was a teenager. My daughters love them. They look super cute with any outfit - it doesn't have t be athletic
367543,0,They are a basic tan mocassin. I bought them to wear while walking the dog. They are okay for that.
322718,1,"These ballet slippers are well made. I wear these for stretches and some yoga. Please remember to check the Capezio online size chart before you order (your regular shoe size VS the slipper size will vary), as the size I ordered was a little large. However the ties are also draw strings so I was able to cince up to a perfect fit. I recommend these slippers for their sturdy construction and price."
359763,1,"The price is a lot lower than what I can find locally given the qualities are similar as far as I can tell. I bought them for my ballroom dance class according to recommendation from teacher.I usually wear size 6.5 or 7, this is for juniors and I read some of the reviews prior to ordering so I ordered a size 8, however it turned out to be a little big, no major problem dancing in them since the belts secure them well on my feet and these are comfy shoes. I didn't want to bother exchanging for maybe half a size smaller cuz I didn't know whether 7.5 would be too small or not, and that my class has begun.Just a piece of advise on those who are pondering on what size to buy."
171418,1,"Great everyday shoe. You can wear all day ! Comfortable yet stylish , feels like walking on air. You can't beat the price too !"
58144,0,Unfortunately these run a bit tight. Length is fine but width is actually tight. I wish I could fix this issue but I really do not want to have to send these back...
300837,1,"I have owned this boot for several years and got my husband a pair a couple of years ago. We have done everything from cleaning kennels, barnwork, shoveling snow, hiking, and general run-around and they hold up and perform amazingly. Boots are water resistant, not waterproof, so a good boot oil is helpful. The boot is worth an easy 5 stars, but I found this exact boot locally for $20 cheaper so you may want to check your local stores before ordering..."
264156,1,"Great Western style boot. All leather, well and solidly made. Rubber soles are good in almost any weather. These boots are a better fit for narrow or regular feet and will not fit a wide foot."
103671,0,"I've used this style of shoe for over 20 years and I've tried several newer versions. Most of them last longer than the soles of the Pro classic, but they never feel as comfortable right out of the box. Even though they only last me about 2 months I'm sticking with them."
293661,0,The boots were poor quality. I was confused when I purchased the item. I did not realize that the product was from England until the total purchase price was given. It did not say where the item came from and I did not understand the sign that made it pounds. It was a huge mistake that could have been prevented if the place the item is from would be shown clearly. I have returned the items. I will let you know how well this part is handled.
157789,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
525,1,These boots are extremely comfortable and very waterproof. I use them for powerwasher and stay dry and comfortable even though I am on my feet for many hours.
302107,0,"These are some of the nicest looking shoes I have seen all season, but they are agony to wear. Probably the most uncomfortable shoes in my closet."
210695,2,"I have very wide feet and was thrilled to find a nice-looking pair of mocs in a 4E size for women. I ordered them, waited anxiously, tore open the box when they arrives and...The 4E (which was labeled on the shoes themselves, so it wasn't a mistake in size) was NOT wide AT ALL. They were narrower, in fact, than my mother's medium width shoes. This is NOT an industry standard 4E... nowhere close to it.Very disappointed."
239640,1,"The &#34;Khaki&#34; is actually green. An actual better color in my opinion. It looks a little dorky out of the box, but after the break in, it looks a lot better with a distinct FiveTen look.Again, the &#34;Khaki&#34; is actually green and it's a great color."
61065,1,I'm have never been disappointed with a Hi-Tech shoe. The Altitude is a fantastic boot and nicely priced. My last pair lasted four year and I just bought another. Better waterproofing than my gore-tech hikers. I try other hikers but I keep coming back to Hi-Tec.

220114,1,Comfortable!Love it! Looks great with skinny jeans. DIdn't know it came with white laces so I bought it beforehand.. oh wells. Love it! looks so clean and cute.
139039,1,"shoes are very light, comfortable and good price from amazon. just the look is not as nice as otehr shoes i like , but for the use purpose, thay are great."
126663,1,they do a really good job; fast shipping and the item was in very good condition i give them 6 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!
288766,1,The shoe is of good quality and fit.. Very comfortable fron first step.. Would purchase again...Timberland Men's Kiawah Bay 2 Boat Shoe
330108,0,"I got this on sale for a really good price. I have always been a fan of Adidas shoes but I thought I gave Converse a try for the good price. Currently, I also wear Adidas Team MAC 2, which I bought for a few dollars more than the Converse. The Team MAC 2 defnitely has much better feel and support, especially when landing after a jump. I have worn Nike, Reebok and other brands of basketball shoes of about the same price and the support provided by the Converse is only average. For example, the tongue of the Converse is thin while the Adidas is breathable mesh and much thicker. I feel like I am wearing a cheap, store brand basketball shoes with the Converse. Don't let the ICON system fool you, it doesn't do anything special and is no comparison to Adidas's AdiPRENE+, Torsion System and A3 Structure. In my opinion, Adidas has the best fit, feel and support for about the same price. I currently own 4 pairs of basketball shoes and one pair of running shoes. All are Adidas with A3 or AdiPRENE+. All are remarkably comfortable. I know, but they were all on sale for very low prices. So I stocked up."
82315,1,i absolutly LOVE these booties! very stylish and sleek. very light weight. i really like the suede look as well. I would love to have them in every color!!
32169,1,"I love this wrist-let. I have a larger frame and the wide strap is really comfortable and flattering as well. Highly recommend this to anyone of any age, goes from casual to more dressy. I got it in the black and it is good quality leather- not too shiny."
162756,1,"The product was the perfect color, soft leather and a nice heel height. My only problem was that it fit me too tight across the toes. I was sad to return it since it was being sold at such a great price but I have wide feet and would not be able to deal with that tiny problem after 4 hours in those pumps. Great shoe overall."
186889,1,"This is a quality lightweight shoe. I think you'd have a hard time finding a shoe of this type, as well made, at any price range. Very comfortable, very stylish."
246293,1,I ordered a blue 9. (one size bigger) It's WARM AND COMFY. Exact the height that I want. But I found out that the chestnut in 9 is back to stock again. So I am wondering if I need a change. Let me try their customer service:)
51765,1,"This is the second pair of Aetrex walkers of this particular type I have purchased because they support my feet, never cramp them, are easy to put on and take off, the velcro straps stay in place all day and my feet do not hurt at night when I take them off. They are good appearance (black) and I wear them with formal business attire (suits) as a professional business man. I also have a more casual pair (white) for daily non-business wear. If you have foot problems - give them a try. I could not find any of my size in any store and had to estimate at the fit on the first pair (13-wide)and they fit perfectly. After 10 month's of daily use (10/hours/day/5-days a week) they show no noticeable wear. The nonskid soles are of great importance, although they do cause a squeak when wet(rainy days) and walking on marble corridors of some buildings. It goes away quickly as they dry. I highly recommend them."
151302,1,"I had knee surgeries on both knees in the 1970's when large segments of cartilage were removed compared to the minimally invasive surgery today. Because of this, I have to be very careful of the shoes I wear.What is required is a shoe with lots of padding and support. Wearing the Softspots Marathon allows me to have a pain-free day. If you have knee pain, you will not go wrong with the Marathon."
236343,1,"I bought this boot for my husband and they arrived this week, just in time for all the snow. When he came in from snowblowing, his feet were still warm and dry as if he were just going out!! Perfect for him, he said he love these boots and that they are very, very comfortable. So if you are looking for a good warm and waterproof boot that's not heavy, these boots are what you are looking for. Perfect for all of this Chicago snow we are having now!"
36106,1,"I was looking for a strong pair of shoes that would be worth investing in. Look no further. I trusted the 'Clarks' brand and i was duly rewarded. This shoe is waterproof to an amazing extent. It also has nice stitches on it that hold it together very well unlike other shoes which use glue. the insides are made for comfort and really take good care of your feet on long working / active days...I can attest to that, I'm a high school teacher."
25762,1,"These are some of the best shoes I have ever bought. Would recomend them to everyone looking for good fit, and good value."
103579,1,"This is a good shoe, but not an excellent one. I purchased it 3 months ago and it's holding well. It's very comfortable."
375581,0,"The shoe arrived promptly, the color was lighter than the picture and the fit is a little loose, but they are comfortable and soft. Good for leisure."
359521,1,"I brought these crocs for my husband..He's wanted a pair for the beach.He finds them comfortable, easy to take off and on, plus they are a casualslip on.."
303693,1,"I'd give them five stars but I think they're kind of ugly, not being a huge fan of the color orange. Using them for walking, about 5 miles a day, and so far they're holding up well and and are comfortable for the whole walk.Updating this review almost a year later: Still wearing these shoes, uppers still in good shape; still comfortable but about ready to be replaced, after holding up well for over 1000 miles! I'm going to try to replace them with the same shoe, I've liked them so well."
207486,0,"I purchased my rampante last week and tested it for twice so far. I have to say I am kind of dissapointed because I thought these were the perfect soccer shoes for me. The truth is the shoes are a little bit too narrow, and there is no improvment in shooting compared to cheaper shoes. I used to have lotto primato before and the shooting accurecy is same in reebok rampante. However reebok rampante's heel comfort is way advance than lotto primato, or other cheaper shoes. Nonetheless if you don't wanna pay $200 for a puma or adidas predator mania, reebok might be the second choice for you."
305022,1,It arrived on time as stated. It works good like expected with no complaints so far. I will consider ordering from this site again.
269714,1,"I tried surfing for the best price at shoe stores, but Amazon found me the best price at Bealls, in Florida. I walk on hospital cement floors all day. Rockports are more comfortable all day for me than other brand names I have tried. Thanks Amazon.com!"
326979,0,"The dye on these shoes comes off. I bought this to wear around the house and they are comfortable enough per the other reviews, but they turned the soles of my feet black after an hour of wearing it on the first day. My clean feet looked really dirty after wearing these although I was just walking around on carpet at home."
24543,1,"These are perfectly comfortable, I have had these boots before, so I knew I could not go wrong and the price was within my budget. I wear a ladies 5.5-6 and the 4.5 big kids fit great!"
242708,0,"I ordered a different model with the same brand for my daughter and the sizing wasn't even close. She had a 1.5 last year in the model that uses velcro so I ordered a 3 this year. They were smaller than the 1.5 last year. Her true foot size is a 3. Nothing bad with the quality of the shoe but the sizing needs some work. If you need to order this shoe, size up 1 to 2 sizes."
375677,0,"Update. I recently (8/2012) purchased a 3rd pair of Arroyo ll's from another vendor. The footbed in this (the Chocolate Brown/Woodrose) is very different from the previous two pairs I've owned. The heels of this pair is notably higher than the previous pairs I've owned. My heels get sore within an hour of putting them on.3/2012. This is the second pair of women's Arroyo II's I've owned. The Arroyo II seems to run a bit narrower than most other Keen shoes of this type which is just fine with me since my feet are narrow (2A). They are still a little wide for me even with medium weight socks, but I chinch them down tight. On the last pair of Arroyo II's I had, I added a second lace through the top two sets of loops so that I could tighten the heel more. It made all the difference on long walks on rough terrain. I will be doing the same on this pair as well. I also sometimes replace the footbed (inter-soles) if I'm wearing thiner socks. I always were socks with these shoes. Which brings me to my biggest problem with this shoe -- the accent color Sap Green. I would much prefer all neutral colors (browns, grays, blacks). Sap Green just does not go with many colors. This is an issue with me because I'd like to be able to wear this shoe everywhere (that a casual shoe would be acceptable) with my many colorful socks. My old, worn out Arroyo II's were brown with gray accents. Loved them. One additional observation--this is a rather heavy shoe at almost 13 oz per shoe."
271831,1,"speedy shipping, package arrived before estimated time of delivery.gladly do business with seller again any day of the week."
185936,0,"I bought these at the same time I bought a pair of Nike Basketball shoes.. both in size 12.5, I used the sizing guide on Eastbay to confirm the size I should buy. The Nike are a perfect fit, however these Adidas are way too small, and it is a very narrow shoe..The size is more like an 11 or 10.5, and the regular width is more like a narrow fit..Great looking shoe, very lightweight - just watch your sizing when you order this. I'd go at least a size larger, and a wide width if avaiable."

137502,0,"I buy this shoe for swing dancing. It's a standard shoe in the Lindy Hop community. However, there are some drawbacks to it. It has adequate padding for every day walking, but not dancing, especially when jumps are included. Thus, many of us put insoles into them. However, doing so causes the shoe to fit incorrectly and your heel to slip out when using your regular size, and using the next size up causes the shoe to fit incorrectly in the toe as well.If you dance regularly, this shoe wears out in about a year or two.I put suede on one pair for slickness, but not on a second pair, which I wear on slick floors for more traction. Friends of mine have complained that the current productions of this shoe are slick on the toe and heel and sticky on the ball, giving the shoe an inconsistent slickness and causing unpredictable results on the dance floor.So for every day wear, great! For dancing, ok, but better than other non-dance-specific shoes."
267565,0,"My hiking involves work. As a UPS driver I step in and out of my truck about 180 times a day. On top of that I deliver a lot of apartments, up and down roughly 800-1000 steps a day. I hoped these boots would have been more comfortable based on other reviews. They do fit well and may be ok for a few hours but beyond that if you are on your feet all day I can't recommend."
141624,1,"I love my Uggs! I decided to get this particular style because everyone has the original style. I enjoy being different. I wear them with boot cut Levi jeans and they look great. I even wore them to a night club and I received so many compliments. They are very fashionable, if you live in NYC. They are very comfortable and warm as well. 90% of the time I wear them without socks. I wear a size 8 1/2 but I purchased a size 8 because they run a little big. They are worth the money and I can tell they hold up well in snow. Thanks Amazon and Uggs!"
153032,1,"I'm a 27-year-old teacher with fibromyalgia and I hated that I had to enter an orthopedic shoe store, because I needed support and marshmallowy comfort to even consider leaving my home, so imagine my pleasure leaving the place with these! I adored this sandal so much, I bought it in 2 more colors (so now I have it in a mossy color, white, and bronze)! Its ankle-strap keeps me from going too far forward. The footbed is soooo comfy, yet supportive, and that, with its wide, soft leather straps, let me wear it on my worst, I-can't-stand-anything-touching-me days. Yet still, the way the foot-straps lie askew and a little further back from my toes, it doesn't look to old-woman-orthpedic-y. Even better, I wore one pair all day, every day, all summer and they're still almost like new."
265550,1,"wear them fall, winter, and spring. love these boots. I do use an innersole though.Great price from Amazon (the best I could find)"
87870,1,"They fit great, our daughter thinks they rock. They are easily adjustable with the ties. You might want to double knot them. Great for the price!"
324074,1,Arrived in a timely manner. However the seller neglected to state that the sandals are narrow width. Luckily they fit me fine.
204456,1,My elderly mother has bunions and hammers toes. She likes a little heel and these are perfect for her. This is the third pair she gets. These are also VERY durable.
121435,1,"I love this sneaker for my daugther, it goes with every outfit and is very easy to keep clean"
141446,1,"These were wonderful quality, upkeep with just saddle soap. The color was a pleasant dark gray and goes with everything. I have many pairs of Birkenstock sandals and these fit the same as all the others. I have back problems and appreciate the great foot support of these sandals."
243594,0,"I ordered a different model with the same brand for my daughter and the sizing wasn't even close. She had a 1.5 last year in the model that uses velcro so I ordered a 3 this year.

108883,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
282631,1,I can never get enough of Rainbow Sandals. I bought one for me and my boyfriend because it was about time to retire our old ones.
209196,1,Very happy with the size and look of this item. Have ordered these many years for my husband and he always says they are very comfortable and his favorite shoes.
164741,0,"The shoes run large so order a half-size lower than normal. They just didn't fit right on my Mom, she was really disappointed. Usually Easy Spirit is more true to size."
211911,0,"This shoe is okay, but not quite as comfortable as my Medley style or the AP1 style."
104269,1,"My feet hurt. Not so much in these shoes. That's about all there is to say, other than to add that I'm rather heavy, which causes most shoes to give up and blow out way before their time, especially running shoes. I've found that these can take the pounding that a daily two-mile walk gives them, and a bit more. I do add a thin gel insole, for my heel spurs and other aches and pains, but I doubt that has any impact on the Omni Grid 5's durability, which is OK.The almost all-mesh uppers make these much more comfortable than most ath. shoes that are labeled specifically for walking. So, although it's a running shoe, it's a more supportive, durable one, and I prefer it to the ""walking shoes"" out there."
319582,0,"This shoe ran big and I needed a half size smaller and a D width rather than a wide. The ad states the shoe has a soft crepe type sole but it came with a hard synthetic sole. It was not very flexible and it's been my experience that if a shoe needs much 'breaking in', it won't be very comfortable."
366223,1,Very comfortable. Much nicer then the last Keen I had.Love the black on black. The yellow looks great.Thanks
121779,1,"My favorite flip flop. Nicely contoured and cushioned footbed and quality leather uppers. Sole is durable and funky with the can opener attachment, although never got to use it (would have loved this in college though). My third pair. Replacing only because footbed material compresses after a few years and cushioning decreases. Sole and stitching still in good shape, even with heavy wear.Recommended."
52867,1,It are an old shoes but the price its really amazing. You should buy it.
94854,0,I purchased these to wear with my halloween costume. They look great but rub in several places so I am returning them. I tried walking around the house in them to test them out and it just won't work out without multiple bandaids and a gel insert for the instep. Pretty shoes. Wish I could wear them.
273946,1,"These boots seem to be very well made, and I have yet to slip on ice due to the super grippy soles. Of course, they look awesome.However, I bought the smallest size that Demonia makes (6), and they are too big all around. I'm generally a size 6, sometimes 5 1/2, but these feel closer to a 7 or 8 (I can't make my toes touch the end even if I try). Also, the boots stay up because they are stiff, but they are also loose on my calves and ankles. These are not designed for small and slender people."
49141,1,As ever I am more than satisfied with my purchase from an Amazon vendor. I received my boots within a week of ordering.
79998,1,Feel like I 40 yrs. younger. For a causal shoe for Santa these are Great. I really enjoy them feels great to be able to wear a really well made shoe. Thanks ConverseSANTA GARY
352724,1,"Very high quality slipper! The rubber sole is durable, and the lining is very warm. Perfect for cold feet after a long day."
347603,1,"Exactly what I was looking for. Quick with no hassles. Beats gas, time and crowds that are experienced when going to a brick and mortar store."
15592,1,Muy buen producto. Lo que esperaba.Lo recibi a tiempo. Ahora mi hija esta contenta.Lo que recibi fue lo mismo que vi en la PC.
275314,1,"I have bought about 20 pair of these boots over the past 6 or 7 years. I usually buy them 2 pair at a time and wear one for work and one for good.Even when you buy them at the buy one get one half price in stores the price on here is by far cheaper than anywhere else.They are comfortable, waterproof, last a long time and are light weight."
116863,1,I have wide feet and to top it off an annoying hammer toe. This is the second pair I ordered. Very comfortable.
209307,1,"This brand fits me very well, making it easy to order online which I have done more than a dozen times."
53480,1,These shoes have always been my favorite standby for summer. They have been around for years and I always have a pair or two in my closet.
3156,1,"I have been wearing these boots for 5 years there the best work boots I've ever purchased. I also seal them with sno-seal which really makes them water proof, keeps feet warm and dry in slush and snow."
288310,1,"Great shoes for wet wading or just hanging in the river. However, even though they are self bailing, they are not safe for swimming. I've had these for about 2 yrs and used thim many times. Last weekend my kayak got swamped in a waterfall and while trying to swim out, these shoes just about made me a permanent fixture of the river. So don't use them for swimming, they do not allow you to kick well to swim and the added weight of them after being completely submerged is a killer...literally"
5752,0,"I ordered this shoe directly from the Easy Spirit site. I ordered a medium width, and that is the marking the shoe is showing, but it is much too narrow for my foot, making it very uncomfortable. I made the mistake of not returning them, thinking that I could wear them and stretch them out: That didn't work. Guess I'll spend the money to take them to a shoe-shop to have them professionally stretched."
20145,1,"Most comfortable, longest lasting shoes I have ever owned. Very good value. I don't wear anything else."
86212,1,"I've had this shoe for about a year now. I find it to be very comfortable for about 8-12 hours a day. Anytime after that, my feet starts to throb. What I really love about this shoe is the arch support. With my flat feet this makes it really comfortable. If you can deal with the shoes almost but never slipping out of your feet than this shoe is a great buy. Beware, because these shoes are handmade each shoe fits differently and thus you may need to try different sizes to find your comfort level. As a reminder, they do stretch to accomodate the shape of your feet.I gave it 4 stars for the following reason: Lack of ankle support will make your ankles bend if you are rushing and not paying attention to how you are walking."
197751,1,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my son....he hasn't seen them yet but the overall service dealing with Amazon is always great & the shoes look pretty awesome, I think he will love them"
140495,1,"I have a ridiculously thin foot 5A. I love these sandals. They are comfortable and durable. If you have thin feet, you really can wear these sandals."
328833,1,"I am very pleased with these boots. So much so, I bought two pair each of both the brown & black! I didn't experience any of the difficulties cited by a few other reviewers regarding unsteadiness, slippage, etc. I've had no problems. These boots look adorable on and can be dressed up or down. For this price, you can't beat them!"
127438,1,"These are the ONLY shoes I've wanted this tear, and i found them here for the best price, after browsing the malls"
90093,1,"The work like they are supposed to, keeping your feet nice and dry. I would recommend them to someone who is looking for inexpensive rain boots."
270315,1,"These shoes allow me to be comfortable while looking good as a medical professional. I appreciate the extra width, the sizing is accurate. I liked them so much, I ordered a second pair the day after I received my first. I'm very satisfied with the Prowalker by Rockport."
191,0,"I purchased these on the basis the description stated they were waterproof. After 5 minutes walking in wet grass, my feet were soaking wet. On the other hand, these boots are extremely comfortable - when dry. If your looking for nice pair of hiking boots, under dry conditions, these are a great choice. Wet = 1 star, Dry = 5 stars, Overall = 3 stars."
368812,1,"In the ongoing quest for the perfect, small, Kindle sized bag, I ordered this bag thinking it would be the one. As a fulltime working mom, I need a bag that is strong and durable enough to handle my home life, and presentable enough to take to work. I also like a tiny to small bag as anything heavy is too much for my shoulders, and prefer crossbody as other bags slip off my shoulders. An added challenge recently is to find a bag that can fit my Kindle Fire and allow me to carry it comfortably (the Fire is quite heavy).The distressed nylon is a fantastic, durable fabric that (in black at least) looks both casual and office-worthy. The pockets in this bag are legendary, and the zippers work beautifully. The interior slip pocket (behind the zipper pocket) is just the right size for my Kindle in leather Roocase. This was a key feature for me as I don't want a bag where my kindle is flopping around or where it can lay flat and make a bag uncomfortable.The challenge with Ameribags is choosing the right size. Since I wanted the smallest bag possible, I ordered the Extra Small, but unfortunately the length doesn't work well for me crossbody. At 5'8"" with this 15"" bag, the length of it doesn't cross my back enough for a proper fit, particularly where the strap wraps at the side and across my chest. I worked fine on my shoulder, particuarly when carried the opposite way (with the bag at the front and strap at the back), but this isn't my preference for bags. I returned this and tried the FUL Ditty (also to be returned, see other review) and the Ameribag Distressed Nylon in Small and Large Baglett, both of which are keepers (see their reviews).If you're thinking about a Healthy Back Bag, you can't really go wrong with Amazon and their great return policy. If you're not going to carry it crossbody and/or are 5'4"" or less, this bag might be perfect for you."
309321,1,"I have never worn a more comfortable shoe. The shoes help your posture and balance, with just the right support and heel height. They take so much strain off my calve muscles because of the heel height. They are the best."
17624,1,The item came sooner than expected in excellant condition. I have purchased this shoe 3 times before so I knew I was getting a fine shoe at a decent price. Just be aware that the steele shank in this shoe will set off the metal detecter at the airport. No big deal just know you have to remove your shoes. Small price to pay for a comfortable shoe that has support as well. I have a bunion and the shoe comforms to my foot and feels great. Will definitely purchase again.
183334,1,Greatest Most durable boots I've ever purchased. I'm actually very surprised with these for the price I paid. All comparable boots in local stores were easily twice the cost. I'd highly reccommend these boots to someone who wanted something long lasting.
182546,1,I saw these at a local uniform store & they were too pricey for me. I did an online search and found them on amazon for 1/2 the price! They are very comfortable and so sharp looking! I expect these will stay cleaner being a dark color. I'm a nurse in Michigan and we are only allowed to wear navy and white. So happy to have found these shoes at a great deal!!
350190,1,"I've worn these VANELi dress flats for years and have them in several colors...and highly recommend them for both comfort and quality. They are expensive, so I always wait for sales. However, the last few times I've ordered these shoes on sale from this store on Amazon, the shoes have felt like they are at least a half a size too small. Sadly, I've had to return them."
265646,1,Had my first pair for seven years. Most comfortable shoes/boots I've ever found. Just a little too worn to look nice. I'll use them around the yard. Paid even less for the new pair than I did seven years ago. Thanks Amazon!
339126,1,"My orginal order was too big, however the instructions on how to reorder and ship back so as to maintain the free shipping offer were very clear and concise. The new pair arrived very quickly and were exactly as expected."
382213,0,"This product is well made, durable, warm and comfortable when properly sized to fit. The product was delivered on time and met my expectations upon first perusal however once worn my views changed slightly. The slippers run large to size, the black dye stains my feet (so I have to wear socks) and the black sole leaves black skid marks on my hardwood floors. Other than that they are great."
297618,1,"These boots are good quality, not too expensive, my kids love the camo. I am very pleased with this product."
6973,1,"I gave my 3.5 year old daughter, whose favorite color is pink, a pair of these for Christmas. They are adorable and, as my daughter puts it, ""extra fancy."" So far they seem comfortable, too."
58885,1,"These shoes are incredibly comfortable. One of the few shoes I've ever purchased that I can stand in them all day, and not complain about my feet hurting. It was a great buy, and the quality is excellent. Highly recommended."
219246,1,These shoes are really cute. Even if they are a little big they stay on the foot because of the backing. Look great!
336872,1,"This review is very deserving of 5 stars. My boyfriend needed a new pair of chucks for work that matched his uniform... we don't wear many other types of shoes.. Love chuck taylors! 5 stars for fast shipping, and low price. Thanks!"

197257,1,I was extremely satisfied. The shipping was BEYOND fast! I got my shoes the next day.My husband has some old blue ones and I wanted to get him ones in black. I checked for his shoe size for Chuck's (since they tend to be a size or a size and a half longer then the normal shoe size).
340603,1,"I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker."
188104,1,"Excellent value for the dollar here. Fit well, look good and very comfortable to wear."
111323,1,"I have searched all over my area for a pair of royal blue cleats for my son but with absolutely no luck. Before he settled for a black pair like ""everybody else had"" I decided to check amazon and thank goodness I did! We were able to find exactly what he wanted and they arrived before his next tournament game!"
362858,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
335939,1,"I typically wear a size 12D when it comes to sneakers and Sperry Original boat shoes. Stores in my area didn't have this particular model for sale, so I tried on Sperry Billfish for reference, as they are the closest to the Mako as I could find. Size 11D in the Billfish fit me perfectly, so I ordered the Mako in 11D. They are actually a little big, even when wearing thin socks (I can fit about my pinky finger between the back of my heel and the heel of the shoe). They're not too big to the point where I think it will cause too much discomfort in everyday use, but definitely the sizing seems to be a little inconsistent with Sperry. Sizing seems to be inconsistent with boat shoes in general as I wear a 10D in Timberland Earthkeepers. Other than the sizing, the quality of the shoe and materials is great, and the shoe feels of very high quality."
147944,1,"Most important is that the Stephanie pump is comfortable. It's true to size and still available in narrow (AA) widths. I'd like to be able to get (AAA). The colors are Black, white, taupe, Navy, and bronze."

16775,1,"to grip the ground very good, soft skin, hit the ball very stable. Only size is not competable with USA. According to Nike my shoes size is 9 but shoes size of Adidas is 8. It is so difficult for me when I give online order. This shoes is strongly recomended..."
247571,1,"I bought this shoe in August of last year. I have worn them for about 300 hours, most of that time spent standing and walking, and walked many miles in them in all weather and all kinds of pavement. I guess the wear I put on them might be a little above average. I love the fact that a $70 dollar pair of shoes is of such high quality, has a leather sole, and looks so good. My only complaint is that after a year of wear, the soles, especially the heels, are wearing very thin. The leather heel is very soft, and wears down to the wood very quickly, which looks a little ratty now. It's not too bad, and if I find a cobbler I'm sure I can get that taken care of, but it is an annoyance. I highly recommend these shoes, but don't expect the soles to last more than a few months of intense wear."
121067,1,"I bought these a while back, and have to tell you these are my favorite go-to sandals. Very comfy and good padding for lots of walking. Will buy more of this style, in other colors, come spring. They run true to size and width."
231714,1,"I am a huge Teva fan and have about 4 pairs in the original thong style. I wanted something a little more strappy and decided to give these a try since I already really enjoy Teva sandals. These did not disappoint. I have a wide foot so the straps need to be stretched out a bit so it took a few wears until they fit my feet better. After that they were perfect. I live in the city so I do a lot of walking and wanted something that wouldn't give me a ton of blisters. These worked well and have such a thick sole that there is no way these can't be comfortable for a days walk. Would recommend to anyone who does a lot of walking and wants I slightly nicer, very comfortable flip flop."
118686,0,"I realize dance slippers run small, so I ordered my niece an ENTIRE size up from her normal. Still way too small. I would seriously recommend you order a size, maybe even two sizes up from what your little one normally wears.."
244475,1,I ordered a size 7 and a 1/2 and they fit perfect. That is my usual size in a shoe. I like how the heel is wide so it is easy to balance. They are plain but I wanted a shoe that could go with a lot in my wardrobe. I wear eyecatching tops so the focus is not on my shoes. I would recommend them.
303222,0,"They need to note on this listing that in Capezio world woman's size 3 is a child's size 1. So if you buy your kid with size 3 feet a size 3, you are going to get a shoe that is way too small! It's very irritating, cause at this age/size, you can't buy from the listing that have child sizes anymore. Otherwise the shoes look very nice. You do have to start sewing on the elastic now - not like the Daisy's that come with it presewed. Just do the math and make sure you get the right size."
100294,0,"These shoes look adorable, but they're inexpensive and it shows. I bought mine in white patent and I'm satisfied considering the price. I think I'll be wearing them on Halloween or other special occasions that call for fun dress up. They're not hard to walk in, the heel is high but it's stable and the platform is high enough so that it's pretty easy if you're used to walking in heels at all. I wear a size 9 reliably but I've bought Pleaser shoes before and they run small so I ordered a 10. My feet were swimming in them. I returned them (thanks for making it so easy Amazon!) and ordered my 9 and they're a little tight in the toes, but not bad. Overall great dress up fun, but the quality is not great."
316112,1,This is the third pair of these shoes I have bought. All different colors. They are great to wear in the office in the summer.
227293,1,Good ppl had a problem with my tracking number so i emailed them and with great responce my questions were answered..
35386,1,These shoes are one of a very few I have been able to wear all day without a break-in period.
172920,1,"The shipping was quick (arrival to my home in about 3 business days) with standard shipping and the product was exactly as described. My only real qualm with this shoe, which was the first K-Swiss shoe of this style I've ever purchased, was that the heel cuff on the back took a little while to break in. This being the case, I ended up suffering a very tiny blister on the upper part of my heel from the first few days in these shoes. Of course, this may just be my foot measurement or a flaw in the manufacturing and is certainly not a reflection of the seller here on Amazon.Thanks!"
381173,1,As a soccer player I have been wearing Sambas for over 20 years. The quality and foot support of this sneaker is undeniable and the product itself has maintained it's status as a 'goto' sneaker for soccer players. You see these shoes everywhere (often times the black version). When you combine the build of the shoe with a very reasonable price tag it is not surprising that Sambas are still as popular as they ever were.If you are used to a running shoe the wear might feel a little different as I feel like the Sambas give you a 'flatter' wear in the sole. They aren't as springy as a running shoe. This is just a matter of preference. They still offer great arch and foot support.I would definitely recommend Sambas to anyone looking for a casual everyday sneaker or someone who plays indoor soccer.
371754,1,"Comfortable shoe, modern styling. I bought the black/black style, which I think would work well with jeans or black khakis, though not dress slacks. It's definitely a casual shoe. My shoes are marked under the tongue ""Made in China, leather upper, balance man-made materials"". Although these uppers are supposed to be leather, with the rest made of synthetic materials, there is an overpowering plastic smell and I don't smell any leather."
108283,0,"These are definitely cushy, but the arch support is not as good as advertised. It feels more like a little pebble under the arch of your foot than a full arch support. Also, they seem to be a little narrow for a regular width - I don't know if it is just that the straps are tighter than what I'm used to, or really are narrow. Bottom line, they are not as comfortable as my Crocs flip-flops."
61364,1,Had my first pair for seven years. Most comfortable shoes/boots I've ever found. Just a little too worn to look nice. I'll use them around the yard. Paid even less for the new pair than I did seven years ago. Thanks Amazon!
202063,0,"Bought for son, who loved the comfort. Within a few months, inner sole began peeling and the tongue has come almost completely off."
326316,1,"Been wearing these for a bit now and thought I'd write a review...These boots are quite comfortable, and I don't say that lightly. I have been wearing boots of some kind since I was 12 and while in the US Army, and these are one of the most comfortable I have tried yet. They fit well and feel very durable. The oiled leather has a great feel to it that simply says quality. I have no doubt that with proper maintenance they will last a good long time. All of that said my only gripe, and the reason I gave them four stars is that, as mentioned by another review, the shafts are quite narrow. My feet are not huge at 9.5D but these are difficult to get on, and downright hard to get off. Almost to the point of needing help to get them off, but I personally don't mind a tighter fit. I wear a medium padding merino wool blend hiking sock with them. It makes these boots quite comfortable, but it nearly pulls the sock off when taking them off. Would I suggest them to a friend? Yes. Will I buy another pair when and if these wear out? Yes. Are they right for you? Not a clue."
100088,1,"These flip flops are SO comfortable! When I walk it really feels like I am walking on a sponge or cloud or something really soft. I also have really high arches and I can walk around all day in these and my feet feel great.I am a woman and bought these shoes because after having my twins my feet have gotten wider so all of my women flip flops were too narrow. I actually think these shoes run small in the lenght, probably 1 size small in my opinion. I had read some reviews elsewhere about them running small so I orderd a mens size 8 which is a womens size 10 and they fit me perfectly. I in no way wear a size 10 in womens shoes, I wear an 8 1/2(womens) sometimes a 9. They also aren't too wide, I tried on some other mens flip flops in the store and they were really wide on my foot and looked manly. These don't look girly at all but they are plain enough that they can work just fine for a man or women.As another reviewer mentioned, the straps do feel a little tight at first but losen up when you wear them, they aren't uncomfortable at all though, first time I wore them they were still really comfy. I have the chocolate and black color and love both of them."
379710,1,I ordered a different pair before they were really tight. But This brand comes in a wide and makes dancing more comfortable.
313926,1,"I love this boot. I rarely order shoes over the internet, but these caught my eye. They look good and they feel wonderful. I wore them all day and my feet were not uncomfortable. They keep my feet warm in snow and cold weather. I am so happy I bought these boots."
250713,1,I absolutely love theses boots! I haven't stopped wearing them since I received them a few weeks ago. They fit well and are very comfortable after breaking them in a little. My only complaint is that they squeak quite a bit when walking.
181700,1,I ordered these shoes but were too narrow. Sent back for an XW. Received new pair very quickly from The Denim Shop. We are very pleased with the quality and fit of the shoes. Will shop at The Denim Shop again.
200572,1,"I've had these for about 2 years now and I love them. Sperry's are comfy and go with everything. I wear them most everyday and I don't even think about it. I had the classic sahara color for a long time and decided to go a little more riske. Well this color is nearly as traditional and the contrast sole is a great look. They match with everything, and arguably with more than my sahara sperry's that look a little too similar to khaki color pants. Love them"
245376,0,I ordered an 8-1/2 and rec'd an 8 so I had to return them ~ I decided after seeing them that they were toooo flat and the company gave me a refund with no problem ~ They even refunded my shipping and handling....
35686,0,"I love these shoes. They are comfortable and I was looking for something I could simply slip on when running into town. HOwever, I would recommend buying a half a size, or even one size up. They are ""tight"". The back of your foot just just fits inside the shoe. I'm a size ten (10).Otherwise, great little shoe."
19838,1,I got these boots as a birthday gift for my husband who sometimes experiences foot pain even in his sneakers. They did not disappoint and he likes them very much as they are comfortable and give a good arch support. They are casual enough to wear with jeans but look good enough for church too. They have taken him from Michigan to Florida a couple of times without trouble and a cinch to remove at the airport. A good buy and worth the few extra bucks.
332464,1,"The Dockers Men's Gordon Cap Toe Oxford, Cordovan color is an excellent shoe, very stylish, great color but unfortunately was too narrow. Regretted having to return the shoes, but there wasn't really any alternative."
371621,2,I loved the looks of these... until i put them on my feet.The plastic was too stiff and they weren't comfortable at all.I returned them.
136739,1,My teenager loves these Chuck Taylor's and he is so happy that he received them for his Christmas present.He says they are very comfortable and they look good with his skinny jeans too!Also a great price too.
209058,1,"I've worn the classic Top-Sider's for 25 years. The local retailers want to push the higher priced versions that i have tried and do not like. They tell me that I need to move beyond them ... no thanks, i love this classic shoe!"
366971,1,"i purchased these for my lady and she says they fit good and are very comfy,,"
57030,1,The shoe was exactly what I was looking for and the price was better than on Keds own web site.
17960,1,"My [...] daughter has a narrow foot and it is hard to find a good fitting athletic shoe for her. But this is the second time she has had this Stride Rite, and it is a perfect fit! We will buy a third time if it is still available.Suzanne,Tacoma, WA"
91934,1,They are not only made well but comfortable and durable. Timberland makes a good product and they last (my last pair must have been 10yrs +). Throw in a good price and you can't loose.
305688,1,i have owned at least 6 pairs of this shoe over the past 20 years
3509,1,These arrived quickly fit great and are very comfortable. I bought these for general use during colder months to replace sneakers.
180312,1,"My son wanted either red or green Chuck Taylors which are fairly difficult to find. The shoes I bought arrived quickly, were good quality, and were priced very reasonably."
193828,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
113732,1,"Eastland Newports are good strong leather shoes. I am a teacher and I walk around my classroom a lot during any given day. My Eastland Newports are very comfortable and roomy; therefore, my feet don't hurt at the end of the day! The wide width, coupled with the fact they go with almost any pant outfit from khakis to jeans, make the Eastland Newports my choice of casual shoe!"
136420,1,"These shoes are great,they can be worn down with jeans and a tee or worn with nice dress clothes.I'm getting the ones in pink.Get these shoes if considering.Very comfy also[Holla Back]"
331465,1,"Crocs are great, very comfortable, easy to clean, fast on and off. Great for poolside or just hanging around the house. I personally wouldn't wear them out but now I have a pair, I've seen them on nurses, office workers and educators."
345574,1,The shoes arrived very quickly and the correct size. They are very comfortable despite being taller of a heel than I expected.
365108,1,Bought as a replacement for kid brother. Item as describe! Size is true and recommended for teens since shoe does not go out of style.
269230,1,"I have owned a lot of boots in my lifetime, trying different brands to find a fit and quality that matched the expense. I've found comfortable shoes that lacked support (Dr. Marten's 8287s), supportive and durable, but on the tight side (Caterpillar Alaska FX) and had mixed results with Durham, Propet, Wolverine, Sebago, New Balance, Lugz, Worx, Carolina, Eastland, Stacy Adams/ SAO and other brands. There have been some great feeling shoes that looked and functioned more like tennis shoes as far as materials and styling, but I've been hard pressed to find legit work boots with a soft toe, accurate true to size measurements, comfort out the box, and support. We'll see how the sole holds up since it's got tons of cushion and at best a 1/4"" of rubber tred, but so far they are a dream to move in. The last in the boot shifts your foot onto you toes and has a high instep with the heel ( at least for a flatfooted guy like me who can't slip a piece of paper under his arches), so it put more weight on my bad ankle (ruptured tendon 2 years ago) than I would like but for it to be on my toes i feel good. This is especially important given i had reconstructive surgery on both feet 21 years ago where they broke 6 of my toes. The surgery was a flop and my toes are hammered with 0 range of movement in the joints, offering minimal support and weight displacement so the lion' share of my weight resides on the balls of my feet if i am walking properly, forefoot striking first. This can get very painful if I'm in bad shoes, as can the impact of those strikes on the tips of my toes since they curve into the sole, rather than the pads of my toes, like normal people. None of this has been an issue in these boots. I feel like i could run a track meet in them , that's how much spring they've put in my step!UPDATE: I was going downstairs a few months back and missed the last two steps and came down HARD on my left ankle, in which I ruptured a tendon. I felt gravity take hold and just KNEW I was going to wreck my ankle something fierce with all my weight coming down on it with added velocity. Well, HALLELUJAH for Thorogood cause I swear my boots went ""Boing!!!"" The amount of Cushioning in the heel (that entire gray area you see in the picture is foam, it's not EVA I think, which is fine because it's better!) absorbed the impact so well I was shocked. I have a pair of Nike Shox and They don't even offer that level of shock absorption and weight displacement. Absolutely Phenomenal. All this and they have offered enough support that my lateral movement while moving large/ heavy objects hasn't aggravated my ankle, though I have to double-knot the laces as they do tend to slip and come loose.But yes, these are the best boots I have ever owned. Just keep a little boot oil handy to touch up scuffs (I use Dr. Marten's, which doesn't augment the color of the finish, so long as you don't transfer color from one pair of boots to another via using the same sponge on dissimilarity colored boots) , and use Armor All Leather whips to clean them and you'll be good to go."
67528,1,I ordered these for my daughter for christmas she loved themshe has been wearing them everyday even when we have had 70 degree weatherthank you
322002,1,"I really like these! They are super comfortable and move nicely. However, sizing information is super confusing. The size chart is confusing so I looked to reviews for help. They were even more confusing. I ended up buying my street shoe size, and they are just a little too big. I probably could've gotten away with a 5 1/2 (I wear a 6). But other than that they are great!"
77620,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
228313,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
281523,1,"From the first time I saw these shoes I knew I had to have them. They are very stylish, go great with jeans, and are extremely comfortable. Also didn't hurt that I was able to get them for about $35 less at Amazon than anywhere else was selling them for if they even had them. My new favorite pair of shoes."
25337,1,"A wonderful boat shoe. A great fit, support and stylish. Wish I could have bought more in any color available."
179897,1,"I have these shoes in brown. I have been complimented several times on these shoes, and they match everything. I don't dress for comfort, but these are pretty comfortable. The only problem is that they look old quickly."
219115,0,"I desperately needed a blue flat when I bought this shoe. It's very comfortable and durable, but I'm not thrilled with the design."
16301,0,"I REALLY LIKE THE LOOKS AND COMFORT OF THESE SHOES . HOWEVER , THEY ARE IMPROPERLY SIZED . I WEAR A 12D AND THIS SHOE IS ABOT 1/2 TO 1 SIZE LARGER THAN A 12 . WHEN PLACED HEEL TO TOE WITH ANY SHOE THAT I OWN , THEY ARE MUCH LONGER . A FRIEND MADE A COMMENT ON THER LENGTH ."
320607,0,"These slippers were ok, but definitely run wide. In street shoes I wear a 10 or 10.5 and I often size up to an 11 in loafers or ballet flats to accomodate my slightly wide feet. I ordered a 10W since these slippers are not offered in an 11, and they were loose even with the drawstring completely tightened. I ended up exchanging for a pair of Blochs, which come in longer lengths."
124890,2,These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size. I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks. The shoe literally slipped of my foot.
77816,1,"Have been wanting a pair or Frye harness boots forever, just recently found out they made them in wide sizes. They fit pretty true to size, have decent arch support, and feel like armor on your feet. The leather is heavy and can be a little warm in the summer. My only real complaint is that the toe is REALLY squared off. Almost unfashionable. Still, all in all, very good boots made in America."
200015,0,I'm really an 11.5 (US)so perhaps this is a little unfair... I ordered Size 12M and it is was way too wide and a little too roomy at the front. However the quality is pretty good and it's quite an attractive shoe so I've inserted insoles and I'm good to go!!!
367137,1,"This is the second one of these that we purchased. I like the heated option, it makes all the difference when you need to dry boots or shoes quickly. The problem that we experienced was with the knob on the product, it was poorly constructed and broke prematurely."
36218,0,"I have used these boots everyday for about a year, and put them through the paces for sure. I Have owned many pairs of hiking boots in this price range.So we'll start with those perty green laces, throw them out as soon as you get them. They wont keep tied, and will very quickly break. I think mine lasted almost a month, and during that time I would have to be constantly reminded that my shoes were untied...they were an annoyance to say the least, complete garbage if you really want to know. The cuff on the ankle is about a half inch too low and does not fully support the ankle. The leather is 1 piece, and have kept my feet very dry. The leather is also too soft, they again don't give any ankle support. I work a job that requires I have 100lbs+ on my back in remote mountain locations. These boots will offer NO support for sprains.The plus side is that they break-in almost immediatly, week-week and a half, and they wont cause blisters during that time. The boot is also very comfortable. The Goretex lining really helps with drying the boot after tromping through mud and swampy trails. The eyelits and hooks are very burly. ALL of my other boots have had the eyelits pop out, leaving pencil diamater holes in them. The sole is good, I walk up wet slippery bedrock without any concern. They still have about 25% tread left.So here's the deal, If you are planning on wearing these boots every once and a while and only taking day hikes with small weight on your back, If your into ""urban"" fashion then these boots will be fine. But If you require a little more ankle protection, If you want a boot that will last, I have to reccommend you buy LIMMER boots. They are made in the US, they have an unlimited lifetime warranty I.E will literally last forever, and they cost about the same. The down side is that they are much stiffer, meaning you have to suffer a very brutal break-in period, and they have to be worn fairly regulary to maintain that break-in. So if you think these boots have a tough break in two suggestions don't buy this boot, and grow a pair, Danners are practiclly slippers.I also have a big concern with the Danner Website who directly controls what reviews are posted and ultimatly seen by their prospective buyers. Meaning that they don't want people to know the actual quality of their boot, they just want people to buy them. I feel duped into buying these after having read all of the glowing reviews on their site. These boots are NOT as good as you might imagine from reading the reviews, don't be fooled. Today I went to post on their review page and my review was rejected. It was a 3 star review! Very disapointed with the company's attitude towards its customers."
380490,1,"I wore the new sandals to New Orleans, did lots of walking and the shoes proved to be very comfortable."
377772,1,"I think these are great shoes. They've held up well and my toddler is constantly on the move. Also, they are easy to wipe off which is a plus."
280094,2,"I suffer from severe swelling of my legs and feet and ordered these slippers and paid a huge premium to have them delivered on a Sunday. Not only did they not deliver them the next day, they didn't refund any of the shipping costs and waited almost a week to ship them with it taking several more days in transit. The item didn't fit so at great difficulty and pain to get to the post office to return them. Because I used Amazon's method to return the item I have no record that the item was returned. So I don't have the mechandise, I'm out of pockect for the purchase price and the huge fee for sending the item next day.I'll tell you one thing - if I ever have to return something to Amazon again I am NOT going to use the Amazon Return Authorization paperwork. It's sad that the only recourse I have is to warn others about this vendor. But I mostly hold Amazon.com responsible for the entire problem.Sure the cost to return the item was free but who cares when I am now $56 out of pocket for an item that sells for $38.95. Sad part is that this item was fulfilled by Amazon LLC."
360614,1,"The shoes do run small so I ordered one size up based on previous reviews. My feet are wide at the toes so I stretched them overnight and now they fit and feel great. My feet hurt after 12 hr nursing shifts with special shoes, but I can square dance in these for hours and feel fine. Almost wish I could wear them to work!"
186943,1,"I have flexible flat feet and tend to pronate. While this shoe is not as good as Brooks Addiction, it is lighter and moves more easily. I only wish I had known it was available in narrow width. I expect that would have made it an even better fit and more help with my pronation problem. It does accept my custom orthotics. I ordered a pair for my mother as well as myself and she loves hers. She has serious mobility problems but these shoes in her narrow width and size 10 make walking much more stable and safe for her. We will certainly order them again. They look good too!"
365477,1,A great shoe with a classic look. These are nicer for wet days than the canvas and are lasting longer. They look great & are well made.
150031,1,"This is a great sandal except it runs 1 size too big. I am a size 8, and ordered a size 8, but it's about an inch too long. I would have needed a size 7 I guess."
271805,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
4556,1,These are an excellent quality and comfortable work boot. I spend 9-12 hours a day wearing these and have never found them uncomfortable. They are by far the most comfortable work boot Ive worn.
199637,1,"These shoes are the most comfortable shoe I've owned. I have bone spurs in my heels, plantar fasciitis, and am overweight, and these shoes make me feel lighter and without so much pain, like I am wearing comfortable slippers, except with support. I will definitely buy more."
134235,1,Ordered the shoes and they were too small. Sent them back and they were replaced in time for me to play in our next golf event.Thanks guys!
53489,1,I love this product and I received it in a very timely manner. I have absolutely no complaints except maybe it's my fault I got white keds because now they are pretty dirty haha but I knew that would happen. I recommend everyone get a pair of shoes like these! And from this site. Just wish there was free shipping...
340183,1,Girlfriend loved them. Price was better then local area stores. She has other colors of the same shoe so they last a lifetime.
278413,1,"These shoes are great. Probably the most comfortable shoe I've ever had. These shoes make me want to stop wearing Vans because of how durable and comfortable they are. Style of the shoe is awesome. If you're looking for a shoe with a ""fat"" tongue then these are the shoes for you. Would definitely buy another pair or a pair just like them. You don't have to be a skateboarder to get these. I don't really trick skate anymore, but I've always been a fan of the Accel. The all black Accel is so cool and fashionable, which means they go with any style of clothing, any color, and so on. Umm, just all around great buy. FIT TRUE TO SIZE. Recommend getting them in your most common shoe size if you like them snug and want the shape to stay the same after months of wearing them. If don't care about the shape, then get a half size bigger. Either way the size will still be very comfortable."
197159,1,I ordered these boots overnight. They arrived faster than I expected and work better than I expected. They are very comfortable and don't get to hot. I am really hard on shoes and go through them fast but these are holding up very well. I would recommend these boots for anyone that needs durable work boots.
60432,0,"only worn twice but seems decent quality for price, tongue is set low so wont be waterproof past halfway point and size seems pretty accuratehard bare inside so should use an insert"
208438,1,"I find this pair of Reebok running shoes to be of excellent quality. They are very comfortable and cushion the shock of walking. I am past the running age, so I need a good foundation and arch support. The price was right also. Reebok is the best name in sport shoes in my estimation. Thank you. I hope this helps."
103031,1,Beautiful leather and a lot of class for the money. Very comfortable to wear all day. Love these shoes. No need to speak further!
159045,1,I would be very greatful if u can let me know if the white chucks is one size bigger then nornal sizing cause I didnt see the remarks like on the black ones.Thanks
86254,0,"This was my first purchase of Dansko shoes, after glowing reviews from coworkers. I got sized in a local store, but couldn't pass up the discounts on Amazon. Problem is, each shoe is handmade, so sizing is very inconsistent. I've also heard from multiple sources that Dansko as a brand has slipped in quality control now that they've shipped production to China. The pair I got had size 39 on the packing slip, outside of the box, and stamped into the sole of the shoe. However, the imprinting inside the shoe said it was a 38. I'm not sure what size they were meant to be, but they were much too small. Amazon was great with getting me a replacement quickly. Unfortunately, the second pair was not much better. This pair was a 39 by all written accounts, but the left shoe was considerably smaller than the right shoe. I know most people have one foot that is slightly larger than the other, but I've never had this problem with any other shoes. I'm not sure if this has to do with the shoes being handmade, but I'd definitely call this a mismatched pair. So I've had to return both pairs. Very please with how Amazon customer service handled the issue, but I think I'll have to try to find this product someplace locally to purchase in-person."
208328,1,This is my third color in the levee flat- fits true to size-and it looks as good dressed up or down.
360284,1,The shoes arrived quickly and as described. They are very comfortable& a quality product. They do tend to run a half size small so if you order them get them a half size larger. Beautiful craftmanship.
153769,1,I ordered these and they were too big which I should've known. I almost didn't return them because I liked them so much. But I did and the return process was so easy. I will definitely order from this vendor again. Hopefully the right size this time!
321001,0,It is pretty good in general but the colour in definitely not pink. It is like skin colour so it didn't match the Leotard and the skirt which I ordered for my little child from Capezio also.
62761,1,Worn keds my whole life. Still love them. This is my daughters second pair of black. Think it's so cool that as a teenager she wears them.
70855,1,"I bought a pair of these flips for regular pool deck use after a cheaper, Chinese flop flapped off and nearly broke my neck on a wet pool deck.They are absolutely terrific, albeit purchased (in my case) from a less costly closeout rack.Still, I am glad to have them, and recommend them highly."
53597,1,"My new keds are so awesome! They look exactly like the picture. I am so happy that I got these. They are comfy and stylish, and when they wear out, I will buy from amazon!"
188331,1,"I bought these pointe shoes for my daughter who is studying to become a professional ballerina. The pointe shoe manager at her ballet school fit her in these because of the shape of her feet - and especially her short toes. While she has small, boxy feet, these shoes, with their shorter vamp, make them look long and elegant. The shoes are well made and last as long as any other pointe shoe on the market."
226854,1,"I love these converse so much. They run about 1/2 size too big, which is fine for me, but overall these are my favorite pair of shoes that I own."
183103,1,"I saw this TSUBO shoes while travelling in Asia a year ago. I didn't wanted to buy them since I didn't knew the brand and it was too expesive there (about $110 USD) Since then, I was curious about what was behind the shoes (which is a Japanese brand). I looked into Amazon and with surprise I found them and decided to purchase the shoes. I need to admit that I am greatly satisfied!: they look great and fit excellent, they are light and your feet doesn't feel ""trapped"" inside as they are wider than normal shoes. My only complain is that I am size 11.5 and normally 11 is too tight, therefore I decided to get a 12 (45 in European) and I feel them a bit bigger than normal, but despite that I feel that my feet are very thankful for having such space to breath.Fernando"
78242,1,Very cute my husband is 67 but he still loves his converse allstars! Thanks!! Every thing is up to loving!
100660,1,"Beautiful comfortable shoes. I walk three miles to work every day and teach all day long, so I'm literally standing for 8 hours a day. These shoes are classy and offer excellent arch support. This is my fourth pair of Sperry's, and definitely not my last. (They shipped quickly, too.)"
152810,0,"I have a pair of UGGS that are over 16 years old. They were made in New Zealand and of higher quality. Now UGGS are made in China and it shows/feels. After verifying authenticity and trying on my boots...they feel so flimsy, but what can one do?My old pair finally started to wear out on the inside behind the heel. They are still ok with a double pair of socks, but I wanted a taller pair of boots. The toes on my old boots are reinforced with another strip of suede. It feels really strange putting on my new ones as they don't have that reinforcement and feels like it will wear out over time in the toes.Hopefully I will be proved wrong."
142767,1,"This is a nearly perfect shoe. It fits well, is comfortable, and can be worn with many different colors. I would love to have more in additional colors."
320483,1,We were eager to kind a pair of kids wrestling shoes for our son who needed them for his first tournament.We called around to find the most cost effective pair considering that he would outgrow them before next season. We found what we were looking for within Amazon.The order process was simple and the confirmation and tracking emails were easy to use. We were most impressed when the shoes arrived ahead of schedule. The external packaging was secure and inside the shoes arrived within the original factory box.The quality of the product is excellent and we will use this shopping option in the future.
348359,1,"My first pair of ECCO shoes were the Track IIs. I wore them almost every day, they were the most comfortable shoes I had. The sole did come apart after 3 or 4 years. They are expensive, but they lasted a long time. I've now got 3 other pair of ECCO shoes, I love that the sizing is very consistent and they are all comfortable and look good.I recently found that www.nushoe.com can resole, repair stiching and refinish ECCO shoes. I still had my old Track II's in the bottom of a closet and sent them in. Looking forward to getting them back. The resoled shoe is a vibram rubber sole, not the poly original sole. So we'll see how that works. They claim they will have the same comfort as the original."
294633,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
301610,1,"The Puma Men's Roma Shoe is simple but classy, yet good for everyday use. A great selection of colors assures that you'll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe. Not only do these shoes look good, but they feel good also. I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile!"
22907,0,They kind of hurt my feet. Maybe I have the wrong size. They're cute though !
45580,1,"It's very good product. It's not too confortable like the other brands. So, if you spent a little more bucks, you can buy one better product."
206865,1,He said that the shoes fit - to that means that Amazon was right in the sizing. He liked them a lot - he said that they were comfy and light.Thank you - from me - Amazon for the comfortable price of $29.00. Very nice!And He says thank you - To Amazon for coming through with this miricle shoe.
299203,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
206591,0,"I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
50170,1,these boots a great just gotta break them in. which will take me prolly a good week of wearing. got a good deal too. about 2 days after i placed my ordered they went up like $20!
244835,1,"I love my boots I wear them almost everyday,I received my boots within a matter of days alot sooner than expected."
254713,1,"I would truly recommend this pair of shoes. Its soft suede leather and crepe sole gives me real comfort when I'm wearing them. They have a wide range of colors to choose from to complement whatever jeans you're wearing. Because i like them so much, I'm planning to buy another pair soon."
366908,1,Please get some more sizes in. I need to buy a few new pairs! These are the best shoe on earth!
85545,1,"This is the most comfortable sandal I have ever worn. I bought a second pair for wearing outside because I use the first pair as slippers. The insole is like walking on a cloud, a dry cloud. The front straps are adjustable. The fit is true. I can wear them all day long. I have had shoes and sandals that gave me blisters on my bunions or corns on my toes. Not these. I hope Propet never stop making them.Mary"
30060,1,"I have been a huge fan of the 760 series, starting with the 762, and all the way up. These are the best yet. Perfect support, and extreme comfort. They work with you to get great workouts. Buy them while they still have your size!"
137178,1,"I got mine from a Converse store in a mall near St Louis for $20. I've had them for 2 and a half years and have worn them everywhere. I ran a 10 minute Mile and a half in them twice for my Air Force PT Test. I've worn them in Iraq, Kuwait, Arizona, Florida, Washington. they are a part of me. Truly an epic shoe. They're also a great driving shoe, with a nice rolled heel after some wear, and great pedal feel. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice all around, everyday shoe."
82159,1,"I received my order of two pairs of this particular shoe, today, and couldn't be more delighted! For starters, they are WONDERFULLY comfortable...right out of the box! They look VERY expensive, and appear to be ""handcrafted"". I am buying another pair, for good measure! Thanks to Amazon.com's shoe sale, I appreciate my good-fortune in having spent relatively little money for a ""world"" of timeless style and comfort!"
127071,1,They feel comfortable and true to size. The black and white go with everything. I'll be buying this same pair again.
273404,1,"Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot, Grey/Grey,9.5 M US great boots for work or very day life very comfortable, worm and soft inside great boots for fare value."
186801,1,I am fetish modeland I like to use these boots on the show and photosessionsTHEY ARE SUPER GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14569,0,"This shoe looks great with various outfits, including shorts, skirts & capris. Not true to size. I ordered a 7W but shoe fits like a medium width. Very rare for LifeStride shoes, most wide widths fit perfectly."
275696,1,"I bought this pair back in May 12 and they haven't let me down at all. Snow, heat, and rain, no problems here. They keep my feet warm without having to wear extra thick socks. The Hi-Tecs are completely waterproof and I have not had any internal leaks. Good solid buy for the budget minded person."
226596,1,I bought these for my mother who has had lifelong shopping issues in regards to her feet. She said she loves these shoes and they fit wonderfully.
112205,1,"HELP!, I need somebody, HELP! Not just anybody....and soforth. I cant buy these shoes ANYWHERE!!! Ive searched all over and they either dont have them in my size or I just cant buy them. this site wont let me buy them cuz it isnt listened as a product i can buy... i have no idea why. If any1 has any information on where i can get my hands on these shoes please email me at: stevemosca@hotmail.com"
299674,1,"These Birkenstock Birkoflor Arizona Sandals are exactly what I have come to expect from Birkenstocks. They are uncommonly comfortable. This is my third pair of Arizona sandals over the past thirty years. I wear them constantly, and they remain comfortable and incredibly durable, and you can send them to Birkenstock and have them ""rebuilt"" when they begin to wear out - and it takes them a very long time to become worn out. My last two pairs of Arizona sandals have been Birkiflor rather than leather. It's a personal preference to avoid leather. Buy Birkenstock products with complete confidence."
43883,1,I always have several pairs of these shoes in my house -- ordering and receiving them online through Amazon was easy. I recommend both the shoe and the process.
382933,1,"Hello, These boots aren't perfect, but for $100 bucks they're not bad. The red boots are dark red and a brighter red on the inside so if you turn them down the colors don't match. My girlfriend takes size 8 1/2 shoes usually, sometimes she gets a size 9 in tall heels and they fit well. These boots only come in whole sizes so we naturally chose size 9. They were just a little too big. In the description it says 27"" up from the arch is 17"" around, this is not true. The boots are 27"" up from the arch, but it's 19"" around at the top. My girlfriend's calves are 12 3/4 and her thighs at that height are 17"" so I thought they would be just right, but they are just a little loose. I think an 8 would be too small. So if your calves and thighs are an inch or so more than the size I've listed here and you take a regular size 9, then the 9's will fit you perfect. The ties in the back can be made looser but not tighter than 19"" around. It would've been nice if you could tighten them but you can't. And there is very little arch support, which makes her walk on the balls of her feet. (she has other equally tall shoes that don't do that)Having said that. They are VERY sexy. She has no intention of wearing them out. She said they make her feel naughty sexy, and she easily slips into that persona when wearing them. I bought some red micro g-string panties and a short red skirt...absolutely WOW..A little loose or not, these boots are NOT going back.don't just say they were too tight. tell us the size you bought and the measurements of your legs. Too big or too small doesn't tell us anything.The quality isn't very high, and the size is a little hit or miss, but to me,..they're worth every penny."
387939,1,I ordered the wrong size and they where returned and new size sent without any delay. Thanks for the good service
124822,1,"These are perfect Pirate boots, along with the added bonus of being cute enought to wear as regular foot wear. The only down side is they are a little difficult putting on. I had some trouble getting my foor & heel past the ankle area. Oh and you'll need a hand pulling them off. Since they are so long you can't rest your leg on your knee to pull them off because then you're holding the boot in place. On the whole, I love these boots and can totally see my boyfriend really enjoying helping me out of them. *winks*"
207531,1,I have had 4 pairs of these shoes.They are very comfortable.These are true topsiders... they grip the deck.They look more stylish than traditional topsiders.There is one problem; I bought a pair of the 2-tone tremonts... the dye bled into my socks badly!
237416,1,I really like the way the Kasey clogs look. They are perfect for a dressy casual look.
204196,1,The shoe is light and very comfortable.It also has a sporty look.Although much of the sporty elastic gets hidden if you wear your jeans and then it looks like an ordinary shoe.But I like the comfort fit and light weight.
33304,1,"I love these shoes. I work in a place that has a professional dress code and I can't wear sneakers or shower type shoes. Recently my company instituted a fitness/walking program of 10,000 steps a day. The floors in my building are hard stone/granite and can be slippery when the humidity is high, so I needed a shoe with a rubber sole, looked professional and gave support and comfort... this shoe fit the ticket. The shoes are comfortable, very lightweight, well constructed and good value for my money. I would recommend them to anyone who walks or are on their feet a large percentage of the day.I'm thinking of getting another pair in an alternative color. I have seen these shoes in various mail order catalogs for about $10.00 more than from Amazon (and the vendor)."
226464,1,"Awesome shoes! They're the classic lo top in a modern color. Fit great, feel great, and goes with most outfits."
16147,1,This shoe is off da chain i bought this shoe when it came out. I gots the blue and white ones and they comfterable as hell they gots a spring in the sole so dat the wheel spins the only bad thing is that when you walk you hear the air from the spring but overall this shoe is off da hizzle.
295474,1,"They are affordable, easy to use and I like the color (I chose Glow). They are easy to slip on and off when walking indoors. Very useful on snow and snow covered ice. However, I didn't feel that they offered enough traction on thick, solid sheets of ice."
202410,0,"The shoe is a dark brown color; not a dark tan as depicted in the photo. I have been wearing these shoes for several years and this is the first time I bought them on line. It is not the color I was expecting. However, I will keep them anyway."
196766,1,"This I'd the first pair of candles I ever bought that was not cheap. They are amazing! Comfortable, durable, and I hope to get more like it. They maybe discontinued.. They just rock."
221749,1,"great price, good shoe, just a teeny bit tight, but maybe that's me (I've had other pairs that fit like silk), but I like it and think it's a great value."
105247,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
266124,2,"I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction."
78191,1,Good ppl had a problem with my tracking number so i emailed them and with great responce my questions were answered..
193173,1,"Fit is true to size. Was a bit leary ordering, arches are usually an issue. I am on my feet at least 10hrs a day and have no aches or pains related to wearing these shoes. Toe is just wide and round enough to be comfortable without looking odd or big."
66747,0,These are very pretty to look at but when I wore them they I didn't like the way they looked on me so I gave them away. My sister liked them.
55054,1,"I love Keds tennis shoes. Denim is very hard to find and I'm thankful Amazon is so easy to shop. No muss, no fuss. Just find the product and someone brings it to your door. I must say, though, that there should never be s&h charges on anything. Bank rates and credit card rates are getting too difficult to live with without having to considering s&h."
63782,1,"I was looking for this ones at the stores, no luck, and also, this one has a very good price!!"
330740,0,COLOR WAS NOT WAS SHOWN. NO TIME TO RETURN THEM THOUGH WE HAD TO USE THEM
275486,1,"I have a bad foot, past neuroma surgery. These boots are the most supportive, stable, comfortable things I have put on my feet in years. VERY reasonably priced, considering the comfort and quality. I just ordered the low-shoe version of these too. That is how much I like them."
195039,1,"I had been looking for navy sandals in my hard to find size for about a year. Finally found them, but decided canvas close toe shoes looked better with skirts. Service was good."
272861,1,"I've read other reviews of this shoe and they haven't been good. So I bought a pair.The shoes fit fine. They're comfortable and hold your foot. They're true to size and are supported by a kind of double strap around the ankle. If you like thin straps, don't buy them. You won't like the look. However, I found them appealingly comfortable, snug and attractive. Didn't miss the conventional vertical strap on the side at the ankle. The double strap compensates for this. They'll take a little time to work in. I wore them all day and the only issue I had was the vertical strap in the back of the foot. It dug in a little after eight hours of wear."
334701,1,So I really didn't expect to get brand new Wallabees for the price I payed. I only payed $80 and I got the exact same ones that I would've payed $150 for in store! This was absolutely great and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new pair! and not only that but i got them in about 4 days with the free shipping!
289308,1,nice product & as described .. Very comfortable .. sure will buy againThanks :)
50744,1,"Wow, I have no idea how I got such an amazing price on these. Must have been my lucky day! They arrived quickly and were packaged well. They looked fabulous with my Halloween costume and I got a lot of compliments on them. They're DEFINITELY not an everyday boot though. Keep that in mind.The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that after walking a while, I had a lot of pain in my ankles and a blister or two. Because of their material and style, they don't bend well at the ankle and the heel (not the height, but the part that the back of your foot rests against) is very rigid. Make sure you wear some thick cotton socks with these at least! By the end of the weekend, I had to wrap my ankles to wear these. Totally worth it though. They're superhot!"
342759,1,"Este producto cumple con mis espectativas,lo recomiendo a los futuros compradores, es por esto que mi calificacion a sido la maxima. Comprar por medio de Amazon es seguro y puntual..."
287842,0,"This shoe is aesthetically superior to anything on the market, particularly the latest version, a unrivaled gem which sports a navy blue faux-suede. If you don't actually want to PLAY basketball in these, definitely get a pair.However, if you're using the shoe for its intended purpose, I hope you have narrow feet and strong ankles. As a huge fan of the original T-Macs (didn't get the T-Mac 2's because they were too narrow), I was hoping that the 3's would restore my faith in the shoe. I'm a serious baller - I play just about every day and participate in 3 corporate/city leagues.That being said, after only owning these shoes for just three few weeks, I had to return them because I sprained BOTH ankles (never happened with the T-Mac 1's) AND severely bruised my medial and plantar nerves (never happened in my life - ever). Though ankle injuries are all too common in basketball, these injuries did not occur in the typical &quot;landed on someone's foot&quot; fashion, which is cause for serious concern. I consulted my podiatrist on the issue and she informed me that my shoes provided poor support and suggested I look into a pair of New Balances.Additionally, the outside of the shoe will dig into your ankle if you lace your shoes up tightly, as there is no cushioning around the top rim of the shoe.Proceed with caution - do not be wowed by looks, particularly if you need support or have wider feet."
330116,0,"I bought the size I would typically in the glass, and they are seriously tight. I would have probably gone up a half size if I had been able to try them on. I think it is fixable with a shoe stretcher, and this is just a warning."
300612,0,"These boots look very nice. The problem with them is they are made really big. I bought the size my son wears in other shoes, but these boots turned out to be quite larger than he needed. They make his feet look huge."
21581,1,"First shoes i ever ordered online and i'm happy with the purchase. Shoes are very comfortable, not stiff leather. I'm just happy to find the shoes that fit my personal style and my size!"
366587,0,"I loved my Clarks brown Muckers and I wore them a lot. But, I rather expected them to last longer than they did. I had them for less than two years before I noticed that the heels were worn down to a sponge insert. I took them to a shoe repair shop and I was told that they could not be repaired. Now I have to decide whether or not to purchase another pair."
16587,2,Not A comfortable sneaker at all! Looks like a wonam's sneaker.
380606,2,Nice looking square dancing shoes. I returned them because they were a full size too small. Also the toe box is shorter than most shoes.
90462,1,Love these shoes. The greys are perfect to go with my suit and dress. Great fit and comfortable too. The height is exactly right.
147325,1,"Purchased these for a granddaughter who loves them. Fast shipment and no problems. Good quality boots, would highly recommend them."
171338,1,"These shoes are so comfortable-it's like wearing slippers outside,and they slip on so easily but don't fall off your feet,I have numerous pairs of different colors. I only wish the soles did not have white on them-it soils easily."
349194,0,Boat shoes. Brown. Do not wear on anything slippery unless you want to fall. Somewhat comfortable but they feel very thin. I guess boat shoes are like this but i have worn other sperrys that feel better and safer.At least they look pretty good and seem well made.
207638,2,this shoes are the only one that in my life are bigger than my feet. they say 14 and the look like 16. why you make your own tyoe of shoes and not standarize sizes.
90232,1,I bought a pair of these in 1999 as work shoes; at the time I worked at a dress shop and was a teaching student. They were wonderful for commuting on the bus and student teaching. But it's been 13 years now and the shoes have seen better days. The inside is completely ruined and they have a slightly funky smell (as 13 yr old shoes often will) but they're still the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. I keep meaning to buy a new pair but never seem to get around to it. I love these shoes. Every few years I get the urge to toss them out (they're old and dirty and ripped up inside) but the moment I try them on again I remember why I haven't before. They are SOOOO comfy!!!Favorite pair of shoes EVER!
200644,1,"I've worn the classic Top-Sider's for 25 years. The local retailers want to push the higher priced versions that i have tried and do not like. They tell me that I need to move beyond them ... no thanks, i love this classic shoe!"
321334,0,"I usually wear a 7.5 but in this slipper I need an 8.5. I have slim feet, so even after I pulled the elastic strings as far as they could go, the slipper was still loose around the edges. I was hoping for a comfy slipper, instead I got an ill-fitting mess! I returned them. They might work for some, but they just weren't for me."
189681,1,"They look so pretty, hope they are available soon!"
204787,1,Bought these for my 11 and 9 yr old sons. They get Timberlands every winter but these are my favorite pair yet. The boys love them and they say they are very comfortable.
315792,1,I am new to buying online from Amazon I live in New ZealandI took what I thought was a risk buying shoes sight unseenI have been amazed at the speedy service from Amazon - only daysfor the shoes to arrive from the USThe shoes were a steal compared with prices here in New ZealandQuality is good ( not superb - but still good)the shoes fit well despite US sizing being different to ourswell done - a very happy shopper
278689,1,"I am very hard on soles and have finally worn these out after two years of hard use. These shoes do it all- look nice, keeps water out, and is the most comfortable I have ever worn. I am looking to get the exact same pair- but hard to find on sale anywhere but since the are so nice, they are worth the price."
332130,1,"Amazon is the most incredible place and I wonder what I did before they started offering products other than books, movies and CDs. I live in a small town and the only place to shop is Wal-Mart, which isn't saying much if you want nice things. So, thank you, Amazon, for doing what you do. But this review is really supposed to be about the product I ordered - in this case, the Walking Cradles sandal known as ""Jenna"". Walking Cradles are the most comfortable shoes (other than my everyday Crocs!) that I've ever worn. And that's saying a lot in my case because I have a very hard-to-fit foot. It's wide and I have an extremely high instep. But these sandals fit like a dream, which is why I now have them in every color they make. And I wear a half size smaller than I do in a regular shoe because they offer the wide width. If you ever need a well-made, comfortable shoe, go with Walking Cradles; I do!"
41189,1,I don't typically like to wear flip flops as I find them uncomfortable (no support for arches & it hurts between my toes). These however are very comfortable. This is my 2nd pair (I lost the first one) and they last forever. I'll never buy another brand.
175508,1,"I have always liked Naturalizer shoes and had some similar to the Scout in the past. I like the fact that I can adjust their tightness by moving the tab at the closing. My only difficulty is that, as yet, they are a bit stiff. However, I expect them to become more supple after wearing them for some time.Nancy Holt"
268684,1,Have worn Softspots in the past as a nursing shoe and found them to be very comfortable. This casual style is every bit as comfortable and true to size. The only drawback I could find is in the arch support. It could be a bit firmer.
60580,0,"I really wanted to like these boots, because they feel solid and comfy, but they were too small around the toes - side to side. I usually wear a 7W, so I got both 7W and 7.5W, and both were to small across the toe. I may try 8W."
158903,1,"After being associated with the 50's hipster and the 70's hippie, the 80's punk and now the millennium prepster these shoes have made the journey across time and generation. Made with a canvas material and a rubber soul these shoes stand the test of time and once thier broken in will quickly become your favorite pair of shoes . No matter the winter or the summer you'll find yourself pulling these out of the closet to pair with your jeans or your skirt. And owning one pair is never enough. A pair in every color low and high is definitly required for the true converse wearer. Buy your first pair today to emmerse yourself in a true piece of history and the future"
257302,1,"These shoes look awesome. They are a little snug at first but after a ""breaking in"" they feel really light and comfortable. Did I mention they look awesome???"
131695,0,These boots run small. I wear a 5 in women's shoes so I ordered these in a 6. They are to short my toes touch the front of the boot. I guess I will just have to see what is left in the stores where I can try them on.
303959,1,"These are great sandals! I bought some last summer and haven't been able to locate them locally, but fortunately they were available on the Internet. Love them! One of the most comfortable sandals I have found."
110082,0,"These are very nice shoes, but the site showed them available in a triplewide but what was shipped was a double wide. So, they were too small for my mother-in-law to wear. This was real frustrating because she has such a hard time finding shoes that fit and my husband spent quite a bit of time shopping on the internet. They were sure they had found an answer when they ordered these sandals. We got our refund (minus shipping) and that's all good, but we wish the shoes had been what they were represented to be in the beginning!"
112165,1,I have bought these shoes for a while now. I work on my feet 10 hours a day as a Front Desk Manager and need comfybut dressy shoes. I always keep a black and a brown pair on hand and they last at least one to two years. I never had any tear up just wore down the soles from use over time. Love these shoes!
15878,1,"I've been looking for a great looking shoe that my toddler can't take off. These are perfect. Since they're high tops, I lace them up all the way, double knot them, and I don't have to worry about him losing a shoe in the store. The only problem with Chuck Taylors are that they're somewhat difficult to put on my son's wide feet. I can tell that they're fine and comfortable once I put them on him, but I have to spend a lot of time loosening up and re-tightening the laces. I did go a size larger than my son's normal shoe size because his feet are kind of wide, and they fit perfectly. Really, you can't go wrong with Chucks."
43800,1,These shoes are the best ! I have high arches and supportive shoes are hard to find. These shoes provide excellent support and are well worth the money. I do a lot of airline travel and these shoes are perfect when going through airport security - just simply slip them off and put them on again. Great for those long trips through airport concourses. I can't recommend then enough - they're simply the best and are extremely difficult to wear out (I found a place online that can repair the soles). Treat your feet to the most comfortable shes available!
297312,1,"I ordered the beeswax colored shoe and the true color is more like the rear of the shoe in the online picture, the fade effect in the front isn't really there. I love the shoes and I can't stop getting compliments about them. They are very comfortable and run about a half size larger. Would definitely purchase again."
159254,1,These shoes look amazing. They are definitely legit Chuck Taylors. They are worth every penny.
260190,1,I love them in every color!! :) The shoes are simple and perfect! I have worn them for many years and I will continue to do so! I highly recommend these!
165003,1,"The shoes were perfect but my Mother needed a 9.5 N and the shoe came in as a 9N and I had to return it. It cost me $15.00 to return the shoe and I wanted the right size but I received the credit for the shoes only on my credit card but not for the shipping either way! So I wasn't happy and probably won't use this service again.Thanks,kathy"
12740,1,"Chuck Taylor Converse All-Star shoes are, by far, the best shoes you could ever have the pleasure of slipping your feet into each day! I own three high rise (black, pink, orange), and two low rise (green, red), and if you are in indecision about getting a pair, GET THEM! Whether you get the All-Stars or the skateboard style, you will NOT regret your decision! You can see them all at www.conversegallery.com, so check it out! These shoes are incredibly durable, and provide comfortable ankle support, making it easy to move aroung as fast as you want; you have to keep up with the shoes, not vice versa! These are basketball shoes, so they are great for running, basketball, soccer, and sport you could think of! Or, they could be just casual shoes. Another wonderful feature is that they are uni-sex, so guys and girls can wear them! Converse All-Stars RULE!"
56089,0,"Not what I wanted, but I didn't have an inside label picture of the inside label which makes a difference when buying Keds. I took a chance and from now on will look for the ""correct"" label. Not all Keds are created equal, some have more support, better fitting; this shoe isn't one of them, but for messing around in the back yard, they are okay. For long time wear, spend more."
224556,1,"A little confusing because the site clearly says Mens / Women's but the emails from the store refers to kid sizes...so I was nervous about not getting the correct size but all worked out GREAT!!!!! I would definitely recommend!!"""
217134,1,"I ordered these shoes and received them in LESS than 24 hours. I had ordered them first from Trendi USA and after 5 days they had not even shipped them yet so I cancelled and bought these from GamedaySoles and received them the next day. So I would suggest always making sure it says, Order Fulfilled by Amazon.The shoes do run a little big so I should have ordered them a 1/2 size smaller but it's not enough to return them. Just keep that in mind before you order.Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Shoes (M9166) Low top in Black"
37551,1,"It's a great looking shoe and comfy to wear, but order a half-size up. I wear 9.5 for most shoes, but I had to return the 9.5s I bought and get 10s."
238912,1,"I love these UGG boots! They feel like comfy slippers. This is the best part of winter, being able to leave the house in cozy warm UGGs. Shipping was fast, and boots are great & exactly as pictured. Thanks!!!"
16981,1,"Clear descriptions and options for purchasing. Very efficient, fast delivery and top quality goods - thank you!"
62727,1,I love my new red keds!!! They arrived right on time and are perfectly amazing!! Thanks to the great price I even ordered another color!
130368,0,"The product was great, but was not the size I expected. It did not fit the cigarettes I smoke. I will have to give it to someone as a gift,"
106156,0,I ordered shoes an got those by accident. So I wanted to send them back and I got a refund. The only irritated thing is that this company has a return form that demands that you send it back and make sure you add insurance and tracking number and they'll refund that as well when they get their shoes back. They didn't. it was only about $6 but still... you promise something - deliver.
299817,1,"Owned a pair of these sandals previously but a bad little puppy chewed one of them up. The replacements are as good as my original pair. Extremely comfortable, excellent quality, fit just right and can be worn all day without tiring the feet. There is a break in period but after that a pleasure to wear."
263841,1,"I have wore these since I was a kid, but now sadly these are hard to find. If you are looking for both quality and a product made in the states then these are the shoes for you. The nice thing is that Chucks come in a variety of colors so you can get different ones if you want to have a certain look."
117646,1,We have ordered a pair of these shoes from Amazon three times before and have been happy with their durability. This time we were able to get these in a narrow fit which have been perfect for our tall yet very thin daughter. Again we feel this was a great buy.
58924,1,"While I enjoy my 574's, and I plan to buymore pairs, they are not made in theUSA as a previous reviewer indicated. My574's say ""Made in China"" on the tongue."
190468,1,Just purchased those shoes for my brother andhe is satisfied above and beyond.A very light and comfortable feeling he told me.New Balance were and always will be the best sport shoes for me.You wan't be sorry for purchasing this particular one.5 stars !
52948,2,"I like Vaneli styles, and I own other shoes from this company, but these were unusually cheap. They were unlined! I looked at the other Vaneli shoes in my closet, and they are lined. The suede will certainly stretch out of shape very quickly without any type of lining. In addition, the heel plates are cheap, hard plastic. My experience with this type of heel plate is that it crack and even falls off. My other complaint is the excessive shipping charges. FootSmart charged me $12.99 to ship the shoes, and because I am mailing them back due to their cheap construction, they are charging me $6.99 more using the barcode return label. Thus I spent $20 to try on cheap shoes. I don't think I will buy Vaneli online anymore, and I won't order from FootSmart. Many other shoe vendors charge much less or even zero ([...]!)."
349011,1,MuCh more comfortable than they look. Everything old becomes new again. Platforms are in once more.
63771,1,Love the sneaker and it fits well and worth the money. It is comfortable and great for the summer when you are out walking for leasure.
256148,1,"What more can I say, but they are extremely comfortable slip-on shoes..I really like the brown color, the fit is true to size.. Great shoes all around.."
234682,1,"I had a pair just like this for like 10 years, but got sick of gluing the bottom back on. Granted I don't think golf shoes are supposed to last that long, and I play golf 40+ times a year usually. Anyway, these were the ones that looked as similar to the last ones I had, so I bought them. And I am very happy I did. I've tried other shoes, but they just don't have the comfort that the Nike ones seem to have. I do think a lot of it is that I wear size 15... So my options aren't as plentiful as most. Anyway, these shoes are extremely comfortable, and grip really well, and I really like the way they look. There is almost no way of me getting any golf shoe that isn't Nike ever again. These are as comfortable as my every day shoes, with exactly the performance and grip I expect out of my golf shoes. I strongly recommend these."
380296,0,"I'm normally a size 8, but the shoe was small especially around the toes. I returned it and am waiting to receive a size 8.5. However, the shoe was very sturdy, nice, and good quality."
98187,1,"I bought these slides for house slippers based on the other reviews I read. I will give one caution, you may not like them in the first few weeks. The first few times I wore them, my feet were really sore after about an hour or two. I recommend wearing them with socks for a week or so until all the nobbies soften and become more flexible. After this break-period, you'll be able to wear them any way you like and you'll love how they feel after a long day of wearing shoes."
158189,1,"I'd give them five stars but I think they're kind of ugly, not being a huge fan of the color orange. Using them for walking, about 5 miles a day, and so far they're holding up well and and are comfortable for the whole walk.Updating this review almost a year later: Still wearing these shoes, uppers still in good shape; still comfortable but about ready to be replaced, after holding up well for over 1000 miles! I'm going to try to replace them with the same shoe, I've liked them so well."
23071,0,"I like the concept of this shoe. The leopard straps are a fun, sexy look. However the base fabric is manufactured to look like raffia or rattan. Again good concept but the quality is lacking making the shoe look cheaper than it should / could. On the positive side, it is very comfortable, the padding under the ball of the foot and rounded toe make this a very wearable shoe. Also, I wear either an 8 1/2 or a 9 in heels. With naughty Monkey shoes I always take an 8 1/2. Overall this shoe is almost what I want but I returned it. There are too many shoes out there to settle for almost."
274857,1,Have been a Hi-Tec fan for many years....another good effort by this manufacturer...thank you for value delivered.
374507,1,"Have worn out 2 pair of these shoes in past years. The only thing I don't like about them, they are not made in the UNITED STATES now.. I needed them or I would not have bought them. Hope they will give me the service the others did."
228795,1,This pair of boots is very light in weight and comfortable to wear. Very good for the cold weather. Nice boots. 5 starts
330654,0,"They are rather tight for a medium width, and, although they are described as having a 1-1/2 inch heel, I measured the heel at 1/2"", the same as the Liberty Flat, which sells for $20 less. The low heel makes them less dressy than what I thought I was getting."
273717,1,"I LOVE THESE BOOTS !!! I bought them to complete a Native American outfit for a special event. But now I wear them with everything - long and short skirts, and jeans. They are soft and comfortable. They are sized correctly...I wear a 7, and bought the 7. They are fine with thin trouser socks, but if you are going to wear them during colder months, I would suggest buying a 1/2 size larger to allow room for heavier socks."
137264,1,The shoes arrived a bit earlier then they were supposed to which was nice. if you followed the chart for normal converse shoes then the size shouldnt be a problem. they are quite heavy but quite comfy. and the plastic is.... interesting shall i say. id recommend them to people just not friends
120731,1,I am horrible on Shoes. My feet are very wide and I tend to walk over most shoes I purchase. These held up well. The only problem was the soles do get worn fairly quickly.
238338,0,"Although I like these Malibu sandals, they are bigger than the Life Stride ""Milani"" sandals I bought a few years ago at Macy's. I thought I was purchasing the same shoe (they look similar)- my mistake. It appears that life Stride no longer makes the Milani style. I can wear the new ones with an orthopedic insert - but am disappointed that they are such a large size seven."
352947,1,"I really love these flats, they look really cute and are really comfy, I walked for hours and my feet didn't hurt (I have normal arch, and for me the support is great).I ordered my regular size 5 and they fit really well, just a little bit big but it is ok, when I wear thin socks this flats fit just perfect; I recommend ordering your regular size. The width is perfect (my feet are regular width).I have wore this flats only four times (for long periods of time) and I haven't had any quality issues so far, and I don't think I will because the material seems to be really nice quality."
342400,0,I like these but I bought the 8 1/2 wide and they are a little too short - but I still wear them. I will buy more grasshoppers in future but will get them in a 9 wide. I haven't worn them enough to be able to tell if they will wash easy but I expect them to.
90269,1,"Very cute boots. Works well if legs are short and thick. A lot of the other rain boots out there don't fit my 5'2"" frame and large calves. This boot runs big. I usually wear a size 7 boot, but would need a size 6 for this."
347783,1,"Although the shoes were exactly what I wanted, I think the price is considerably high for canvas-topped shoes."
113480,1,They seem to be sized a bit small as the small size does not fit my wife's size 6 shoes. She did get them to fit another pair and I will purchase a medium pair for the shoes they were originially intended for.
350130,1,"I need a dress shoes without heels due to a bad back. These shoes were sold out at the local shoe, but Amazon saved the day! A perfect fit with soft leather uppers and patent leather toe and heel, goes perfectly with pants or skirts. The very first time I purchased shoes online and it was a success!"
195326,1,"I searched all surf shops in Melbourne Australia looking for this sandal in Size 8 and was unsuccessful. Next stop the net! Woh and behold Amazon came to the rescue with the exact sandal, and 20 AUD cheaper even with postage. The service was EXCEPTIONAL to say the least. Ordered the sandals on the afternoon of February 7th with the shoes delivered on the afternoon on Friday 10th, and the sandals had travelled half way around the world! The wearer of the sandals is extremely happy."
372895,0,My 17 yr old son loved the shoe but was so disappointed how big it was. We returned it for a size smaller we r hoping this one will work.
292572,1,"I buy a new pair of these shoes every year for christmas for my wife, she seems to go through them pretty fast and i love that i can buy them off amazon in half sizes."
343045,1,"These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever purchased. They are great to wear to work and great to walk in. I am buying more shoes from Grasshoppers, forget Rockport and Easy Spirit."
207288,1,they do a really good job; fast shipping and the item was in very good condition i give them 6 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!
248789,2,Recieved two right boots. My son was never able to wear these booots since I didn't have time to return them. I was very dissapointed in the fact that I was sent two right boots instead of a pair.
278244,1,"I've always had good luck with Hi-Techs and this is one of the best. I've been breaking them in for about a week, they are stiff and you will probably need to do that. They are very well made and sturdy, and most importantly very comfortable.As to sizing they do seem to run a bit large, my 9.5 is a bit loose but I like extra room for insoles and thick socks. I have wide toes, narrow heel and high arches and that seems to be what Hi-Tech fits well. This toe box, while looking surprisingly narrow has penty of room for me, perhaps because of the loose fit.I have not walked over any slippery rocks so I cannot rate the outer sole. It is Hi-Tech's own which is to be expected, I guess, in lower price boots since Vibrams now seem reserved for $150-plus boots. I'll have to see if they are sticky enough for slippery rock scrambling."
72597,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
378926,0,"I normally wear an 8.5 (wide, if they have it) so I ordered these shoes a 1/2 size up (and wide) from other reviews suggestions. Welp...it still wasn't enough. These shoes definitely run small, and with hindsight I would have ordered a 9.5. Because it's too small, and because I'm too cheap to send them back, I will wear them anyway and just suffer a little bit from the pinching on the top side of my foot and toe box area. They are very cute though, and the heel is low enough to walk a moderate distance, but tall enough to add a little length to the legs. I took a risk by buying shoes I had never tried on before online, and it was almost a good idea."
137482,1,"Keds have always been good sneakers. These seem to have lived up to that. Since they are white, they did not wash well but I discovered if you dry them in the dryer, the streaks that show up when you air dry them disappear."
305378,1,"I've been a sales representative for over 20 years. During that time, I've probably owned more than 20 pairs of Rockport Prowalkers. The main reasons are comfort, support and durability. When I can afford it, I'll buy one pair for everyday use and one for church. When the everyday pair wears out, I'll start wearing the church pair and buy a new one.I used to buy expensive leather dress oxfords for work. I liked the way they looked, but my work shoes tend to take a beating. I was having to resole them once or twice a year. The Prowalkers are more comfortable and last longer. They're not cheap, but they're worthy the money.As long as they make them, I'll be buying them."
69013,1,"I've worn boots all my life, but never owned a set of boot trees. I know how boots can get looking really worn before their time. I bought them when I got a pair of crocodiles, and they work wonders."
381041,1,"The price is a lot lower than what I can find locally given the qualities are similar as far as I can tell. I bought them for my ballroom dance class according to recommendation from teacher.I usually wear size 6.5 or 7, this is for juniors and I read some of the reviews prior to ordering so I ordered a size 8, however it turned out to be a little big, no major problem dancing in them since the belts secure them well on my feet and these are comfy shoes. I didn't want to bother exchanging for maybe half a size smaller cuz I didn't know whether 7.5 would be too small or not, and that my class has begun.Just a piece of advise on those who are pondering on what size to buy."
198298,1,Love my chucks. This is my second pair. The blue goes with everything. I teach preschool and they are comfortable and fun to wear to work.
344542,1,"I've had over 13 pair's of eS skate shoes. Started withe the Koston one, The Creager, then the Sword. Moved up to the Accel and have been buying them since. Even the TT's are nice.The best thing about this shoe is its durability if you're a heavy skater. Don't get suede, get leather. The suede will bust on you in two weeks, the leather will last 6 months. Takes a little longer to break in, around two weeks, but worth it. The first layer on the toe lasts a long time, then there is a rubber layer which also takes forever to wear out, then ANOTHER LEATHER LAYER. Thats what makes these last so long. Amazingly stylish. P-rod and Koston both used to skate for them, reliable company.Sizing is pretty true, I run a strict 10.5 and they feel great.Credibility:12 year skateboarder, 3 ex-sponsors. I've had the Templeton 2's, Ipath, Emerica Heretics, DC's, Vans, and even Etnies. Nothing skates like this champ.My kids will be wearing these, just saying."
35885,1,"this shoes are the cutes thing ever, i buy this in black and they are perfect cuz it matches with all, and my baby are happy."
165111,1,"I ordered a size 9-10 and the shoes I got were labeled size 10. They were a little big, but I made them work. Super cute and fun shoe, my friends loved them."
341592,1,These are the most comfortable athletic mules I have ever owned. Looking to buy another pair in a different color!
265814,1,"I received my Hi-Tec Altitude boots and am very pleased. I had purchased a Hi-Tec product from a retailer some time ago and was pleased with the fit, in particular. The Altitudes are solidly made, fit very well, are comfortable and as waterproof as described. I have shopped extensively for waterproof boots for trekking through the rain, snow and slush of New York City. I walk 20-30 blocks a day in these and they perform very well. I have been unable to find a similar pair of boots at this price anywhere I have shopped. I recommend these highly."
95103,1,"I have very flat feet and have to put arch support in my shoes or else I'm in a lot of pain. After much searching and trying different brands, these are all I wear now. Theywear very good and stay nice looking."
281927,2,"The sandal is good for the normal male's foot. My son has a very thick foot and the toe thong and the straps were very, very tight."
61589,1,"Pros:Came BEFORE they said it was going to be deliveredQuality is greatCons:Beware of the size you get... I got the 8.5A and I didn't realized A meant narrow and when I say narrow, I mean VERY NARROW! Thank god my feet are very narrow or they would be too small!Great product overall! (:"
172349,1,"Super stylish and comfortable. Great choice for traveling and going through TSA security checkpoints at the airport. Easy slip on and off. I own these in both black and brown. Love them, but unfortunately, I can only rate these shoes 4 out of 5 stars because I stand on my feet all day at work. I started a new job about a year ago which requires standing all day. These shoes were well broken in long before then. At the end of the first day in which I wore these to work, my feet were killing me. I will still wear them, but only for travel and during off time."
190842,1,"This shoe was superb when I used it for my highschool football team. I was able to run my fastest and not feel dragged down by a pound of lead, with out the high cut ankle support I was able to cut faster and throw off almost all of my defenders. This shoe really did enhance my perfromance. Ideal for wide receivers and running backs."
389706,1,i had a converse b4 but it was getting really old so i decided to buy a new one. it was just as i wanted it to be. its sure NOT to disappoint.
284927,1,"Awesome Buy! I Love The Shoes, And Really Want Another Pair! I Will Definately Be Buying Again From Amazon.com. Very Very Happy With The Shoes. :)"
254347,0,"I have recived the converse shoe yesterday.. opened the box and took a close look at them, really do not like the finish and they really do not look original to me. i am thinking of returnig them"
259861,1,"my son bought these with his own money and we were disappionted to find out the sizes run very large. Wasn't made very well, sides began falling apart. Wouldn't buy this one again. Did arrive quickly."
227640,1,I was extremely satisfied. The shipping was BEYOND fast! I got my shoes the next day.My husband has some old blue ones and I wanted to get him ones in black. I checked for his shoe size for Chuck's (since they tend to be a size or a size and a half longer then the normal shoe size).
147017,1,"Very happy with the product and delivery was fast and as expected based on the delivery option chosen. I bought these for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she loves them. They fit perfectly, but I would highly recommend purchasing the UGG care kit also - especially if you are purchasing the lighter colored UGGs. The care kit is inexpensive at approx. $20.00."
355555,1,"I love ASICS...I've been using these twice a week for over 3 years now. They're still functional (i.e. no holes, loose sole, etc.)."
112914,1,The skin is really soft.The shoes look better than in the picture.The color Carmel looks amazing on my mom's feet.
323866,0,"I should have ordered this as a size 12 or 11 1/2 if available but I still likeed the shoe and still have them for around the house lounging around but not good for any strenuous sport because of snug because of size, not the shoe."
260179,1,"a few minutes at the computer with teenager, a couple of days latter=happiness! Thank you,"
205781,1,I will buy them again because they're so good. I love them. They fit and look great and are very comfortable. I just wish that I had purchased my correct size...It would be helpful if the company just resizes these according to street shoe sizes.
357472,1,"VENDEDOR RESPONSABLE, EL ARTICULO ESPERADO EN PERFECTO ESTADO, NUEVO SIN INCONVENIENTES. PRODUCTO QUE RECOMIENDO COMPRAR. TAL COMO LAS ESPERABA. VERY GOOD!"

318986,1,"very good shoe, if you want something other then sneakers, comfort is great for walking or standing. had no problems with the order or shipment, price was ok also."
187907,1,"Love product. Quick service. Misled by color ""sport white."" Assumed it was WHITE, turned out to be TANISH color. Had to keep as needed immediately. Otherwise, mostly happy."
15772,1,"My son was thrilled to find these Tims at this unbelievably low price. Amazon shipping was prompt as always, and the fit was perfect."
73951,1,"Very good product, quality and finish.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .."
329909,1,"For whatever reason I have always had trouble finding shoes that really made my feet comfortable. A few years back, after doing some research, I discovered the New Balance M1122MC (The single M is for ""Men"", the MC is for ""Motion Control""). I have been wearing this shoe, and its previous incarnations, for several years now and without a doubt this is the best shoe I have ever worn. It's is built around what New Balance calls an SL-2 last (or ""mold"") and and the extra room that this gives my foot in the toe box makes all the difference in the world. With out a doubt this is my Number 1 choice in shoes!"
147302,1,"The shipping is on time, and the product is very nice which was not what I expected before as this pair of uggs were selling at a discounted price (I thought it might have some defectivenesses), great deal!"
184277,1,Originally I purchased these shoes to wear while working in my overnight job in a call center.....they were so comfortable I now wear them all the time!UPDATE-I lst the original pair while moving to a new location and HAD to buy another pair!
243300,1,"Love these shoes! Have been wearing them all my life and still think they are the best! Great price and super fast shipping! Couldn't,t be happier!"
10281,1,After looking for a long time we were able to find the boots we were looking for. thanks again!!
26011,1,"The 990 Serries New Balance are some of the best shoes availible. After standing on concrete floor for 8 to 10 hours per day, I found other brands looked great, but were uncomfortable after 3 or 4 months. The New Balance shoes lasted twice as long and cost about the same price as the Nike and other brands I had previously purchased. I've bought nothing but New Balance ever since - for over 10 years now. Beside the durablity and the correct size avalibility, I find wearing shoes made in the USA rather than Korea or China a major plus!"
348922,1,Love the shoe! It's kinda retro but it feels great. Exceeds my expectations. What more can I say? It's a Reebok!
60500,0,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
228035,0,"As i say i bought it for a friend and he says that is great. He wasn't wait too long for it (thanks!). He got a RDV with girl, he planned to wear it at the rendez-vous. He was worry thinking will he get it at time."
67236,0,"I purchased my first pair of these colorful classic sneakers several years ago, at a local 'brand name' discount store. To be honest, they initially caught my eye because of their vibrant color. Once I tried them on, they felt so wonderful, that I knew from that very moment, that I would wear them until they literally fell off my feet. They had such fantastic cushioning, with arch support, a cut above the highest standard. These are the only shoes I have ever owned that did NOT require additional supportive inserts.The sad day came, when I had to delegate my foot savers to the trash. I wasn't too upset, because I figured they would never discontinue such a wonderful product. I was wrong. No one seemed to carry them. Disgruntled in my search, I gave up looking the last couple of years, only to stumble on them by complete accident, on Amazon. When I found them again, I was ecstatic. Not only were they old favorites, but I work as an RN, and we have recently been required to wear only navy blue scrubs. A perfect match!The shoes arrived and I was not disappointed in their appearance. They are still striking and fun to look at. But, as other reviewers have noted, the foot-bed is not the same. They definitely do not have the same degree of cushioning, and the arch support is minimal, at best. So, I did have to resort to orthotic inserts, this time, before I could even wear them. But, after doing so, they were brought up to almost the same degree of comfort as my first pair. But, not quite!I normally wear an 8 1/2 but sized up to a 9 because some reviewers felt this new version runs a little small. I didn't find this to be true. Even with an additional insert, this shoe is a little looser than I like, requiring some pretty tight lacing, or a thicker sock. I think most would do well to just order their regular size.I'm disappointed that they have, in my opinion, cheapened this wonderful shoe. But, that does seem to be the sign of the times, doesn't it."
288919,1,"Love the shoe, Won't buy from Champs in the future. The return process is painfully SLOW."
327821,1,"first of all, i am a big soccer fan and i have been playing the sport for more than 12 years, i play at least 3 times a week so i have tried aloooooooooooot of shoes,dont bother by the nike crab ( except for the talaria model for its light weight 7 lb ! ) ... this addidas shoe is really great, gives you great grib on the ball thanks to the leather exterior and curivng of the side. when you try it you might find it heavy so give it time (two games max) and you will see . great heel support and for the fashon lovers its nice looking."
87430,1,my husband wears his slippers when he goes out he loves them so much
172999,1,"These shoes are very pretty, but after a little use, the front part of it started to fall apart. I thought that it was too expensive for them to wear out so soon. But again, they're very pretty."
294124,1,"Bought as a gift for my son. They were true to fit size, comfortable and a very good price."
384519,1,"I am delighted with this product. previously bought addias trainers,but found these are lite, hard wearing and very comfortable . After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented "" Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their "" . which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man. EXCELLLANT PRODUCT."
183265,1,"The boots are comfortable and easy to wear. Are not heavy, which was the main reason I was looking to replace my other pair. The boots are durable and appropriate for the snowy winter in Boston. Water does not penetrate them at the bottom. Nice buy!"
86874,1,"I wore out my first pair after 2 years. I have to have these in my shoe rack, have alot of other more expensive shoes but these are far and away my favorite!"
321514,1,I purchased these and loved that they came almost immediately. The moccasin fits true to size as do all of my Minnetonka shoes. The color is great and the moccasin is so comfortable. I love this brand and will order more inthe future.
373591,0,"My husband, wearing a size 9, could not get his foot inside this slipper. Will probably have to return and try a larger size."
250101,1,"Well, what more can I say? They are nice shoes for the dress blues... I had trouble finding the ones I could manually polish, but these work... Just make sure not to scuff them... Because for the most part, scuffs do not come out... Cleaning them is simple and can be done with windex. The shipping was also quick, faster than Vanguard's second day, even though I did standard shipping with these... But they get the job done..."
334705,1,"I ordered the Beeswax Wallabee Boot as a gift for my boyfriend. They arrived in perfect condition and looked exactly like the picture. I was apprehensive about ordering a whole size smaller (10 instead of 11), but I followed everyone's suggestion and they fit him perfectly. He absolutely loves them and I could not be more pleased!One thing to note: Do not get these confused with the PADMORE WALLABEES. These are Clarks ORIGINALS and are more of a full boot than the Padmore (which sits lower on the ankle). They are a bit pricier but well worth the money!!!!!!Definitely buying again."
121115,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
219536,1,"This is the only shoe that I could find with a sole that doesn't cake up with mud (to be released bit-by-bit around the house). They are not as comfortable as some that I've had, but they are very well made."
141861,1,"I recently bought a pair of these truly amazing shoes, it is impressive looking and has a snug fit ensuring complete support. I am an athlete and this shoe is one of the best running shoes I have ever come across. I love these shoes and would really recommend them to anybody active."
365154,1,"I knew what I was buying, it was an OK price and it arrived, new, clean and on time. Been wearing them for 50 years."
132318,0,"The size runs small. My daughter wears a size 6 in shoes so I ordered a 6 in this shoe too, however it was way too small. Couldn't even get on her foot. It seems a 6 in this shoe is equivalent to her other size 4 shoes.The quality seems good though if you how their sizes run."
268831,1,Before I had a lumbar laminectomy in 2003 I volunteered to teat a pair of Rockport ProWalkers. Since my apinal surgery every shoe that I had resulted in my right sole slapping down on the pavement. Recently I took my Rockport ProWalkers out of the closet and to my wonder walking with them did not result in foot drop. There must be something in the design or construction of the sole of the shoe that prevents my foot from slapping down on the pavement. Most of the labeling identification has worn off the shoes so I can't find a model number. I would like to replace my old Rockport ProWalkers with a newer shoe if I can locate the model number.
149377,1,"I received the product in perfect condition as it indicated the seller, I recommend it 100%, it has worked very well! I use it a lot to even go to college, parties, and many other things, as it is very useful in every way!"
180620,1,"These Chucks are top of the line, very comfortable, still rocking my cons five years strong, the great thing is you can walk in these cons all day with no discomfort or pain. GET THEM!"
244108,1,Great product!I'll highly recommend.My only comment: it has not the inside flower design as shown in the photo
260211,1,"Because I live in the city, I do not have time or transportation to get items such as these. It was so convenient and I saved a little $$$!"
135481,1,I got them today around the time they said they would be here. The shoes were in great condition inside the box and they were just what I expected to be. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I would order from them again.
265963,1,Its a nice shoe... it beats the shoes I had been wearing before. I got the wide version since my feet are a bit wide. I don't like how shoes get narrow at the tip. They need to make some wide toed hiking shoes.
239221,1,"I bought this shoe several years ago for my father(now 79 years old), he wore them out, so I bought him a replacement pair. He has a lot of swelling in his ankles and lower legs due to poor circulation, and these are easy to get on and off. This year I bought a size bigger so he could get in his orthotics. He likes them because they are not so ""geriatric"" looking, and they are comfortable. He was excited to receive his new pair!"
318368,1,"A happy manThe first day of wearing the hush puppies I found them a bit stiff,I Thought oh no I have scuffed the soles and now I am committedTo the ownership of these shoes . However from the second dayon they are proofing to be exactly what I expected from this brandof (hush puppy) shoe. Again I am a happy man"
202844,1,"Great product. Love the way it holds the feet (snug). Only draw back is that it makes my feet sweat on hot days, my feet never sweat in other shoes. Better as a fall shoe than summer."
164929,1,These shoes are extremely comfortable. I have several pairs in different colors and wear them all the time.
122735,1,This shoe is comfortable right out of the box and every pair is consistantly good....this is my 8th pair. The sizing is right on the numbers. They make a good walking shoe for desert trails with good support and insulation from the heat of the summer sun on hot sand or pavement.
282917,1,"Once you break these shoes in, you'll find they're really comfortable! I'm constantly walking around for work, so it's important to have a reliable shoe. This is one of the best!"
160651,1,"THIS SHOES I AM USING TO MY WORK, MY HOUSE, TO GO TO UNIVRSITY AND TO ALL.I AM FROM DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND I KNOW THAT CONVERSE HAS SUPPERED MY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SHOES, I RECOMENDED YOU THAT BUY IT THIS BRAND BECAUSE IT THE BETTER AND IT IS BEATIFUL"
385498,0,"I really liked this footwear at first - style and comfort were a plus. However, upon wearing them for awhile, they have little raised bumps on the inside floor of the shoe where the flat of your foot walks and they get very irritating and uncomfortable after awhile. I'm sure they were meant to ""massage"" or something but they have the opposite effect."
274037,1,"I bought these for my 10 year old son. He absolutely loved them. DC's tend to run small, but I knew this in advance and purchased a half size bigger. They fit perfectly."
147768,1,These boots are surprisingly lightweight...they are SO comfy and I wear them constantly! I love them! Especially with the top folded down to show the fur!
213256,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
88883,1,"I really like these, but... they are a little too &#34;funky&#34; for an everyday staple, I just didnt look at the picture close enough to see the slight dip in the heel. I like them, and I'm sure I'll wear them plenty but they likely wont go with as many things as I'd hoped. They do look a little &#34;plastic&#34; and I kind of felt like Frankenstein when I first put them on, they are clunky,heavy. As other reviewers said, my toes do slide down a little further than I'd prefer. Again, I will wear them, I do like them, but I will continue to look for something very much like them just not as edgy :)"
333476,0,"These are beautiful penny loafers. However, they run narrow and short. The pair I ordered were 10 E. They were at least 1/2 size short and I wear an E (wide) and narrow. I had to return them and am nervous about reordering them to get the sizing correct. So I just went elsewhere.Otherwise they are nicely made and I'd wear them regularly - - if I could get them to fit."
288606,1,This is my second pair of these. I love them. They are great brand new and even better worn in.
201725,1,absolutely love the shoes! so gorgeous. plenty of toe room which is usually always where it hurts in most dressy sandals.and amazon has lightning fast shipping.i recommend this buy to everyone...its beautiful.
9071,1,Product arrived as promised and in good condition. Great shoes for around the house without the weight of the heavy athletic shoes.
1601,1,"Certainly the best pair of hiking shoes I've ever had (I haven't had too many).The shoes are perfect for what they were made, they really are waterproof, they are quite comfortable, reliable and look nice.Points to improve: waterproofing, for showing your friends it's ok, but for real hiking... well, it can be improved."
26710,1,"A+++++++ for beauty and comfort. I can wear this shoe for hours and literally have with no discomfort. Plus it is very cute and can be worn with either a pant or dress. Buy it ! You won't regret it. ****Note: This shoe runs true to size so no need to go up 1/2 a size, buy your actual size."
300488,1,"Exactly what I ordered and fit great. Im not sure if they are really waterproof, but i bought them to walk on rocks in Afghanistan and they work great for that."
2714,1,I have been using Shoe Goo for years to extend the life of expensive running shoes.It just works! ...and the price is right!
101744,0,"I had read the reviews to order bigger, because they run small, so I did. I ordered a full size larger, and they were still too small. I also ordered narrow, and they weren't very narrow. I had to send them back, and did not order a different size, because I didn't get the full refund. Very cute, but not worth it."
90585,1,These are beautiful shoes at a great price. They also arrived very fast! I am extremely happy with my purchase.
124645,0,"Wasn't sure how to rate these. They're a really nice, high quality shoe but had to return them because they were too short. Definitely would've kept them if they had fit. Ended up buying something locally rather than returning for a bigger size."
3668,1,"I have owned over 8 pairs of these boots.They are well made,comfortable to wear as soon as they are taken out of the box and waterproof.They fit true to size.I highly recommend them to anyone that wants a great boot at a great value."
151029,1,"Have had these for three years now, and they have been great the whole time. I wear them almost daily. They are so comfortable!!! Definitely going to New Balance for my other needs as well."
270267,1,I love this business casual walking shoe. Its my everyday wear shoe for work and it lasts me for couple of years. Extremely comfortable and a great product bu Rockport. Also Amazon prices are amazing for this shoe .. much better than buying from the B&M stores.
296674,1,This is my favorite sandal. I highly recommend this product for everyday summer outings and vacations. Walking is a breeze in these Breeze Walkers.
100298,1,"I originally got a matte-finish pair about four years ago from another website the name of which I can't even remember. I wore them constantly and after three years they were showing it. I searched Amazon and lo and behold these came up--identical except for the finish (I did prefer matte but couldn't find it here). These are extremely easy to walk in because the platform means your foot is really not under stress, and the heel, while high, is sturdy. Every time I wear them, with is pretty much every day except on weekends, I get told how awesome they are. I even wear them to work. They are just the right mary jane look with the height to make them sexy. The only thing I don't like is that the shiny finish means you have to be careful not to scuff them--but I learned that the hard way with the old pair, so I am with these. I've had them almost a year and only managed to get a small scuff on them, and like I said I wear them virtually daily. Oh yes--I ordered my size, 7, and they fit fine."
263195,1,Very happy with these sneakers. Look great and feel comfortable. Want to buy another pair!!
253970,1,I looked all over for these shoes found them at a great price and love them so much and will buy another pair very soon as these ones are almost destroyed
257769,1,very comfortable and keep my feet very warm. I would recommend this product to a friend. wow I am not sure what else to say to complete th amount of words.
315201,0,"good quality of the product, but sizes are not as usual. My daughter is a size 13US and I ordered 13.5 and it is approx. 2 sizes smaller than I need!!!"
27872,1,"My first experience with Saucony were a beat up pair my mother used to run marathons in, during the late 70's. I took them because they were easy to slip on and off when I was at swim meets. The main thing I noticed was that they supported my arch. Which if you have arches that a little higher than normal these shoes solved my problem.I then bought a second pair of dark blue which were my constant companions during my last three years of high school. I wore them for gym, practice for several sportsThe summer before my freshman year at college I managed to find a pair of light purple and bought those. They have lasted me through walking through my quad, relay for life and when I have to walk a mile to the train each night after school.So it was a no brainer to bring them along when I went overseas. This is after three years of wear and tear. But I could not afford another pair. So I walked in them along roads, running for buses, ran on a beach, waded into the ocean and even climbed a mountain in them. Yes I got tired but my feet never got blisters nor did my arches feel like they were breaking in half slowly. Plus they dry really quickly.I wondered if maybe they needed to be retired after everything I put them through.I was wrong they still were fine to be worn. As our my other two pairs.I love these shoes."
224014,1,just an FYI - these things wear a size smaller than what you normally wear (i.e. i wear a 9M and ordered an 8M that fit perfectly)
238434,1,My son picked these out for wrestling this year. He is a junior in high school. He was pleased with the shoe itself and I was especially pleased with the sale price and the quick service that we got ordering the shoes and receiving them almost immediately! Great to order things from Amazon!!!
387974,1,"Bought these for my wife, and now it is all she wears. Well worth the price. Highly recommend."
298829,1,"Great for camping, fishing and boating. Easy to slip on for those late-night trips to campsite restroom."
174163,2,The shoes were not clearly identified as narrow width. they were way too tight. I gave them to a friend.
56515,0,... you know the aggravation when you get a pair of shoes that make your socks slip down at the heel ...
211115,0,"I bought this shoe as an ""everyday"" work shoe. It's a good fit and moderate length heel that is very comfortable. My only complaint is that the inner layer of the shoe that your foot rests on has already come loose causing my foot to slide in the shoe."
210279,1,"I'm surprised how comfortable these shoes are, and they fit. I have a problem with some high heeled shoes slipping off my back heel... Not easy to walk with your heel slipping out of the shoe! These don't do that plus, without breaking them in they are comfortable. I love the style too, and they'll go with most everything."
302659,1,The product was in excellent shape. Size did not fit daughter. Reordering. Thank you for great services.
204306,0,"I ordered these for my 8 year old son. He was so excited he took them out of the box and tried to put them on only to discover that we were sent two left shoes. Now I am stuck with two left feet. Need to order a second pair, they say only one pair left in his size 4.5, must be two right shoes."
94698,1,"Just got this shoe and it's very comfortable, but it's narrower than I expected. I got a medium, as usual, but it's too tight (even without strapping them closed) so a wide would have been better. I'm hoping it will stretch."
220268,1,"I'm a 30+ year union electrician working in construction, and tough job site conditions require a solid pair of protective sure grip boots.I just received my new boots and have to say that the quality appears to be outstanding. I have been wearing Red Wings for decades but decided not to continue due to a tighter budget and Plantar Fac. diagnosis. I could not take the break in necessary without being crippled.These are more comfortable out of the box than my 2.5 year old Red wings ever were. Rock solid stability and great comfort features. Electrical rated and steel toe protection.A great looking pair, Made In The USA by Union craftsman,at less than half the price of Red Wings.Barring problems down the road, I am from now on a Thorogood man.union Yes!"
360695,1,"This is a fabulous running shoe, good for high mileage in tremendous comfort. Lots of stability. I actually use it mostly offroad trailrunning (prefer this over trail-running shoes) but trailrunning does take a toll. Good for 400 miles."
84330,1,"Ordered these Crocs for my husband who is deployed to Afghanistan. He loves them. They use them as ""shower shoes."""
133732,1,My daughter is 3 and wears size 8 shoes. I read all the reviews on this product and decided to order her a 9 and it fit her perfectly! I hope this helps other moms!
338181,1,"I bought these shoes a few years ago for walking around, but didn't wear them much because of how uncomfortable they are for long walks and/or running.However, I've found that these shoes make excellent and inexpensive shoes for weight lifting, especially during squats, as well as for heavy bag work when boxing. These shoes have very little cushioning other than the hard rubber soles, but this gives you an excellent and stable plant so that your can perform squats with much better traction and balance than in heavily cushioned running shoes.The material of the outsole, the bottom of the shoe, is such that it gives you traction when you need it, can be easily avoided when you don't. My feet are squarely planted for squats, lunges, and heavy lifting - they don't slide. They plant well, and I get good form.However, when I'm doing heavy bag work, they are extremely easy to pivot in and let me easily pivot my feet and hips to delivery quick and strong punches and round house kicks to heavy bags - a much better feeling than even going barefoot, unless I were to use a lot of talcum powder on my feet."
309462,1,I love these sandals! They provide a lot of support yet don't look like old lady shoes. I'd highly recommend them.
226468,1,"Very Fast! I had the item within 2 days of placing the order, color and size correct. I was very pleased with the service."
377582,1,These slippers are constructed so sturdily that they seem much more like a regular shoe. The sole doesn't really flex at all. The inside is very fuzzy and soft like a slipper. They are very well constructed and they are made of quality materials.
348791,1,"I purchased these boots for my son Jake for Christmas. They came really fast and were exactly what I ordered so I was very happy. Also, the price was $20 less than anywhere else I had looked, and there were a lot of places. Thanks!"
321921,1,These shoes last for SO long and fit great. The color is perfect and they are wonderful to dance in.
106922,1,Just what I was looking for and for the right price. I got them exactly when they said I would.
153997,2,"I have had Uggs before and loved them. The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs. However, these black uggs are a big disappointment. The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty. Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone. I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown. My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there's never bled the black color onto their feet. Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would've returned them."
334169,1,"Got these for x-mas and these are one of the most comfortable shoes I own. Put them on to shop the day after x-mas sales and was in them for 11 hrs, felt like walking in some comfy house shoes. Don't hesitate get'em."
357662,1,"very sturdy, warm boot, can feel the warmth instantly as soon as I put them on.true to size.the look of the boot is casual, high shaft.they are made in Canada with good quality."
224009,1,"I ordered these shoes and received them in LESS than 24 hours. I had ordered them first from Trendi USA and after 5 days they had not even shipped them yet so I cancelled and bought these from GamedaySoles and received them the next day. So I would suggest always making sure it says, Order Fulfilled by Amazon.The shoes do run a little big so I should have ordered them a 1/2 size smaller but it's not enough to return them. Just keep that in mind before you order.Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Shoes (M9166) Low top in Black"
132514,1,The ballet shoes are beautiful however they are not true to size they run small. I unfortunatley threw out the receipt and my daughter ripped the box they hard to get on her feet so I will definetely have to order a bigger size but I would defintely recommend.
231688,1,"I've always been the weirdo who hated flipflops despite their enormous popularity. I hated seeing all the hundreds of cute styles that I just couldn't wear because they went between my toes and it made me so uncomfortable that I couldn't stand it. This is the first flip flop I've ever bought and now I wear it basically every day. I've gone back and bought more pairs and would pay twice what they are listed and still be super happy. They aren't just a flipflop I can wear... they are truly the single most comfortable shoe I've ever worn IN MY LIFE! They have a bit of arch-support, the cute criss-cross straps provide support spread across the foot so it isn't all pulling between the toes, and the shoe itself is super-squishy. I am totally in love with this shoe!!!"
66696,1,Very good product. My sister is happy with them. I recommend other women to try.
372477,1,"The black Chuck Taylor's are a must have classic for the shoe lover. I own two pairs of them myself, and would never buy anyother shoe. Why? They're so comfortable and match EVERYTHING!"
155716,1,"Initially the item was not delivered to the requested address; since the seller is using the USPS, which is not as efficient as UPS or DHL; however the seller made all efforts to track the item and finally was located in some post office and I have to go my self and collect it.For deliveries, I would suggest to the seller, to use UPS or DHL even if you charge the client the additional cost."
162735,1,"These shoes are very pretty and they didn't hurt my feet at all after wearing them for 6 hours at a holiday dance. I purchased them in black and they'll be versatile enough to wear for formal or everyday occasions. They are well made and I feel that I got them at a bargain price, especially with the $20 discount offer. I am debating on buying another pair in a different color."
124625,2,"I was excited to get these flats and I had outfits already planned for their arrival. When I opened the box I found them to be of the cheapest quality material, and the metallic paint was SPRAYPAINTED on!! It flaked off the second that I took them out of the box and made a mess on my table. The toes and bow were already scratched up from the shipping, and that was inside of a box so just imagine what one day of wearing them would do! I am returning them today and getting a full refund.These shoes are cute in the picture, but don't be fooled, they are of the worst quality! Dont waste your money."
283866,1,I have been wearing this sandal for several years. They are so comfortable and last forever! I love them and have them in different colors.
60819,0,"I have only had these shoes for a short time and maybem they need to br broke in a little, but the arch area is a little uncomfortable."
75205,1,These shoes are light weight for runnung or in my case work and seems to be built pretty sturdy. One caution is these shoes are not that good on wet surfaces and ice Im sure. you slide pretty easy
341972,1,Enzo most comfortable shoes. Have been wearing them for years. I highly recommend them to all who want a comfortable shoe.
241317,1,"I got mine from a Converse store in a mall near St Louis for $20. I've had them for 2 and a half years and have worn them everywhere. I ran a 10 minute Mile and a half in them twice for my Air Force PT Test. I've worn them in Iraq, Kuwait, Arizona, Florida, Washington. they are a part of me. Truly an epic shoe. They're also a great driving shoe, with a nice rolled heel after some wear, and great pedal feel. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice all around, everyday shoe."
223476,1,"thank you eastbay for sending to me this beatiful leather trainers that is new balance men's 574 leather New Balance Men's 574 Leather ( sz. 09.5, Brown/Tan/White : leather )although i was expecting it sooner than schedle time but stil it came at your stipulated time thank you very much.please allow other product to be ship to my region like cell phone camcorders e.t.c thank you."
165966,1,"I've always liked LifeStride shoes. These are very comfortable and they look good. I'll definitely buy a pair again, soon."
377259,1,I still don't know if these boots are worth the money paid...but they are definitely the best pair of boots that I have owned. You won't be disappointed other than void you will feel in your checking account.
79431,1,"I love my Converse shoes. I know my size and I know that they will fit. Needless to say, when the shoes arrived they were in great condition! They fit. No problems and no need for a return or exchange."
289547,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
54942,1,"I wore my old black ones out and the navy were a great deal (under $20). Super comfortable, exactly what I expected."
121583,1,"Every spring, I bought flip-flops. After a while, they squished down, and my back would start to hurt. I asked myself, why are there not good quality sandles on the market? Well, I asked around and got good comments on Reef sandles, so I took the plunge, spent the extra money, and I am so happy now. I'm embarrassed to say that I weigh close to 400 pounds. Long story, etc... but, after 4 months of use, these Reef sandles look like new! I expect to get at least 2 years out of them. Hey, spend $5 on flip flops and throw them out in September. Or buy quality and enjoy them for years. The bottle opener has come in handy too!"
23661,1,Ordered these for the man friend and I got a great deal during the Amazon sandal sale. Arrived quickly and was exactly what I was looking for. If you haven't tried these on I highly recommend buying some. Reef sandals are amazing and these are no different. Great for men and women.
62522,1,The Keds are fine. I have had them for a few days now and they are great. No complaints at all.
3271,1,These arrived quickly fit great and are very comfortable. I bought these for general use during colder months to replace sneakers.
118077,1,"These shoes were a birthday present for my 4yo. Based on reviews, I decided to buy one shoe size up from her current shoe size to be safe. She went up a size right before her birthday and they fit perfect. They match street shoe size as recommended. Great shoes at a great price!"
77100,1,"We ordered these boots last year for our then 2 yr. old for Christmas and now 1 year later, they are still his favorite boots. (I ordered them a couple of sizes too big.) He has always been able to put them on by himself (sometimes on the wrong foot) but nonetheless, he is ready to go in seconds ! He has gotten them wet several times and been generally pretty rough on them and they have held up beautifully. We couldn't be more pleased. He has gotten more use out of these boots than anything he has owned. Perfect for Cowboy dress-up, birthday parties to ride the pony, etc... We had no problems with shipping from Western Warehouse. You should be very pleased with this purchase."
251775,1,"I received good customer service with the company that sells these boots. Ariat is a good quality boot, you have to have more than one pair of these."
247034,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
158722,1,These shoes are great! I had a pair already and wanted a spare...could not find them locally but found them on Amazon.Amazon has almost everything I want and provides great service as well!
323845,0,"Sandals look good, but they run one and a half sizes too small; and a bit narrow."
324042,1,"Nice shoes, very classy, and so comfy! I wore them as a bridesmaid in my sister's wedding and was comfortable for hours...and I was 9 months pregnant at the time. Try a pair, you won't regret it."
183655,1,"These shoes are incredibly light and wearing them after wearing construction shoes all day, make you want to run ! The material does not seem very strong but I guess all light weight shoes are like that. The sizing is a little screwed up. Size 10 is really size 9.5. So buy 0.5 sizes up. But You can still fit into ""your"" size and the shoes easily expand.The only annoying thing I found is that the footprint is so small that it feels like your feet are touching the ground at an angle. Maybe this is the right way to be running .. I dont know. I have run about 10 miles with these shoes so far and they seem to be adjusting ... so maybe after a few more weeks, I will get better used to having my feet touch the ground with these shoes. I am just used to shoes that touch the ground flat and your feet inside the shoes cannot rock them back and forth sideways ... but I guess a shoe this light and contoured does allow extreme flexibility and I am just not used to that.And note that while they provide very good grip on all sorts of wet and gainy pavement, they dont provide very much support at all so I can see a lot of potential ankle twists if you run with them ""out back"" like the name suggests. The small foot print I think will easily let your foot pivot in unnatural ways on loose soil.On tar and concrete though, they are excellent. An excellent and light running shoe. Just the sizing is screwed up and has a very bounded footprint."
121837,1,"Very comfortable product, muy husband really enjoyed it and resulted exactly as expected, it is a very light sandal, and a high quality product."
4264,1,"I have wide feet and somewhat high arches, which has made finding really good shoes for general wear somewhat difficult. And for that reason, I have stuck with New Balance shoes since my undergraduate days. They are well made, and have versions designed for various activities, including running, cross-training, and walking. And very importantly, they come in widths other than ""medium,"" and provide the maximum benefit to my feet.Recently on a trip to western North Carolina, I went hiking with a group of friends from the area. I soon found that my best New Balance shoes were not up to the task: the terrain soon overwhelmed them, and as the day went on, their ability to support my 200 lb. body failed. By the end of the day, my feet hurt so bad that I could barely walk. I was told that I absolutely needed to find a good pair of hiking boots if I was going to continue hiking.I am one of those people who first do a lot of research before I make a new purchase, comparing features, price, availability, technical reviews, and feedback from those who have already made their choice. In the price range I was looking for, the signs all pointed to Hi-Tech. Lots of folks carried them, but Amazon's price was clearly the best. And so, tentatively, I ordered a pair.I have now been wearing these boots for three months, and I have yet to put my New Balance back on for everyday use. I still wear business shoes to work, and the New Balance to run in, but the Hi-Tech Altitude IVs are absolutely my favorite. Why?1. The fit was perfect from the first time I put them on. In fact, I would have to say my feet felt better in them almost immediately. The width was exactly as I needed, and the arch was just high enough to give me full support for a full day and still enable me to do everything I need.2. They needed no ""break-in period"" and felt right from the first time I wore them. Even the desert boots I wore in the Middle East needed some period to adjust to my feet and to the way I walk, and the steel-toed work boots I bought from Wal-Mart still hurt my feet (after occasional wear for over a year). But these feel like an extension of my feet and skin.3. They are waterproof, yet still allow my feet to breathe. Even my kids no longer run out of the room when I take my boots off (which used to be a regular joke around my house).4. They seem to be wearing like iron. After three months, I cannot see any wear at all, not even negligible amounts. So I won't be buying another pair for a while.All in all, these boots have my STRONGEST recommendation. You may find more costly boots, but I challenge you to find any that are significantly better."
161493,1,"It's the first time when I bought this type of shoe, but I'm telling you, I love it; comfortable, cool, nice, I can't take eyes off them; Yes I'm talking about ""CONVERSE"" by Chuck Taylor, baby."
342117,1,"WTSHTF, I want to be wearing a comfortable, durable, and skid-resistant pair of boots. I did a lot of research, and I came to the conclusion that these boots were my best bet. They do take a little breaking in, but I like the look and feel of them to take me through the toughest foot paths of the Apocalypse...;)"
217001,1,These shoes are great they look nice too! The only thing is that they don't have great arch support so I suggest getting some Dr Scholls Insoles.
383460,0,"This shoe looks great with various outfits, including shorts, skirts & capris. Not true to size. I ordered a 7W but shoe fits like a medium width. Very rare for LifeStride shoes, most wide widths fit perfectly."
180726,1,My teenager loves these Chuck Taylor's and he is so happy that he received them for his Christmas present.He says they are very comfortable and they look good with his skinny jeans too!Also a great price too.
214872,1,"Hey, I won't lie. I like hip shoes. However, my feet don't have the best arches. And while these shoes look like your average hipster lowtops, they provide much more support, arch, and comfort that something like an adidas shell-toe or Converses.I've got a pair of black-reds, and received complements on them.Just bought a pair of ""elephant"" colored ones, and they fit great.I was suprised to see that there are far more colors available here than at the Puma store on Market St. in San Francisco."
22187,1,we recently brought these shoes from amazon and they are great comfortable shoes to wear. The postage and packing was good as well and arrived about the time they said they would. will definitely buy agagin
128082,1,I love these boots they are great!!! They go with so many things and are very easy to walk in as well. :)
209349,1,Fit as expected. Tabs for velcro closures are nice and long enough and designed well.
130435,1,I've wanted dancing shoes for years and these fit the bill perfectly. Nice fit for a wide while not appearing wide.
19540,2,"I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit. This time, the same size, 6M did not fit, they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes, I looked inside my old shoes to find the size, I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful, just what I was looking for, but not a good fit."
110414,1,"The tennis shoes arrived in just a few short days, which was perfect. I had no problem with the delivery or the shoes. I got exactly what I ordered in a timely manner. Thanks!!"
76641,1,"I have had this pair of shoe for almost 8 months now, and I must say that it is my most comforable pair ever. I have owned everything from Rockports, Hush puppies, Bill Blass and Payless, and these have the most support and cushion of any of them, and they have been durable. Although I can't say that I have owned any fitted italian leather shoes, A couple of pairs of dress shoes I have bought have run around 120 to 150. this is significantly less, and has held up better and more comfort. I bought mine at a larger retailer on sale for $30, and I commonly see them on sale here at Amazon or at som retail outlets in or around malls. These shoes are a great investment for everyday use, and my job does involve significant walking, and the shoes will help you, the Kentech system in them is outstanding (and cool looking as well). So this is a great purchase for value, comfort, and overlooked because it is not the ""name brand""."
73650,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
337198,1,"I have spent several years looking for a practical walking, comfortable white sandal. A friend suggested to check Amazon and I am so happy I did. These sandals are comfortable and exactly what I wanted. The price was reasonable too!"
162899,1,I was very pleased with the ugg slippers I purchased. I got them for my daughter and she likes them very much.
246929,1,"I just got these and love them. My only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow, even though I don't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes. The dark red color is a little deeper than the picture, but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer. If you're gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available, these are a great choice."
109349,0,"Bought this for my cousin, he said it an big about half to a whole size. He's an 8.5 and i bought him the 8.5 and its big on him but he was fine with it since he wears thick socks anyway. The color black was really nice and the design as well. As for the quality, can't speak for it right now since we just got it but so far upon close inspection when i got the shoes, it look durable and made well so hopefully it'll last long."
38845,1,"The only casual shoe my husband will wear. He wears them to work every day, and goes through about 2 pair a year. He is hard on shoes and these hold up very well. He says they are the most comfortable shoe he can find. Most stores no longer carry this style. I was very happy to find them with the help of Amazon.com."
9781,1,"I love these boots, I wear them to work. I do alot of walking at work and this is the only boot that I have found to stand up to the waer and tear and they are a great value for the money. I would buy another pair."
178515,1,"The Last time I wore a pair of these, my codename was Roadrunner, fastest boy in the universe...lol.I bought these more for the nostalgiathan anything else.I have no complaints"
375566,1,I love these boots!!! However after wearing them a few times they feel big so I would suggest you buy them a 1/2 size smaller for the perfect fit.
170595,1,I have a very narrow foot. Hard and expensive to fit. VANELi is one of the few shoes that meet my needs. These flats are great - can dress up or down. Would like to have a pair in every color.
234469,0,"They are rather tight for a medium width, and, although they are described as having a 1-1/2 inch heel, I measured the heel at 1/2"", the same as the Liberty Flat, which sells for $20 less. The low heel makes them less dressy than what I thought I was getting."
241607,1,"It's the first time when I bought this type of shoe, but I'm telling you, I love it; comfortable, cool, nice, I can't take eyes off them; Yes I'm talking about ""CONVERSE"" by Chuck Taylor, baby."
257222,1,"Careness needed, eyes wanted.More black, deeper melancholy.Stand like Lightening, carved like leaves.Fierce appoint, hard shave."
92784,0,"I am pleased with this shoe...however it isnot leather and I'm sure it was advertisedas such.Thanks,GW"
285098,0,"This is a nice looking shoe, well made and good price. But I had to return them because the medium width was too narrow for my usual size B. A wide width probably would have worked, but was not available. Too bad, because I liked the style and construction, and basic oxfords for women are hard to find these days. I usually buy Timberland oxfords, and wear a 7 B, but they have no oxford styles for women at the present."
311226,1,"Great and beautiful shoes.Very pretty. Was so happy to get them.They run small so order a size bigger.Comfortable except, for a slight rubbing on the back of my heel.Would have been a blister if had worn them longer. That was the first time I wore them , so? I love them ,though. They are comfy enough for water shoes.Went swimming in them and they were great, dried and kept my feet protected. A little slippery in a restaurant floor that I guess was polished and shiny.That was a little scary, so do not wear them to a restaurant with clean floors :)Only negative I could find. I love them ."
375839,1,"I ordered a pair of these sneakers and WOW! Let me tell you these are the most supportive sneakers I have ever owned. I need extra support in the ankle area and in the arch, these are definately supportive. As a matter of fact when I take them off I wish I could put them back on my feet are so comfortable."
126831,1,They feel comfortable and true to size. The black and white go with everything. I'll be buying this same pair again.
159880,1,Paid prioty post for this as had no choice . It cost $50. Double the price of the shoes. The shoes above I paid for the slower postage. It cost $19 for the three pairs. Was told they would arrive in about 3 weeks. The boots in 3 to 4 days. The boots arrived as said and three other pairs arrived the very Next Day!!!!! Felt totally ripped off in regards to the boots!!!!!'
31324,2,"I think I would have loved this shoe for my 3 year old, but the black buckle piece broke within an hour of her wearing it! She was just around the house and it popped off and the inside was broken. The color was cute though. Wish Amazon had not run out so I could have exchanged them. I had to take a refund instead. Probably why they were only $[...]when I bought them!"
342865,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
141557,0,"This has been a decent winter running shoe with plenty of stability, fair amount of cushion, and decent traction. My primary gripe has been the insert not staying in place and riding back in the shoe."
109486,1,"I bought this pair of converse for my daughter, and she loves them. They are so comfortable to wear and great quality as well."
308052,1,"This is standard issue footwear for anyone who wants the ""look"" of indie rock (the others are t-shirts that look to be from a redneck bar circa 1978 but really came from a suburban Old Navy circa 2010 and those ""washed-out"" blue jeans that were purchased at the same Old Navy). The shoes are grossly unfit for any athletic activity (I don't know how the heck I survived playing street hockey in these things as a teenager), provide no protection against the cold or stepping on sharp objects, begin to smell horribly after 9+ months of use and have a tendency to have the sole tear away from the rest of the shoe after those 9 months (if the smell hasn't destroyed them yet). But their coolness factor will never, ever be replicated by any footwear, past, present or future (the Roman sandal gave them a run for their money in the 1980s by the garage punk band Thee Mighty Caesars, but that's another story). Everyone should own a pair of these shoes at least once in their lifetimes."
265599,1,I've been an Evironmental Scientist slogging through the swamps of Florida for over twenty years. These boots are the best I've used. They are surprisingly waterproof and comfortable for all-day hiking. I've had my current pair for more than five years and they are just now starting to get ragged. I'm gonna buy another pair right now without even shopping for an alternative.
375214,1,"This is my first pair of Danner boots, and I must say that they are the most comfortable boots I have ever owned."
333671,1,Lasts about 6 months with daily 4-mile walks on pavement. Lasts about a year in the gym with exercise equipment. I get good angle support and good arch support. Washes well.
290151,1,"I have black in color in wide which fits me well. Its comfortable to wear for any occasion with khakis or dress pants or with suits. Sharp, leather upper and inner and soft sole so your feet won't hurt while standing or walking around. Great for office work, business or executive environment. This shoe qualifies to be tactical in terms of quality, durability, looks, price wise. :)"
359718,1,"I've been running in New Balance for years for my narrow feet. A store suggested I try these instead, and I did. What a difference! Now, I float instead of plod, by knees don't hurt after running and I feel like I'm faster.I did have to replace the insoles with ones with stronger arch support. That filled up the extra space and gave me a perfect combination: great cushioning with real support."
22620,1,These are great all around shoes for toddlers and pre-schoolers. They are easy to put on and very easy to keep clean.
11073,1,"Absolutely beautiful boot and can't wait to wear them. We don't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can. Sorry I can't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport, I doubt I will be disappointed."
371506,1,"Im usually 10.5-11 on all my shoes , mostly Puma... So i did ask 10.5 for this , but Omg they are like an inch biger . So im sending back.. The didnt want to exchange them because the restocking fee .. So be carefull .. They are nice looking , but It is really to much the difrent sizing..."
257080,1,"buy them for the new year, I like the classic tennis and this is perfect, comfortable and a great price. certainly buy them again."
187671,1,"I received an Amazon.com gift certificate, and thought I would give these Mary Jane Crocs a try. I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they were, and how cute they were on. I was looking for a shoe that I could wear in the summer barefoot, and that could be worn with shorts, skirts, and jeans. I must say that I found that shoe in these mary jane crocs. I would say that they were well worth the purchase, and I am thinking about getting another pair in a different color."
118284,1,Purchased for my 7 year old. I usually purchase her a brand new pair of ballet shoes before the recital at the end of the year and these shoes are perfect. This is her third year and these shoes would be perfect for the newbie or the seasoned dancer. I would recommend these cute ballet shoes.
281615,1,Very Comfortable and just the right fit. I work as a teacher and they are really comfortable to be on them all day. Another great product by Clarks!
333722,1,Dada basketball shoes are a quality item. They're the only brand of shoes my son wears.
269053,1,This is my 2nd pair of these. I liked them so much that 15 months later I purchased them $20 cheaper than the 1st time I bought them. Also I was told it would take 6 days to get them {president's day weekend} but I recieved them in 3!
176807,1,I liked these very much. My son said they were very comfortable not like weejuns from bass that are so hard to break in. also rubber sole helped with not being slick on bottom.
79760,0,"From reading some of the other reviews I thought the bottoms would be more cushioned than they are. They are just okay in my opinion, not bad, but not as comfortable as others I've owned."
244726,1,"My husband thought the boots were very comfortable, soft leather, not too heavy. He has not worn them to work in yetbut they fit very nicely and seem like they will be good quality work boots. The price was reasonable, too."
233174,1,"This brand fits me very well, making it easy to order online which I have done more than a dozen times."
381161,1,"I love my Samba Milleniums! They're super comfortable, and have that extra little bit of fashion that the classic Sambas don't. The shorter tongue is especially nice, since I don't use them for soccer, and found that the classic tongues tend to stick up in an ugly way."
255738,0,I purchased these K Swiss because they were a wide. Once I put them on my son they weren't very wide at all.
336740,1,I'm on my feet for about 6 hours a day and love these boots. I'm on my second pair and have been very happy with both.
122581,1,"I got the red laces and am about to order more in a different color. As others have stated, the color is slightly darker than the picture, which was probably taken with bright lighting. The shipping was quick. Overall a good company and good product."
154549,1,Very comfortable shoe that is great for walking. True to size and and needs no break in time!
62603,1,"These Keds are everything the seller described. Size runs true to form, they are extremely comfortable and look great!"
3398,1,"Over the years I've typically bought much higher end hiking boots but was tired of spending over $200 and wanted to find something comparable at a lower price point. These were recommended to me by a friend and after reading the reviews I decided to give them a try. I was not disappointed. I have taken them out a few times for both long (12-14 hour) and short (4-6 hour)hikes after breaking them in around the house for a couple of weeks. As a geologist I've also worn them to do field work a number of times and they have held up to climbing, hiking and all manner of abuse while doing field work. They are extremely comfortable on my foot and ankle, have given me no blisters and are light enough not to tire you out after a long morning of trekking through whatever it is you want to trek through. I didn't find my feet getting hot or developing hot spots and in the end, forgot about my feet altogether (Which is a first). They are waterproof as promised and heavy dew, shallow streams/mud puddles won't even phase them as my feet stayed dry all day long. The only test remains to be how well they stand up over time. I inspect my boots after every use and so far, they don't appear to have any weak spots at all. I highly recommend these boots for medium to light duty hiking or work scenarios."
46710,1,"I bought my first pair at a department store at a higher price. When I saw these were on sale, I had to get another pair. There were so many colors to choose from. Since my first pair was brown, I thought I'd get this Cotton color. So cute and comfy, I always get compliments when I wear them!"
104221,1,These are great shoes. I hope that they stay around a bit longer they go with alot of things for spring and summer
259844,1,"Purchased for my daughter. She loves the sneaker, runs slightly larger than normal shoe size. I would order 1/2 size smaller."
114029,1,"Excellent pair of Boat Shoe's !!!These are hard to find, but worth the effort.Highly Recomended !!!"
371052,2,"I bought this thong in a 13 B (medium), and had to return it to get a wide width because my toes could curl over the sides at the top. My toes still curl over the top, just not as much. The thong digs into the space between my big toe and next little toe, and actually broke the skin. They were extremely uncomfortable to wear and I always felt I had to move my foot awkwardly to keep them on. I am guessing, though, that that is the nature of any flip-flop. I bought these because I do not like flip-flops, and wanted something a little more classy. It certainly looks nice, but I will never buy a flip-flop again."
267355,1,"This is my second pair of this Hi Tec boot. The first pair lasted a very long time and was very comfortable the whole time. They break in right away. For years I was a die hard Danner buyer and I can say these beat my last pair of over priced Danner hikers hands down. (really they were more sneaker than hiker -I still love my Danner steel toes for a work boot) But my favorite thing about these Hi Tec boots are the eyes and hooks -THEY ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER OWNED. The laces last forever because the eyes and hooks are so smooth and rounded. Like I said, just bought my second pair -five star goodness."
303154,1,"I've loved wearing the two pairs of these sandals that I have, and they've held up really well. The tan ones have been fine, but the blue-dyed ones got wet once, and they stained my feet blue quite badly. It was very hard to remove, and I went around with very odd-looking feet for quite a while. I'd like to buy more because they adjust to fit my narrow feet, but I'm afraid the black ones will stain my feet black if I get caught in the rain."
299601,1,"These shoes are so adorable, and they get tons of compliments. I prefer the way Robeez stay on the foot with elastic, though. My 14-month-old likes to pull the Pedipeds off, and it's easy to do thanks to the Velcro straps. I wonder if he's still just getting used to them--he'd worn Robeez for so long, they were part of his feet. I'm not ready to give up on them yet, and we'll probably buy more."
274679,1,"I compared hiking boots for quite awhile trying to choose the best for my situation. My ankles had been bothering me if I pushed too hard for years. Last fall, I injured some ligaments and tendons in my right heel and it was painful to walk. I reviewed and read reviews of hiking boots up to about $600, comparing features, weight, etcetera. I was unwilling to spend that much not being sure they would work for me. Many hiking boots are not available as a wide width, which I need. I read a review of hiking boots under $200, focused on the Hi-Tec Altitude boot; liked the price, features, and weight, and bought a pair. When they arrived, I put them on and was impressed how comfortable they were right out of the box. I wore them around home to break them in for several days, then went for a three mile walk - my feet felt great. Because everything I really like is sometimes not available when I need to replace them, I ordered a second pair and put them on the shelf for future use. I have had them several months now and am reveling in my new freedom."
121691,0,"The sandals are comfortable and all. But when you walk the back end ""FLAPS"" to your heal too hard. Due to the fact that the air portion of the sandals are big and heavy.Rather have the other Reefs without the air so it'll be less heavy and bulky."
37265,1,"These were a gift for my husband. He had his last pair of Danner boots for 13 years, and wore them daily through harsh winters, hiking trips, all over Europe, had them resoled at least two times. Finally, this year, he was ready for a new pair. He insisted on getting exactly the same kind, and even waited several months after Christmas, for his size to come in. He is thrilled with his new pair, and hasn't even needed a breaking-in period. These are high quality, waterproof boots--built to last!"
209764,1,"I live in Texas, but last summer I was in Wyoming on a two week vacation. Five days into my vacation my feet were killing me. In the past few years I have been suffering from a collapsed arch. My previous favorite shoes had failed during the trip. I was at the point that I had to constantly stop and rest my feet.I always wanted some cowboy boots. I figured that if they were good enough for cowboys to use for a hundred years, unchanged, then they were worth trying out for myself. I visited the Western Outfitters in Jackson Hole and found a very helpful sales person. I specified that I wanted some low-key boots that would look better the longer I owned them. She pointed me towards several models, but I fell in love with the natural leather look of the Distressed Brown Ariat boots. I tried them on found them to be very comfortable. I ended up wearing them the rest for the rest of my trip. For the rest of the trip my feet nor arch ever hurt. I was able to walk, hike and even wear them during some horse back riding. All I can say is I credit the boots for letting me enjoy more of my vacation.I managed to get them scratched, dusty and wet during the trip. Since that trip I now wear the boots nearly every day. I can say that my feet never hurt when I wear them, even during long walking trips. I haven't had to add an insole to the boots six months after wearing them like I have had to do with previous shoes. And after months of wear and tear the boots have a great worn-in leather look with no large visible scratches. The boots are still as comfortable as ever and the insole has not flattened out.My only con on these boots is that ankle on the left boot tends to tighten up. This can make removing or putting that boot on very tough. To loosen it I wrapped the angle of my boot tree with some cloth."
362208,1,Easy Spirit AP1 has been my most comfortable shoe for years. Not only is it comfortable but I think it is nice looking. It does not look big and bulky. I also buy them in black for the winter..The shoes arrived very fast.....
180519,1,"I have been wearing these shoes for most of my life. They aren't $15. anymore, but they are still worth the money. They are very flat, so don't forget to get some insoles with arches for them! You may want to add 1/2 a shoe size for this."
85165,1,Just Absolutely the best. Can't find anything better.last ones I bought haven't worn out even after 5 years of use.
373362,1,These are the most comfortable shoes for work ever. I gave it four stars because the color was a little off from description other than that the shoes ae great.
11399,0,A size different from my order was sentand I ended up paying tge return postage. The boot looks nice but it runs small.
263006,1,"I felt that my karma would be bad if I didn't take a moment to describe my experience in dealing with GrandSlamNY. I purchased a pair of Converse All Star's for my girlfriend for Christmas. I got the size she asked for (even took into account the additional information supplied on the site about how the size of this particular shoe runs about a size big. When they arrived they were too big! I THEN checked the return policy and saw that the period had expired (I partied hard during the holidays and the shoes were returned close to 4 weeks after purchase. I sent an email to the owner of the store and he told me to send them back for exchange. I did so and received the new pair 4 days after mailing the incorrect pair back to him. I will do business with them again because, on top of everything, for the size I needed, GrandSlam had the lowest price. Good lookin, David."
369801,1,"I am a member of the local Honor Guard, we perform last military rites at veteranfunerals. I needed footwear that looked good and would stand up to all kinds ofweather, i.e. mud, snow, etc. My new Corcoran's are just what I was looking for andneeded. I spent several hours spit-shinning them, to get them to the shine that Ineeded. They have already been through the mud and snow of Winter. They kept theirhigh luster through all of it. All I do is brush them off, when I get back home, and they are ready for the next service. I am well pleased. I owned a pair when Iwas in the Military, and they lasted me several years. I am looking forward to get-ting several more years out of this pair. I will certainly do more business withAmazon.com, in the future."
155326,1,My husband told me he needed new boots. I told him we need to check Amazon for the Justin boots. He was impressed with the price and how fast we recieved them. The boots was very true to size. He said they were very comfortabe.and made of good quality. I would recommend this boot to every man.
305628,1,"My son has dropped arch's and severe pronation from fast weight gain from all chemo meds. We went the route of medical orthotics and in grade school all he got was blisters and couldn't walk or any extra activities. We found these shoes and have purchased them ever since. Not only can he walk without pain, he's proud to say he's not last doing the mile run at school!!!!! I greatly recommend these shoes to any one I talk to, they've made a extreme difference in his life!!!!!!!!"
344913,1,"These are really cool shoes, the materials are cheap, they don't lace up high enough. If you're wearing them casualally buy them! But for basketball, you may as well go to walmart and buy some basketball shoes they are awful"
255807,1,very good product. my son is 18 months old and really seems to enjoy his new shoes.. they appear to be well made.
252743,1,Receiver??? You are denied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Adidas plus talented corner back equals devistating defense and victory against any offense!! Adidas is Victory!!
186771,1,"Asics women's gel max were a pleasant surprise to get.Very stylish, comfy and good for my feet."
230333,1,I love my Franco Sarto shoes. They are very comfortable and the price was very reasonable. I comparison shopped before I purchased on [...]. I also got free shipping which was an added bonus!
318109,0,"these boots are cute, i got them in black, however they are too big for my calf.. they flop around."
250750,1,"I had them since I was in HS and they were one of the most comfy shoes I have had since. I am now about 3 years into college and they continue to be my favorite pair... And of course, Globe knows their stuff!Enjoy!:)"
326188,0,They didn't have the color I wanted so I settled for a different color shoe.
290403,1,"The Rockport Prowalker is the nearest thing to perfection in a walking shoe. It's light weightyet very sturdy, it has a timeless look aboutit and yet it provide real comfort. I've wornRockports for 15 years and will continue becausethere is nothing better on the market.JimB"
365946,1,It's a Chuck Taylor through and through. Not much support but I don't care. These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway. So we just dropped it in and he was good to go. He wore these with his tux for the prom. He was stylin' and comfortable. I do recommend going up 1/2 size if you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short.
370315,1,"This is a great pair of shoes -- comfortable, cute and casual. I get compliments on these all the time!"
9511,1,Very happy with shoe. Provided good support and traction. First pair survived over 1000km of training and the Camino de Santiago. Purchased new pair to go on next expedition.
84762,1,"These shoes are great for skating, the soles of the shoe have a nice flat bottom with thick rubber that gives a solid feel on the deck of the skateboard with padding on the inside. I skate ditches a few times a week and can usually get a few months out of a pair of these shoes before wearing holes in the soles of the shoes."
170298,1,I bought these shoes in 2007 and have yet to wear them. They are very pretty though.
140339,1,I've ordered and worn this shoe for years; it is unfailingly comfortable and long-lasting. I plan to wear it walking the Camino to Santiago in Spain this fall.
288190,0,If this shoe is a wide I'd hate to see the regular. If it didn't say 9W in the shoe I would have sworn it was a 9N. I will be returned!
120289,1,"i really love this shoe! it is comfortable. I am hard on any kind of shoes, they stand up well to wear and tear. they are great! this is my second pair."
276783,1,"Went to Yellowstone in these boots. They were comfortable, waterproof and did well on the 328 steps to get down to lower falls."
146204,1,"I spent several days researching the right pair of boots. I narrowed it down to UGGs which had very positive reviews but were pricey, and EMUs which seemed to be basically the same product for half the price. Sounds too good to be true? It is.Here is what I found:- UGGs are made of sheepskin inside and out, and cost $130-$160 forthe most popular type (called Classic, short or tall), more for the""fancier"" varieties (but I honestly prefer the look of the Classicmodel)- EMUs have TWO types of products: (1) sheepskin inside and out, and(2) cowhide outside, merino wool inside. The first variety cost thesame as the UGGs, the second one (not as cozy, not as comfi) costabout half the priceSo, I went with the UGGs which appear to be the more original/popular and am VERY VERY happy - these boots really insulate you from the harsh cold completely. Happy feet are worth the $$ for me in thise case. I got the tall variety in grey, and LOVE LOVE LOVE them.Another misconception that I'd like to correct - NEITHER is 100% waterproof - as in they'll basically keep you warm and dry in a reasonable amount of rain/snow, but if you drench them it will show (common sense). UGGs has real waterproof models which are more like regular snow boots etc. UGGs also has a water-resistant treatment to improve the durability, but friends I spoke to didn't do that and haven't had any water seeping in when she's worn UGGs in the rain.So basically, the real deal sheepskin product costs the same (and is similar in quality, comfort).I had such a hard time figuring this out - shame on all the websites for sneakily pretending that the cheaper EMUs are made of the same material, which they are not!"
375465,0,"I just received these boots and the front toe of the boots are WAY longer than pictured. they look more square or shorter in the picture, but they are really long, making your feet look extremely bigger than it is. They do run true to size and i dont have any other CD shoes to compare it to, but this one was a first disappointment. Look at Nordstrom's website to see a better actual photo. I'll be returning this one."
110026,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
195499,1,I LOVE these shoes and was looking all over for them. They are comfortable and can be worn to dress up any casual outfit. Once on your feet the sexiness just spills out... I am sooo very happy with my order and I am glad I was able to find them here.
388430,1,"I initially ordered the 9B and found them to be both longer and narrower than I had anticipated. Exchanging them was quick and painless, but the exchanged pair came with the right boot just slightly wider than the left. I've decided the difference is negligible, so I'm keeping this pair. They still need to be broken in (especially in the ankles), but the foot bed is well padded and very comfortable."
10251,1,Love these boots. Have this style in about 7 colors. These are my favorite for work as the grey is a beautiful color and goes with my black work cargo pants. I brush them clean when they get dusty and they still look good as new. Very comfortable for all day on my feet and I have a high arch. Good support.
355977,1,"My wife got a pair of these crocs and absolutely loved them so I figured I would give them a try and I purchased a pair myself. They are the most comfortable shoe to wear. They look nice, they hold up well, they are so light and they massage your feet while you walk because they have all these little bubbles inside. I purchase them before we went on vacation and loved them because they can get wet or anything and can't hurt them. You really need to try a pair of crocs. You won't be disappointed."
50314,2,"I received this boot and had to return it immediately due to sizing. I have to agree with the other reviewer who wrote that the width is way off on these boots. Ordered an 8.5 M but should've gotten an EE. The boot was of very good quality and the price was right. But after it cost me $19 to return the package, I'd rather go to Boot Barn which carries this same model for about $5 more. That way I can try them on and carry them out. I did call Barebones Workwear to ask if they'd refund my return shipping fee as well as send me an 8.5EE but they refused to refund so I guess I learned a few things from this experience. First off I'm done buying clothing especially footwear online. Secondly I will probably not use any non Amazon Vendors that way my return shipping will always be covered. If you do decide to continue your purchase with Barebones Workwear, use caution in choosing the width as to what you normally would wear. If they don't fit when you get them it will cost a good bit to return. Best of Luck hope this helps somebody."
229104,1,"I got a pair of yellow low-tops for Christmas last year and I LOVE THEM!!! They're about to get holes in them because I wear them so much, and I'm trying to pick out what color I should get. There's so much to love about these shoes. There's like 25 colors to pick from, so there is the oppourtunity to have a piar for EVERY SINGLE OUTFIT. Or, you can wear just one pair, like I do, and mine go with everything. These shoes are breathable, unlike tennis shoes, so your feet don't get all sweaty, which is nice too. These shoes are quite flat inside, but there's nothing that an insert can't fix. THESE SHOES ARE THE BEST!!!"
196318,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
107589,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
245021,1,"I purchased this shoes as a gift to my wife. She has a delicated foot, but with this shoes she feels so comfortable. Good choose !!"
173267,1,"I had been looking for navy sandals in my hard to find size for about a year. Finally found them, but decided canvas close toe shoes looked better with skirts. Service was good."
273451,0,the quality of everything on the sandal is great with the exception of the upper sole (the straw-like part where the bottom of your feet touch)....it is like straw or some weak fiber and wears down fast to the material beneath and looks dirty...this is after maybe 2 mos of wear a coupla days a week...and I'm not out hiking or anything....totally normal wear. They're not worth the msrp or anywhere close to it...I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for a new pair after having owned them.
94790,1,"I have a hard time with shoes especially ones with heels but these are great, my feet never hurt!"
336232,1,"I love them ! Received them rather qickly , and they are so comfortable.now if i can keep my kids out of them !"
250852,1,Fit is right and they look great. Comfortable right out of the box.I definitely recommend these shoes to anyone looking for dress shoes
241390,1,Arrived in 2 days.Still the same wonderful shoes I remember from high school 25 years ago.
91612,1,these shoes are by no means as good as my dockers but they've stood the test of time and that says alot coming from me...
330489,1,"It was great to once again wear the Adidas 1974 Italia training shoe. The shoe still fits the same, feels the same and looks the same as I remembered them. So much more comfortable than trainers of today which cost more than 3 - 4 times the price. I just happened to see if by chance they were still available, and I was astounded that they were available from Amazon. The only downside was that Amazon can't supply direct to Australia. Just as well I have some wonderful friends in California who posted them to me once they were delivered to them. A long way round to do business, but there ya go, I GOT MY SHOES!!!!! WhooHoo!"
149498,0,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
299821,1,I bought a new pair as my old ones were well... old 15+ yrs. I still use the old ones these new ones fit the same and are comfy but they squeak like crazy. Both of them and i don't know how to make them stop. I've had them over a year now and they still do it. Which is why 1 star is missing.
305998,1,They fit and felt great right out of the box. I would recommend these shoes to anyone.
64844,1,"I used to have a keds as a kid and I wasn't sure whether I would want a shoe that I had during my childhood. I don't regret anything about these shoes, they are just as comfortable as I remembered them."
371936,1,"the most confortable shoes,is like orthopedic,nice price,i got a good discount on them.just perfect"
175237,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
250059,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
68310,0,"The color of the shoe was better than I thought. The shoe is made of a more traditional, stiff leather. It is a little loose and the right foot when I step creases across the toes causing discomfort. I kept them because I liked the style and color. I have hopes the leather will eventually soften with use. It is my first pair of cole hans. The price was right on amazon!"
120227,0,They fit but I do not like the feel of the flip flop :( Ive been wanting to try these for years and feel let down
369401,1,"Whether you're buying them for military service, or just wearing them for the style like myself, you can't go wrong with boots like these. Solid, sturdy, and comfortable... when properly laced these boots grip the calf, and after a short break-in period, are as comfortable as sneakers. The cost only reflects the quality of the product... I may not be buying another pair of boots ever again."
289826,1,"very comfortable , a bit wide ,but soft leather and beautiful color -good for all day standing on your feet"
155907,1,"Although it is a little bit small, overall it is a good shoe: very confortable and I like the color"
205015,1,I have a high arch and find it difficult to get footwear that supports my high arch. These sandals are well designed and provide support for my feet. I have purchased additional pairs for my son and husband. Highly recommend Chaco's
239223,1,"Been looking for a slip-on sneaker/walking shoe in local stores for a long time. I have bought those suede-like slip-ons...but not very comfortable after awhile. These shoes, on the other hand, are very comfortable. I am a 51 yr old heavy-set fella, and these shoes feel really good. I don't know about the wash-n-wear part...and doubt I'll attempt that....these are leather. Anyway, for the money. seems like a good buy."
119975,0,"I got these shoes for cross country and then found out that these shoes are not running shoes. The first week i wore them they were great and they looked awesome, but after about three weeks of running they began to tatter at the toe. They also do not have the best support. These are nice shoes but i would not recomend these to any serious runners."
186821,1,"I bought these boots for a costume, and after 2 years of average use (6-12 hours a month) they are still going strong.I ordered size 13 mens, and it came a little large, as if it was a wide, but nothing a simple insert couldn't fix.I am very happy with my purchase, and they have held together more than I thought they would. I was a little concerned about quality because the price was so good, but I have not been disappointed.I will definitely purchase from Pleaser again for my next boots."
49361,2,"It was delivered at time. And seemed to be a good deal at the first glance; however, it wasn't.When I started wearing that Ferrari shoe, which is the reason why I bought it, the edge of the rubber bottom started to loose its ability to be stuck to upper leather and exibit a bad apearance. Maybe because the product was stored in stock for a long time or maybe for other reasons. Any way, the prodoct wasn't the same value or quality of pumma's shoes that I have bought in the past."
41607,1,"I had owned a pair similar to these before and was impressed with their durability, long lasting and remain looking good. These shoes are comfortable right out of the box without need for any break-in."
233030,0,"The shoe is nice, soft, supple leather, sole appears to be a good traction one, but not for dress wear; It also looks like it will wear down fairly quickly compared to harder soles. It seems comfortable at first, but the sole is too flexible if you have a foot problem, as I do. It causes excessive pressure on the ball of the foot and that leads to pain and to swelling, even when wearing orthotics inside it. If your feet are fine and you have no orthotic issues, and you want a good casual shoe that will be used outside or on slippery surfaces, this will probably do you well. I don't wear miine--ony used them several times."
262683,1,"Bought as a Christmas gift for my son....he hasn't seen them yet but the overall service dealing with Amazon is always great & the shoes look pretty awesome, I think he will love them"
206335,1,"What a great purchase and worth it, it is everything they said it was and I am a happy customer."
374047,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
44788,1,"Pros:- Shoes look shiny and beautiful. Very elegant, too. Having seen them on a Bostonian store, I knew the way they would look, so no dissapointment (nor surprise) there.- After four three weeks of use, they are still holding up good, with no visible crevices or lines. Hopefully, that will last for long!Cons:- Pricy."
316294,1,Size matter. i usually wear 8 or 8.5 but 7 for me is fit enough.Then i have to say Moc is really wonderful i love it a lot!!!
150405,1,"On the Amazon page, these shoes were listed for 24.95 or something similar to that. Amazon apparently passes this order along to ""Shoe Mall"" and the price there was 59.95. The shoes were listed with the size and then AA, or AAA. On the bottom of my old shoes the width is listed as N for narrow. The problem was that I did not get any information until the order was confirmed. I still wanted to order these shoes, because I like them and can no longer find them in the department stores here in Orlando. I could not see the finished order to confirm that it was what I wanted until I got the confirmation. When the shoes were received, they were too narrow and I had to return them for a different size. Returning cost me $8.90. It has not been a very good experience."
245762,1,"I've been wearing these shoes for about 2 weeks now and I really like them. They fit great from the first wearing, which is rare for me. They may not be the most attractive shoes, but they feel good. I wear them with jeans, dress pants, and skirts with dark tights."
240983,1,Very comfortable boot. I'm a contractor working for the US Army in Afghanistan and I needed a comfortable boot able to take some abuse. These boots are high quality and one of the few I've found with the side zip that are this comfortable and durable.
333020,1,My son needed these for wrestling and is very happy with them. He says they are comfortable and also look good. I would recommend them to anyone.
120581,1,"I guess you are always nervous when buying items from overseas, but this was the only way I was going to get Black Teva's. (Brown only avail in Oz)I have had the shoes on all day, and I must say I am very happy with my purchase, no blisters, no rubbing, and very comfortable."
129494,1,"These pumps are perfect! I got them in multi. The heel was about 2 1/2 inches and were even prettier in person.Love,Love,Love!Please make more multicolored low heeled pumps.I hate stilettos!"
160258,1,As always converse well never let you down with these silver boots! I love tham and use them all the time!
310139,0,"I don't think that these shoes are original converse ,but in any case the quality is acceptable and they are true to size.It seems that one can not get original stuff these days."
200339,1,"great shoes, extremely comfortable and stylish. I wear the shoes either with or without socks. Sometimes it can be difficult in tough weather conditions."
286354,1,Not many shoe companies bother to make different widths. That's amazing considering that millions live in this country alone and they can't all have the same feet width. The extra width means I no longer get corns and blisters. Plus the show is very good. I'm stuck on New Balance.
184564,1,I was soooo tickled pink with my pink Nellie Chukka boots. I saw them on the web page and I had to have them. Pink is my favorite color. They are extremely well made. They didn't need breaking in either. That is a major plus. They fit perfectly. Also they arrived in record time except it was like waiting for Christmas. I love them so much it is all I can do not to wear them to bed. :-) I want several more pairs. I am waiting for them to be available in red leather.
195321,1,This is at least my third pair of Mick Fanning Reef Sandals and I love them. They are super comfortable and the bottle opener really comes in handy.
214917,1,"Hey, I won't lie. I like hip shoes. However, my feet don't have the best arches. And while these shoes look like your average hipster lowtops, they provide much more support, arch, and comfort that something like an adidas shell-toe or Converses.I've got a pair of black-reds, and received complements on them.Just bought a pair of ""elephant"" colored ones, and they fit great.I was suprised to see that there are far more colors available here than at the Puma store on Market St. in San Francisco."
129231,0,Not as good as I was hoping. Have not yet found anything as comfortable from day one as my Wolverine boots.
116032,1,"These shoes are great. They are really comfortable, and very fashionable as well. Could be lighter but I would buy them again!"
244062,1,"These tap shoes worked for me. They are comfortable and well made. I usually wear an 8 or 8 1/2 in street shoes, and the 8 1/2 tap shoes fit me perfectly.My 9 year old daughter wears a 3 in street shoes. She wears a 5 in these tap shoes and loves themDance on!"
36753,1,"I've been eyeing the graphite colored Keds for awhile now and I am not disappointed that I finally bought them!I am normally a size 9 to 9.5 in shoes, and because of the loose fit from a previous pair of size 9.5 Keds, I went with a size 9. So they fit perfectly. I've worn them walking around the city a few times and have had no pressure points/no blisters/no sore spots. That's the ultimate test for me--comfort in walking. Well, they definitely passed the test."
320328,2,Sizing is off. I ordered my size 7.5 and they are way too big. I should have ordered the 6.5 which I never wear. The cost of shipping them back for the correct size was too much. I ended up keeping them even though they just sit on my shelf.
74517,0,"Crocs were received fast. It Looks and fits good but side snap was broken fast, it was lost in a week. not sure , how to fix it now. is any place to buy them?"
116608,1,"The shoes are great. Perfect for my toddler! She wears them will all her dressup outfits, as well as to her jazz class. Thank you!"
325203,1,"Awesome cleats. Comfortable and Amazing. Price is good, I almost cheeped out to save $30 to buy another pair and I'm so glad I didn't. I'd recommend these cleats and plan to be a lifetime customer of the Copa's."
56253,1,Feel like I 40 yrs. younger. For a causal shoe for Santa these are Great. I really enjoy them feels great to be able to wear a really well made shoe. Thanks ConverseSANTA GARY
281866,1,"These shoes are great, timelessly stylish and very comfortable. I read in other reviews that the fit ran large, but this wasn't true of my experience. I was apprehensive of placing my order after reading about other's fitment issues, so I went to the mall and tried on another style of Clarks shoe in my size and found them to fit correctly. I felt confident these would fit similarly, so I placed the order and was right. I wear a 9 in athletic shoes and an 8 in casual or dress shoes; I ordered an 8 and it fits perfectly. Im just guessing, but maybe the reviewers who found that the fitment large mostly wear athletic shoes and didn't consider the sizing difference when moving to a casual shoe. As others have described, the finish of the beeswax leather is not as shown in the picture, but more a chocolate brown out of the box. I've now been wearing these for about three weeks and can say that over said time the shoes are beginning to develop finish comparable to the one pictured, and that I can see them looking just like it with future wear. All in all a great shoe, they go great with jeans or chinos, and are as comfortable as they are stylish."
193914,1,"I buy these shoes for my daughter to wear for P.E., she love them! The soles are thick and sturdy, something the school wants the kids to have. This is our tried and tested tennis shoe we use year after year! My daughter is 7 years old and has no problem in wearing these shoes."
260794,1,"I had my first pair of Converse All-stars in high school in the early 1960's. That was before they were known as ""Chucks."" They were, and still are, the best basketball sneakers around. They're good for everyday workouts and just hanging around the house. Comfortable, inexpensive and they last just about forever."
329331,1,"I have owned this type of flip flop for many years now. I love them. They are so durable and last for a long time. I have had my current pair for at least 7 years now and the material is holding up and the colors on the straps are still bright. Easy to clean and very comfortable. They conform to the shape of your foot. They are not too expensive which makes it even nicer, but if you take good care of them, they last a long time!"
182180,1,I have been buying these flip flops for years! These are the only ones I'll wear. They have excellent arch support and are always comfy in between my toes from the second I put them on new! I highly recommend them!!!!
144787,1,"These are definitely the best Uggs to be created yet. I love my Uggs and currently have & pair, including my Bombers. I didn't buy them from here....but the review is still neccesary. Uggs never disappoint, and these are no exception. I love the leather on them the most, that's what drew me to them. Every winter I wear a pair of Uggs instead of snowboots and get mad every time. But I am not the only one! Over here in Boston, MA every girl you see is in a pair of Uggs, in ankle deep snow.....I know their toes are cold like mine because the fabric of the boots got wet and now is soaking through the sheepskin. LOL But we keep doing it. Well now I won't have that problem. I wore my Bombers out in the snow 3 times already and I am sooooo happy with them. I got home and my feet were till warm and toasty. Not to mention I don't have to wait for them to dry out to wear them again. Yay!!Oh, and for all the people who have never worn Uggs before.....They run big. I am a size 9/10 in shoes...so I usually have to purchase an 8/9. Happy Shopping!Kisses and Good Luck!"
94797,0,....but my wife reports that it does not fil her foot very well. It is the smallest 5.5 shoe she has ever had....
355502,2,I bought the shoe and they are ok but they are NOT Stan Smiths. Just a bland old no name shoe.
250874,1,"I have had a pair of these since I was an electrician in the US Navy. When I wear out the sole, usually the rest of the boot has been through enough to warrant a new pair. The last pair made it over six years. While I was an electrician, these boots made the difference between life and death when I was shocked from the 450V distribution bus. I didn't even get hurt too bad. The only complaint I would lodge about the new pair that I just bought is that the tongue doesn't have the same double layer of leather like the last pair, right at the top of the tongue. Because it is only a single layer, it doesn't lay as flat against my shin and will take a while longer to ""train"" to lay flat. Other than that, the boots are of superb quality."
27552,1,"I'm the type of woman who likes the way heels look, but hates how they feel. This shoe gives a little added height without all the pitfalls of wearing a heel. Despite what others are saying, I found these ran about a 1/2 size large and had too much space at the heel where my heel would slide. I ended up returning the first pair and ordered a 1/2 size smaller...problem solved. Also, I wouldn't call these a day to day shoe since they seem to be prone to scuffs. The width works well for me, I'm between a reg./wide width. Pretty comfortable for the most part, however your feet may tire if you wear these all day. The pads of my feet became sore after a long day's work, but a great shoe for dinner or a night out."
363843,1,I would be very greatful if u can let me know if the white chucks is one size bigger then nornal sizing cause I didnt see the remarks like on the black ones.Thanks
196039,0,"Great cushioning and overall looks good. However, they run a bit short in length for me and like other here, the top band is uncomfortable and rubs the top of your toes. They need to lengthen the piece between your toes and the would be more comfortable. Had to wear them for a week to see if they became more comfortable and they did not. I would like to return them, but cannot after wearing them outside. Try on in a store before you buy."
56241,1,"This is the only way to shop!! The shoes were great, they fit, and we had them in a couple of days!! I could not find these red Keds in any stores near us so I went to Amazon and found them in seconds. We had them so quick-I was shocked!!! Thanks Amazon!!"
124766,1,Amazon made purchasing this product easy. I had a lot of trouble finding a company that would ship these shoes to Australia.The product was exactly what I wanted and shipment was less than a week. Fabulous!In future Amazon will be my first stop when buying anthing on the internet.
126470,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
291521,1,The product was excellent but the ship date was longer than expected. I think that before you actually pay for the item that the expected ship date should be available.
316329,0,These moccasin's are really very cute but they run much bigger than the actual size. I ordered a size 5 for my daughter and they were nearly a size 6 - 6 1/2. I had to return them because that was the smallest womens size they carried. I would purchase again but not sure how to order the next pair.
56678,1,The Ked Champion is what I hoped it would be and I was/am very satisfied.
286246,1,"The UGGS I ordered came quickly, were quality material and the right color. I bought them for my daughter who is in college.This is her third pair.The first pair were stolen! The second pair wore extremely well and were very comfortable.She still has them but wanted a different color."
122175,2,These shoes are very pretty but they do not run true to size. I ordered 1/2 size larger to wear with thicker trouser socks. The shoe literally slipped of my foot.
194696,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
370001,1,"These are the required boots for the ASU in an airborne unit. They looks sharp right out of the box and they fit comfortably. Go to their website for sizing information if you're curious, they come in a variety of widths to fit everyone. Splendid boots."
215319,1,"I've been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon. They, of course, had it and i ordered it immediately. It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove."
59330,1,"Worked out of the box, used them for a few days on the treadmill, but probably wasnt needed. I have been using them for the weekly Treks here at Mission Peaks in the Bay Area, CA, which has pretty good uphills. No complains so far.Rated 4 only for the fact that the heels could use a little more padding - the heel of the shoe is hard which is good for support but not too good when you are walking up-slope. Also have been wearing 2 socks for better grip and to provide more cushion for the heels."
103067,1,"My daughter always had problems with shoes that have straps on them as they are so tight that they leave a mark on her foot and extremely uncomfortable. This ballet slipper is great because it is comfortable, it fits right and the strap is sturdy enough that the shoe won't slip out during dance class but not so tight that it hurts her. Am very happy with this product."
49869,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
284564,1,"I was anxious to get my first pair of thigh high boots. Didn't want to spend a LOT, and ended up not having to, thanks to Amazon.com.I was worried the boots were going to look diff than the pics and a wrong size or a defect...but I got expedited shipping the next day, and to my awe, the boots fit well. (tip: order one size up...especially if you want to wear thicker stockings or socks...I wear size 9, so I got a size 10). They are manmade material, but doesn't look tacky. I got Black PU, I think. I might get these in the black patent leather now :) !!! Only thing is I have LONG legs and thin calves, and the boots look a lil' as if they fit a more muscular or filled-out woman, but if you're like me, you can just push the boots down a bit for a slouchy-boot look and it works great! everyone will love them...fierce!"
13508,1,"They were a last minute Christmas gift. They came so quickly, the size was normal, the color fun, he loved them."
332415,0,"Main issue I have is with sizing. I ordered EE width. What that translated into is W. While these are slightly wider than the last wide shoe I tried on, they are definitely not extra wide.As to construction, they feel like cheaply made shoes. It's as if they were ""made in China"". Oh wait, they are ""made in China"". Perhaps that explains everything."
192330,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
171366,1,"Love these shoes! I recently purchased a pair in green and loved them so much that when i saw they were on sale at Amazon for 50% less than I paid for the first pair elsewhere, i HAD to have them!"
140960,0,This slipper is great for around the house. Offers no support but is a soft and comfy slipper.
83145,1,"My Reef sandals really ROCK! They're cool, comfortable, affordable and most importantly, they do NOT hurt my feet. I'd never been able to wear 'flip-flops' because I would inevitably have to change shoes after a few minutes. The design and workmanship of Reef make them the only flip-flop/sandals I can wear for hours on end and never be uncomfortable. I highly recommend them and will be purchasing more in the future!"
171475,1,i purchased the first pair in the gold. i found i could walk forever in these shoes. at 70 yrs. that is saying a lot. so then i just bought this pair in black. great price too. my friends are buying them online as well. the only problem is getting all the colors in your size but everyone is patient. i think the next might be brown or beige or white. i am going to take them with me when going on a trip. they are easy to remove at the airport going to security which is a problem with some shoes at my age. love them. i shouldn't write this because everyone will buy the shoes. that's okay. enjoy them as much as i do.
312908,1,"Ok I have to say these shoes are UGLY!!! My husband can't understand why I bough these he says I have the prettiest shoes he's ever seen and now.......Well here is the reason I read the reviews and decided to take a chance.I spend the whole day on my feet in and outdoors my home, and every day I would go to bed sooo tired my feet and back hurt and I worked with my most comfortable shoes. Now with my beach Crocs I can go all day and not feel so tired at night and definitely my feet don't hurt and neither does my back.These are house shoes I wouldn't be caught dead with them out of the house, but I have to say I love them and when I am home never take them off. Definitely a great buy!"
209208,1,Bought these for my son and they are your basic Ariat boots. These are a lot more durable than the comparable Justin roper. These boots have become the boot of choice for my sons and myself.
151017,1,"This is the 2nd pair of these same shoes I've purchased (from Amazon), and I love them! They fit just as expected, are lightweight, and have a really versatile color. Since they're a neutral color, I can wear them with both casual clothing and slightly nicer clothes like khakis with an untucked polo. I may even buy another pair in 3 or so years when this pair wears out!"
43252,1,As someone with problems with pronation - these sneakers have been great. My orthodics fit in them perfectly.I actually picked these sneakers before I went to the foot/knee dr - and when I went to see him he looked at my feet and said 'Oh the 854s - perfect'.
379919,1,"Because I'm doing my first ever musical this summer, I needed an affordable character shoe (in case I don't do any more musicals) that was comfortable enough to dance in. The price for this was great, and it's a super comfortable shoe. I usually cannot stand heels, but the heel on this shoe is so low and sturdy, you hardly notice it. I'm usually an 8.5 or 9, so I ordered a 9 and 9.5 to test out. The 9 fit lengthwise, but the toe area was tight, so I decided to stick with the 9.5 and put in a grip for the heel to keep it from slipping. I advise to order a couple sizes (the returns and shipping are free!) so you can test them out and make sure you get a good fit. Also, maybe trying out a wider size could help with the tightness around the toe area.Overall, a good buy if you need a comfortable dancing shoe for some occasion!"
193466,1,"I've gotten many compliments on these shoes! I love how they look, they are made of a soft material so they are comfortable, but still cause sore feet after shopping all day in them. But that's the cost of looking cute!"
342297,0,"They were narrow, like European Shoes. Buy a wider width and a half-size larger. If you have a high instep, do not buy these. They are well made but not for me. I had no trouble returning them. The vendor was fine."
197281,0,"I purchased from the photo. was in a hurry that day. Glad they where the low ones he wanted. novelty item. My son wanted them , he is 30 yrs old. A fun item he used to have many years ago. the size recomendations was correct. 1/2 size smaller was just right.... Not the Hi Tops they state in the add."
101746,1,"The quality is exactly the same as the ones that we purchase at the dance school for almost a quarter of the price. My daughter has been using the Capezio line of Ballet Shoes ever since she started dance and we have found them to be very sturdy and long lasting. All my daughter cares about really is that they are cute, of course :)"
5479,1,These slippers were a Christmas present for a friend. She had requested them through my son. She loved them and I thought they looked really cozy.
338569,1,These shoes were exactly what I was looking for. The price was the best I've seen anywhere. I couldn't be happier.
305570,1,"I've been a sales representative for over 20 years. During that time, I've probably owned more than 20 pairs of Rockport Prowalkers. The main reasons are comfort, support and durability. When I can afford it, I'll buy one pair for everyday use and one for church. When the everyday pair wears out, I'll start wearing the church pair and buy a new one.I used to buy expensive leather dress oxfords for work. I liked the way they looked, but my work shoes tend to take a beating. I was having to resole them once or twice a year. The Prowalkers are more comfortable and last longer. They're not cheap, but they're worthy the money.As long as they make them, I'll be buying them."
71968,1,"I coach soccer and have very wide feet (EEE). Finding affordable wide cleats is not easy, most companies don't make them anymore. The ones that do, charge too much. So I often have to settle on regular width cleats. I try to lace them loose so they won't kill my feet, but they often do.I won't spend big bucks on any cleats because over the last 13 years I've found that soccer cleats at any price just don't last. They come apart regardless of cost, quality, or manufacturer. Regardless of company, most cleats these days a junk. So why spend a lot of money?So, I was seeking affordable, wide cleats. I didn't care who made them as long as they were wide. Then I found these Zephz Wide Traxx soccer cleats.Although I need EEE width, I could only order a EE width Zephz Wide Traxx for my length cleat. I figured what the heck, EE is better than regular width. But the cleats I got actually wear like a EEE cleat. They feel great. My feet don't hurt at all. Mission accomplished.I've only worn them for one season so far. I know these are Chinese built, and don't expect much in terms of quality, but so far they've held up. We'll see how long they last.For now, my feet are comfortable, and it didn't cost a fortune, so I'm happy."
96483,1,"They did the trick. They are very waxy so they are more rigid than the non waxed laces, if that's what you want. But they are a solid, reliable product thus far. Have used them for about two months now."
300856,1,These make wonderful Taekwondo mat shoes. They decrease mat friction and still allow you to see your foot positions. They pack easily. My new one's are my 3rd pair.
82849,0,"umm..these sandals are comfortable but kind of big..I selected the right size but it was kind of big..but it's not too bad. overall, good quality and comfortable :)"
324999,1,"These shoes are very classy, yet very casual. Don't buy thinking you can wear these w/ dress slacks. Put them on w/ some khakis or jeans and you'll look great and feel better (they're super comfortable). I can't really comment on durability as I've only had them for a few months, but no problems whatsoever so far."
264516,1,"This is by far one of the top 3 most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, and certainly the nicest looking of them. I wore these every day for 6 months while working a job that had me walking for most of the day, and I have to say that these shoes saved my feet. On the days that I wore my other pair of shoes, my feet killed by the end. On the days that I wore these, no pain. I cannot stress enough how amazingly comfortable these are. They wore out in about 7 months, which is a bit fast for a pair of shoes (especially from Rockport), but I feel that considering how much I walked in those 7 months, and especially considering how comfortable they were, these shoes regardless have fantastic value to people to whom foot comfort is a major factor in choosing a pair of shoes."
232615,1,"Getting ready for winter, no snow yet so no opportunity to check if they are truly waterproof. Boots fit well, allow thick socks with usual size but extra wide. The sole felt a bit too flat until I put in my orthotics and now feel perfect. Orthotics fit well without needing to remove insole."
841,1,"I have an old pair and they are great in the winter and comfortable. SoooooI ordered a second pair for this winter and by the looks at the snow fall yesterday, it was a good choice."
382121,2,"While the length is great on this showhorn, and the metal is quality, the design is WORTHLESS. The part that goes behind your heel into the show is FLAT. Now, maybe there are some people whose feet are square on the heel, but mine are round, and my shoes are round at the heel, and this product is simply painful, and would destroy your shoes if you could suffer through the pain and actually used it regularly. Keep looking!"
83428,1,"Reefs don't disappoint. Whether wearing them in the city, on the beach or in the shower at school they are the perfect flip flop. Don't know why they aren't more available in stores any more."
382028,0,"I ordered a youth size 5, they were too small, we returned them. The next size seemed to be adult sizes and these boots didn't come in adult size."
63480,1,"I have had 4 pairs of the Altitude IV's. Please don't think they wear out fast, as they last longer than any other shoe I've had (New Balance, various off-brands). I used to kill New Balance shoes in 6-8 months, it takes about a year and a half for me to go through a pair of Altitude IV's. This is because I'm over 360lbs and really tend to beat the heck out of my shoes. I only replace them because I grind the tread off the soles carrying things (I work in audio). They're the most comfortable shoes I've ever had the pleasure of wearing, and will continue to have at least one spare pair on hand at all times."
301087,1,I wish they would list a size cross reference chart. Cause the boot says 6.5 US but 39 EUR which really equates to 8.5 US womens. Bought for my daughter for xmas is says toddler/little kid/big kid so I thought she petite 6 is her size perfect! NOT the shoes fit me & I am am 8.5 now I can even get her size for the same price. Great quality though just need to work out the sizing issue
371586,1,"I am providing an update to a negative experience I expressed in a previous review about this vendor. The vendor called me today to discuss my concerns. After our discussions, I felt extremely satisfied, that he is truly focused on his customers and provides a quality service. My situation was rectified and I am extremely satisfied and would not hesitate to order again from this vendor. It is wonderful to still have people who care about their product, reputation and their customer base"
276079,1,So far these hikers have performed well. I have a pair of low cut Hi Tec hikers as well and bought these for winter use. I've worn the low cuts hikers for several years and they have held up very well. I expect these new hikers will do the same.
32443,0,"These boots are not true red. They have a bit of dark brick or maroon tinge to them. I was disappointed in the color but my daughter did not notice. They seem comfortable and sturdy, although after just a few weeks there are a few spots where the color has flaked off, but I'm not surprised because they are being worn hard and often."
48072,1,These crocs are incredibly comfortable. I got them for my husband who steps heavily around the house and they have helped loads. The color is very versatile also. He loves them!
236226,2,"I looked long and hard for a pair of substantial and rugged-looking slip-ons and found these Roper shoes. I normally wear a 7.5 M, but I had to return them for a size 8. The first pair was too short and too tight, especially around the opening. It felt as if I had a rope around the ankles. The size 8 fit nicely, but the right foot was still a bit uncomfortable around the ankles, and I don't have unusual or deformed feet. I think they'll break in before long. These shoes are heavy like boots, handsome-looking, with textured leather. I like them alot even if the footbed can use more cushioning, but some low-profile shoe inserts will fix that. I suggest that if you have meaty feet (I have bony feet) that these are not for you because you'll have trouble getting them on and your ankles will feel constricted even with the padded opening. Other than that, the shoes will stay on securely and not feel like they're falling off when you're in motion, which is important if you live in a big city and never know when you'll need to run for it.Update: Dec. 17thNearly one year later, these shoes are still hard and uncomfortable. Granted I don't wear them everyday, but then who wears the same shoes everyday? I had to remove the inserts I added to improve the footbed because it elevated the foot and made the collar too tight around the ankle. I still wear them occasionally since I paid a pretty penny for them, but not if I expect to stand or walk for any length of time."
138552,1,"I bought these shoes according to the reviews... and the were big on me...I tested them for 2 clases and the feel verry nice but loose for my feet (I pulled the shoe laces very tight and the next time 2 socks)... I have regular feet not wide or narrow, but skinny... and folowing another reviews advise I purchased a size 8 and the were very loose with wise and big length wise... and since a friend in dance class wanted them (they fit her perfectely and she wears a size 7.5) I sold them to her for the same price that I bought them so I didn't loose any money :)This are dancing shoes they should fit like gloves almost!!! this shoes are very comfortable and flixible!!! they glide!!!I found on another site the following sizing chart which I think is very accurate I hope this helps!!!Street shoe 5.5-6 wears Sansha 6Street shoe 6-6.5 wears Sansha 7 This is what I should have bought!!!

301801,1,"I've worn this style of Clark's sandals for years and the quality is as always, excellent. They arrived quickly and were well packaged. I've bought items from this company before, through Amazon, and their customer service is terrific."
139946,1,"The sneakers arrived in a timely fashion, as promised. They were exactly what my son wanted. They were priced reasonably.They were of high quality and true to size. Thank you, Amazon"
33320,0,attractive espadrille wedge without so much heel height. the linen fabric is a little stiff. not the most comfortable naturalizer shoe.
354103,0,i like the shoes but they were the wrong size. i was wondering if you can send me a new pair out to me
194331,1,My 94 year old Mother loves them as a replacement for her old ones of different brand. Glad she is happy again.
320774,1,"I've been wearing my FatBaby boots nearly every day this winter. They're comfortable, durable and go with skirts and pants. Great buy!"
123467,0,"These boots are well made and comfortable. They are reasonably warm, OK down to maybe -10 F, and waterproof as advertised. The zippers work really well.They are great for mud, snow and slush. However, the soles let go entirely as soon as they encounter any ice. My ordinary shoes perform far better. Now I have the choice of dry feet or broken bones."
135942,1,I like this product because it was not used.Good product and cheaper than the official site.that is it
10115,1,"These boots worked perfectly for my son. They are very well made. They are a great color. They are a little heavy, but that's probably because of the sturdy construction. He has worn them several times already. I would recommend these boots."
22182,1,"I had this shoe for 2 years and are very comfortable.Wore them for Beach,play and lot of things.Now colour is slowly coming out. I can polish and wear them again."
189161,1,"This shoe is a great court shoe for someone who needs alot of support esp. for a high arch. Unfortunately, they were a bit too big; I wear Thorlo socks which have a great of padding and when I sized up to allow for this, they still were a bit too big. They run big so take that into consideration when purchasing these court shoes."
2689,1,I bought a pair of Altitudes about 8 years ago and loved them. I use them for hunting and Search & Rescue. They have held up well and are very comfortable. The new pair I just bought feel just as good and I should get many years out of them also.Dennis
333321,1,"I purchasd my first version of this boot in the late 1960's. It lasted forever. This version has a bit higher heel than I remember, but it is just as comfortable. The leather lining makes for an easy fit. For me there was no break in, when I first slipped it on it is like I'd worn the boots all my life."
42049,1,I got these a few weeks ago and have loved them. Good support in the arch and heel and no rubbing. The spikes are pretty sharp so they make good trail running shoes. You can take the spikes out with a key (provided) and they make good track shoes.
362109,1,"I haven't started working in these boots yet because I like them too much as casual boots. My girlfriend said they are her favorite pair on me. They have a nice dark brown/oiled look. Very comfortable. I have a wide foot and ordered a EE width and they were PLENTY wide. Great boots, will definitely order Double-H boots again."
196125,1,For the price I paid a really good price on a handsome shoe - they seem sturdy (early to tell to be honest) and look appropriately dressy so they can be worn with suit and can also be part of jeans attire. They seem perfectly comfortable. What else to say about a shoe?
328826,1,"I wish this shoe was still in production. I originally bought two pairs about 10 years ago when I used to skateboard. I don't skate anymore but I've wanted these shoes again ever since. They don't make shoes like this anymore, it's got more padding and comfort than any other shoe I've ever worn. I'm so glad to have these back on my feet and they are just as amazing as I remembered. I probably won't be able to get another pair after this so it will be a sad day when I have to retire this pair. Thankfully these shoes last forever, especially when you aren't using them for skateboarding."

83521,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
119747,1,"These were a purchase for my 13 year old granddaughter. Although I have not physically seen them because they live in VA and I in MN, she tells me that they are just what she wanted. Pleased with the ease of this transaction and the speed in which they were shipped to her. Thank you."
121491,1,"I am what most runners call a Clydesdale, tipping the scales north of 230 pounds. As a result my feet and joints take a real pounding (no pun intended). I run on tar (no concrete), wooded paths (dirt), and occaisionally a treadmill, and I have found that these shoes are ideal for me. I have mixed wearing Asics GT-2000 series shoes with various Nike, New Balance, saucony, reebok, and other stability oriented trainers for more than 20 years, and the GT-2000 series in unsurpassed in my view. While I have a tendency towards plantars fascitis, I have never experienced any bouts while wearing the Asics shoes. I also prefer the firmer feel of the Asics to some of the Nike Air shoes I have used in the past.as you can see, I am sold on these shoes. But make sure you try a pair on before you order them; I believe the reason they are so good for me is that they fit my feet well (I have a wide forefoot and narrow heels). They may not work for you. if not, I would suggest you try some new balance, as they come in various widths, and to me have a similar ""feel"" to these. Good luck"
285177,1,THE SHOES WERE DELIVERED SO MUCH EARLIER THAN THE EXPECTED DATE. GREAT JOB! MY SON LOVES IT SO MUCH FOR THE COMFORTNESS AND SHOWING OFF HIS BOOTS TO EVERYONE HE KNOWS. NO REGRETS AT ALL AND WORTH BUYING!
135939,1,Got this pair for my girlfriend as I got a pair myself for a themed party we had and well party is over and we are still rocking them
91075,1,This shoe has been a real asset in the snow and ice. The recommendation to buy 1/2 size larger was right on. Fit great with no break-in time.
18766,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
345926,1,Took the advice of other reviews of this product and ordered a half-size under my usual shoe size. Perfect fit.
165444,1,Love the shoes. I have this shoe in 5 colors. When I wanted a third WHITE pair could not find them on line at J. C. Penney's as I have in the past and could not find the white shoes on line at Easy Spirit. Amazon directed me to Shoemall.com where they had this shoe in about 18 different colors. Thank you Amazon!
66978,1,"Purchased for my daughter. She loves the sneaker, runs slightly larger than normal shoe size. I would order 1/2 size smaller."
307123,1,My husband loves these sandals. He likes canoeing and these sandals protect his toes and have a good grip for river walking.
155675,1,"LAST CHRISTMAS I ORDERED THIS BOOT AND NOW THIS YEAR THE PRICE HAS DOUBLED. I AM WISHING THAT I HAD ORDERED MORE THAN ONE PAIR. I WILL ORDER ANOTHER PAIR THIS YEAR. I LIKE THE SOLES AND HEELS ON THIS BOOT BECAUSE THEY LAST LONGER THAN MOST AND THIS IS THE FINEST LOOKING DRESS BOOT MADE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. IT IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE BOOT THAT I HAVE FOUND. YOU WILL GET SOME RESPECT WHEN YOU ARE SEEN IN THESE BOOTS. THESE BOOTS ARE ""BOSS"" TO SAY THE LEAST."
49045,1,these sandals are as comfortable as athletic shoes--great support in the heavily padded soles. why can't other shoe manufacturers give us shoes like this? i also love the style of the valerie and get compliments all the time. i own them in every combination and wear them almost every day
321098,1,"Highly recommeded. he price, quality, customer service, and the sizing chart were all excellent. I will buy them again here in the future."
39284,1,"This shoe has no ""break in"" period. This has to be one of the most comfortable shoes I have every worn straight from the box. I hope they hold up, seems to."
258994,1,"The tennis shoes arrived quickly. They fit, as always and arte a great value"
15652,1,"Beautiful quality shoes, perfect packaging. The size ran a little big but that is no big deal. Highly recommended."
131284,1,"Great work shoes that actually feel like tennis shoes. I've had these Danners for over a year and am going to purchase my second pair. I prefer the comfort of Telson over Acadia and other Danner LE shoes. Has a great tactical look, but doesn't really go well with class-a uniforms during formal events."
91456,1,These sandals are the most comfortable shoes I have worn in a long time. I have several pairs in different colors and practically live in them all summer. I would recommend them to anybody who wants a pair of sandals.
260953,1,My 23 y/o son asked for these for Christmas and he was ESCATIC! He loves them so I guess this would be a positive review! Shipping was fast and came in great condition.
167559,0,"These are really cute sandals, however a little uncomfortable for me since one of the straps catches my small toe, but that's probably just me since my small toe is REALLY small. I'm hoping there will be some give to the stap at least that's what I hope because I really like them and bought two pairs."
248689,1,"These are really Great boots,............ I would recommend these for any growing boy, or girl,............ Just buy a half size larger!!!!!!"
21501,1,That shoos one of the best I buy ever high quality almost I have it more than 24monthe and stile in good shape .
67194,0,"This shoe was so cute. I heard it ran big so I ordered a size 5 1/2 instead of 6. Unfortunately, they were still huge! Keds used to run TTS but, unfortunately, this seems not to be the case anymore. Too bad, because they are so cute."
259877,1,"Bought these for weight lifting, but find myself wearing them everywhere. What's not to love about a pair of Chucks? An American classic."
140347,1,It is hard to find small sizes in women's shoes anymore and I appreicate your carrying them. This is one brand that I really like and fits very well.
196883,1,Great boots and look good for my uniforms.These are the most comfortable boots I have ever owned.I usually wear an 8.5 and the 8 fit perfectly
325723,0,The shoes are ok for the price. The material looks a little cheap but they are comfortable. The sizing. You should get your street size. I am an 8.5 and I ordered 9 because of the reviews. They are a little bit big. :(
345764,1,love these shoes. no trouble with purchase. fit just perfect. love these shoes. love this brand. love this color. love
354480,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
247357,1,"I bought two pairs of these shoes, black croc and brown croc. They are so comfortable and I wear them so much that the black ones are nearly worn out and I will order another pair soon."
386366,0,"I usually wear 11.5, but it was a bit small for me.The product was good, so i will try 12."
37999,1,These shoes were ordered to replace a pair just like them so obviously I liked them originally and like them now also.
211495,1,"I love these shoes. I work in a place that has a professional dress code and I can't wear sneakers or shower type shoes. Recently my company instituted a fitness/walking program of 10,000 steps a day. The floors in my building are hard stone/granite and can be slippery when the humidity is high, so I needed a shoe with a rubber sole, looked professional and gave support and comfort... this shoe fit the ticket. The shoes are comfortable, very lightweight, well constructed and good value for my money. I would recommend them to anyone who walks or are on their feet a large percentage of the day.I'm thinking of getting another pair in an alternative color. I have seen these shoes in various mail order catalogs for about $10.00 more than from Amazon (and the vendor)."
90409,1,"I would rate the quality of this sandal excellent, but would have preferred a wider width, which NB is known for, than what I received. Maybe after I wear the sandals for a period of time they will widen out."
186539,1,The quality of this model is much better than their previous Propet Walker (which was very good). My Aunt loves the shoe and its ease of wearing.Amazon's delivery time was even better than promised.I do wish that a 6.5C was available.
110084,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
175329,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
16675,0,"The Copas are classic and are good shoes. The kangaroo leather gives a good touch on the ball.However, I found my pair were too long and too narrow for my wider-than-average foot. If you're over a size D width, you should find a shoes with a broader footplate.Durability of the shoe was a concern. I wore them for a year and half (not full time playing, either) and then they were certifiably worn out. I quickly wore a large hole into the size of the right shoe. Furthermore, the heel became stiff and gave blisters as the shoe aged. They're practically unwearable now.If you have a narrow foot, I recommend. Be careful if you have a wide foot. Also, take good care of the kangaroo leather - keep them clean and lubed up with lotion if you can in order to preserve their lifespan."
346592,1,"I was skeptical about the comfort level of these shoes, given their seemingly flat design. I was wrong! These shoes are very comfortable and supportive. I wear them all the time. Best casual sneaker! Great price."
236290,1,"Hi, I was looking for the shoes for my brother and I found I actually mostly like the color, but the price is ok. Only one problem I had because I did't know what the letters (ex: 4E, D) means so I suggest to add some explaining."
171190,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes you will ever own. I have tried similar shoes by other manufacturers (Merrell, Teva) and these beat those for comfort hands down. I liked these so much after the first day I wore them, that I promptly sat down and ordered three more pair.Truly a comfort plus shoe that offers great support. Please don't ever stop making these!!"
55560,1,I love my new red keds!!! They arrived right on time and are perfectly amazing!! Thanks to the great price I even ordered another color!
282294,0,"Somehow I don't feel comfortable when there are two belts or shoelaces not linked anywhere. Their width is not equal. So if I sew them on the shoes, that won't look nice. The shoes may not need a lace to tie tight. But to secure, the laces may still be needed. So I will return the shoes."
129087,1,"This is a GREAT boot. I've had to use them all day long in the rain and in blazing sun. Your feet will stay comfy through it all. Even in the mud, they seem self cleaning & maintain a clean polished look. I've ran in them and have never had any problems. Because of the lace and zip, they stay snug and really are wearable right out of the box. The boot knife is handy too! If I had to reach for something negative to say, I couldn't. It was even fast shipping and the company gave me a mail-in rebate for FREE 5.11 socks!"
177269,1,"Converse Chuck Taylor All Stars are not just a fashion statement. Back in the day, they were my choice of athletic footwear -- following in my father's footsteps -- while starting center on the high school basketball team. For a 6'2"" white guy with a moderate vertical leaping ability, I didn't have to worry about losing any spring in my step, and I always led stats in rebounds and blocked shots against players wearing the then-ubiquitous Adidas, Puma and Converse ""Dr. J"" hi-tops. In all fairness, and as a disclaimer, 80% of the opposing team members were white guys, too.Still, though I have absolutely no vertical leap left (hey. I graduated 24 years ago), I still wear these shoes, just because. Like one reviewer pointed out, they're a great conversation starter. Plus, they're as comfy as a second pair of feet.At the turn of the 20th to the 21st century, it appeared that there'd be NO Chucks left at all: The Massachusetts factory was closing down, and Chucks appeared to be going the way of acid-wash jeans. Fortunately (or, unfortunately, if you're a member of the garment workers' union), Converse went through some reorganization and now makes these overseas, presumably in China.Well, I'm boycotting the People's Republic of China, an anti-labor country that has helped more American CEOs bust unions than just about anyone else. Its own people are slave labor. Fortunately, I thought ahead, so when Converse was on the ropes, I went out to every shoe store around and bought up all the size 12 hi tops I could find. To be exact, 143 pairs -- a closet full. I've got 'em in white, optical white, green, red, basic black, navy blue, yellow, orange, you name it. Set me back $2700, but was worth every penny, knowing that American workers made them.I AM THE IMELDA MARCOS OF CONVERSE CHUCK TAYLOR ALL-STAR SHOES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But, if you're a newcomer to them, or missed the boat, I won't hate ya for buying these for yourselves. They are so cool, I'll look the other way.I have to look the other way myself: I buy the toddler sizes for my two wittle one. Aw!!!! :) At least I help keep American shoe store employees employed, if not factory workers."
140998,0,I really thought they would be exactly like the ones we had in the 70's. The toe grip on these shoes is not as large as the 70's ones/ Overall I still like them.
189772,1,"I buy these shoes for my daughter to wear for P.E., she love them! The soles are thick and sturdy, something the school wants the kids to have. This is our tried and tested tennis shoe we use year after year! My daughter is 7 years old and has no problem in wearing these shoes."
212355,1,These are very comfortable and durable. Bought for son who has outdoor job and his feet stay protected and warm.
237760,1,i have been using since four months. These are very comfortable it feels you smoothness to your feet while walking.Best worth for the price
163688,1,"Liked the sneakers, they were for my daugher who uses them to cheerlead in and she said that they were very comfortable. The price was right and I'm glad i was able to find them and purchase them."
37729,1,"Whilst delighted with the product once I had actually recieved them, some 3 weeks after I ordered them via you, I was really disappointed with the poor service that UPS provided. Having provided my vacation hotel as the shipping address UPS failed to deliver during the 2 weeks I was in the USA and then refused to re-direct the product to my home address in the UK at nil charge. Whilst I accept that the weather was bad for a couple of days in Denver UPS used it as an excuse for non-delivery every time I spoke to them, which was every day for the last 6 days of my vacation. Anyone would think they don't have snow in Colorado !!The main reason for calling UPS every day for 6 days was to get the ZIP code changed as the last 2 digits were transposed giving a shipping address of Tabernash and not Steamboat Springs. Every day UPS said they would change it but it never happened.I don't think you have a ZIP code filter / check process during your on-line order process for the shipping & billing address. Something that you should seriously consider as it would save a lot of hassle in the downstream delivery processes carried out on your behalf by agencies such as UPS."
190086,0,Bought these shoes as part of my daughter's school uniform. Good-looking all-white shoes are hard to find. These fit great and were perfect until she came home with the seams splitting after about 2 months. Don't know if she is just hard on them or if they are not made as well as they used to be. Might give them another shot with a second pair.
261143,1,"I ordered these shoes for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them. They look great and are true to size. He said he wishes these shoes had more arch support because he has to wear insoles, but that is typical of this particular shoe."
9704,2,These shoes lasted a few months of intermittent use before falling apart. They were never comfortable from the onset and never broke in...just became more unbearable with time. I've used Danner boots for years but have now switched to Lowa...the best brand in my opinion.
307940,1,"This pair of converse was just what I expected; they were one my son's Christmas presents. The colors available were more varied than those I'd seen in local stores and the price was better. This item arrived sooner than promised, too. Needless to say, my son was pleased."
316064,0,"I love the previous pair of janet sandals that I purchased about 6 years ago, but the newer ones were not true to size overall for me. i was saddened to return what I thought was a welcomed replacement for my very worn favorite."
115422,1,I need a pair in every Colorado. I wore sauconys in high school and I still love them now. they run a half size small so if u want a roomier fit buy up a half size. I love it
41734,0,"1. The colour of the shoes I got is Silver/Silver/Royal, I like it very much. But the acture colour of the shoes is much darker than the picture. So I think chromatic aberration is a serious problem. I love the colour appeared on the picture.2. The size of the shoes is smaller, so I have to return it to champs for a larger one. So please order a larger size(+0.5 at least) than what you wear usually3. The shoes are light and soft, which earning points for it. Otherwise,I think 2-stars score is exact."
264099,0,"Unless you are blessed with slender, narrow feet, this beautiful DOnald Pliner sandal will likely cause a great deal of discomfort. How I wish that I had those slender and narrow feet!"
304088,1,"They fit so nice, they match my outfits, I love them. they work so well, I'll just keep them till they die."
218892,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
18506,1,We pretty much live in flip flops 9 months a year. These look great and seem to be wearing very well.
311596,1,"Hi, I'm from Colombia, it is the first time that I buy in Amazon and the product that I received was in conditions excelents, I'm very excited with the product !!! Timberland Men's Euro Hiker Boot,Grey/Grey,7 M US"
3852,1,"The person I purchased them for feel they are very comfortable. I was worried at first with buying boots from on line, but it turned out ok."
64656,1,"Great quality for the money. Hate the heaviness of most tennis shoes, these are light weight and good support without making my feet feel heavy"
325685,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
67218,0,"This shoe was so cute. I heard it ran big so I ordered a size 5 1/2 instead of 6. Unfortunately, they were still huge! Keds used to run TTS but, unfortunately, this seems not to be the case anymore. Too bad, because they are so cute."
187787,0,"I love Propet shoes but these were not my style. They are clunky compared to what I have ordered before, maybe I can break them in this summer."
283407,1,"Received in a short amount of time after ordering. Packaged well, there was no shipping damage. Well made with a good and comfortable fit."
277829,1,"These have been great hiking boots. The waterproofing has worked perfectly so far, and they've been comfortable, even on long hikes."
236818,1,"The brand ""Keds"" speaks for itself. But I got it at a great price and came in just a few days. Like the fact they come in different widths."
307259,1,"I love these sandals.- They are very rugged.- The snug, secure fit over the foot and around the ankle paired with the unique toe space (see caveat below) matches my preferred fit for a shoe.- The foot bed has just that right amount of cushion and comfort while still feeling solid and stable. They really hit the ""magic"" mix on this.- The bolstering around the heel and arch eliminates side to side movement creating a very stable feel about these shoes.- The hybrid nature of these shoes causes me to reach for them FAR more often than my sandals or hiking/walking shoes. Have you ever tried to run in sandals? How long does it take to dry hiking shoes after a wade?Now to my small caveats:1. It may be just that I have an abnormally tall big-toe, but I could stand just one more millimeter of space in the toe well over the top. In fact, the first time I bought a pair of these, I had to return them after a couple days because my toenail just-barely touched the top of the toe well and made me nuts. Eventually I found a pair that had just that tiny bit of extra space and I snatched them up. This brings me to my second caveat.2. You wouldn't expect it, but the size variation across styles and even within the same style is pretty significant. I was sure I would never be able to own a pair of Keens because of the toe fit thing. When I found them on sale recently, I decided to have another try. To my surprise, I found a pair of original Newport in 10.5 (my size) that fit AWESOME with no toe problems...But they were leather, which I didn't want, and they were just the most ridiculous light green color. Next I tried the H2s with nylon straps. The first 10.5 was way too small, for fun I tried two other 10.5s, all of which felt like they were different sizes. Then I tried an 11. These were too big by a long-shot. I was ready to leave when I tried an 11.5 on a whim and they fit perfectly...I think you need to try these shoes on before you buy. I buy everything I can online, but in the case of Keen shoes, I would be really hesitant."
342932,1,"I love these shoes. I am so pleased that I will be ordering another pair because they are so difficult to find. I want to make sure I have a pair when the pair I have wears out.Thank-you,Kathleen morin"
357054,0,"I like the shoe--takes time to break in so shoe begins to fit the mold of your foot, like all Capezios. Comfortable. Really bought this shoe for everyday wear, since I like taupe to elongate your leg and foot. Makes you feel like a dancer!"
380656,1,"The shoes are comfortable, I've use them a couple of times now, but don't now if they will last many games, the material made with looks cheap. I buy it for the maker's name so I'm hopping will last at least the season. They are well cushioned and I have no regrets.I have big, wide feet so my concern was that these will not fit me, but they are OK. I was off the fields for 3 years now and I wanted some shoes to start my ""comeback"" so instead of spikes I buy these, I recommend this if you want some ""cheap"" shoes to start playing again."
38526,1,this is a great product. i would buy this product again. i have no regrets on making this purchase. dj
244356,1,"The sneakers were all that I expected. They were comfortable, well structured, pleasing to look at, and I believe long lasting. I am totally satisfied with the shoes."
21991,1,I bought these shoes to help with a problem I'm having with pain near the ball of my foot. The problem is not existent while wearing these shoes! The way these shoes feel does take a little getting used to...they will actually change the way you walk. There is a lot of arch support. I tried changing shoes as often as possible and nothing really seemed to help...I decided to buy these (I had tried them on at a local retailer first) because of how different they felt...if you've never tried an Earth shoe before I'd recommend trying them on somewhere before buying. I normally take a size 8.5 and I had to return for a size 8...apparently they run a little big. The shoe does seem to be made very well and I will most likely buy another pair.
364079,1,I bought these for the sole purpose of weightlifting. Excellent ankle support and flat bottoms without much heel make these an ideal shoe in the gym. These shoes provide very firm footing and i would highly recommend them to bodybuilders on a budget.
107626,0,"I ordered the plus calf, and was shipped the regular, so heads up on that. Otherwise they looked nice, a bit narrow in the foot though. I'm going to try to find them in the actual plus calf."
333802,0,The shoes were to tight and didnt fit well at all. Which is disapointing beause I loved how the shoe looked
255070,1,"I wore Clarks desert boots for years, and I bought this pair for my son who is 24, he wears them every day and loves the comfort and good looks. He and I highly recommend them. They do run big so get a size or half size smaller then your normal shoe size."
197084,1,"I have a spinal deformity called spinal stenosis in my lumbar region. I also have broken my neck, and it is now fused from C2-T1. These make it possible, for me to wear boots still. It actually makes them easier to put on, than other types of shoes I have to bend over to tie. These hooks eliminate that problem completely, so I love them."
368655,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
171062,1,"I bought the Dark Brown ones. This is my first Cowboy boot ever. I was looking at Laredos, Tony Lama, Justins, etc. These looked the nicest and had the best reviews out there. They were all unbiased and actually dead on. They came in a little before the estimated delivery date too.It was hard walking in a boot at first when I am usually wearing sneakers or shoes. Its definitely worth it. It took me a day or two to adjust. These boots are the most comfortable footwear I have ever owned. They are soft and don't hurt your back when walking. Its like walking on air with these. I thought I would need a wider boot, but the regular did me just fine.If your looking for a stylish boot or a cowboy boot, I'd recommend these without a doubt. I love em. Worth every penny."
113619,1,"Based on feedback from others that I read on your site, I decided to order a size up for my daughter. She is usually a 9 or 9 1/2, but we went with a 10 and they are a perfect fit. She loves the shoes - great ventilation on the court. She says she can feel the air coming into the shoe when she runs. Nice looking, too. Would definitely recommend!"
246804,1,this is a great product. i would buy this product again. i have no regrets on making this purchase. dj
201361,1,"These companies have been in existance for over 50 years for a reason. Quality and performance. Sadly, of these icons, Sperry is made in China, but the quality seems to remain. You have to love the different flavors that are available for for this iconic style of shoe. These are the shoes I wear the most...casual, yet classy enough to go anywhere and not feel underdressed!"
187470,1,These boots were a birthday gift for my granddaughter...I'm not sure if she has taken themoff as it appears they are always on her. So very happy about this purchase.
14846,1,"This line of boots came highly recommended to me, I second that opinion. Used them for 4 days straight on an AZ dove hunt. Outside temps ranged from mid 80s to 115 degrees. Sure it was hot but my feet were comfortable and after being on my feet all day long, I didn't have any complaints. They did take a couple of hikes prior to my hunt to break in, but they softened up quite nice. Boot has great traction on various terrain. Quality built. Would recommend to anyone. I have the uninsulated model but you should consider insulated ones if you hunt in cooler climates than I do."
211702,1,"Love these shoes. This is my second pair. I have wide feet and these shoes were comfortable from day one. I didn't have to ""break them in"" like I usually do with any new shoes I get. The only problem I found with them is the laces could be a bit longer, but that is a minor thing compared to the comfort. I stand all day at my job and good shoes are very important in how your legs feel by the end of six hours."
235515,1,Kenneth Cole shoes are the most comfortable and casually classy shoes. I'd reccommend to anyone. These are VERY comfortable on the foot. at 6'4 250 its rare to find shoes that both look good and dont kill my feet. Every KC shoe ive ever had has been all aces.
181028,1,My first pair of croc pumps I think they are very very comfortable I got the wide width the slingback is comforable I would diffently buy them again or refer them to my family and friends you will be pleased.
273700,1,Perfect shoes for a demanding person. One of the best purchases made so far in amazon. For the price they were a steal. High quality leather and high quality craftsmanship. Highly recommend these shoes for both casual and suit.
339500,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes I've had in a very long while, and they fit like a glove! I haven't owned a pair of converse in well over 3 years, and I'm so happy I decided to buy a new pair. Will definitely keep buying from all-star for a long time to come."
377765,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
191108,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
197726,1,"I've always been sceptical when buying any clothing and footwear online. I've always wanted a pair of Chuck's. Got these, tried them on and I love them!"
142848,1,"These shoes are really cute! When I first bought them, I was a little unsure about the top being clear and how they would look on my feet, but as time went on, they grew on me, and now I really like them. They are a wedge, so they are easier to walk in than a stiletto heel. And they have a unexpected hole cut out in the wedge, which, one: is super cute, and two: gives the shoe a stiletto appearance. I had to wear these shoes for a couple months before they where broken in and not given me blisters anymore, but it was worth it, because now they are comfortable and I can wear them all the time!"
150429,1,I like the shoe. it is nice and basic which is what i was looking for. I ordered a 10 N and it is not really that Narrow across the arch. but i put an insole in it and its is great.
73934,1,"Super cute. I almost feel that the classic crocs are the best of them. Just be sure to get the right size and know they run BIG. They are a summer staple. Easy to get on and off. Can get wet, super easy to clean and withstand a ton of abuse. I will be buying the next size up for next spring / summer."
214348,1,"These boots are Awesome!!! Very warm, stylish, true to size, and very comfortable. Can't beat the price either. Perfect for Minnesota winter."
10446,0,"I bought these slippers as a Christmas present for my sister. I was really disappointed in the condition that the slippers arrived in. The box was so crushed either from insufficient packaging protection during shipping or they were plucked from inventory in that condition. In either case, I couldn't wrap the box and had to throw the slippers in a gift bag. Since Capezio is a good brand for ballet slippers, it would have been nice to have given her the gift in the box."
257153,1,"These shoes are inexpensive, light weight, and very comfortable.They were hard to get on at first. There is a loop on the tongue that holds the laces... I relaced the shoes without using the loop and they went on much easier.I'm happy with them."
228763,1,"I've been looking for red chucks for a while now. I love these!! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though, they run quite large."
68359,0,"Shoe looks a bit more boot like than I anticipated.Fit wise, it runs true to size. Top of the shoe rubs my ankle bone some and is uncomfortable; I hope that goes away over time as the shoe breaks in. I probably wouldn't buy this shoe again, but will wear it until they are worn out."
175199,2,"The last Naturalizer Navy Women's Scout sandals I bought were well made. These had cheaper quality leather, thinner soles, and no elastic in the back of the heel, which I need for my narrow heels. I was disappointed. Especially, since I paid $18.00's in postage and ordered the exact sandal and size as before."
181682,1,I LOVE my Sperry's! I had a hard time finding them in stores around town. I found them right away at Amazon.com! Thanks for having my size!
10686,1,just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo. I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box. They feel like I already broke them in. These are going to be great for pants or skirts. I'm very happy with them.
183889,1,"I had heard from so many people that these were the most comfortable shoes ever, so I had to try them. I was going to order them from amazon and was a little intimidated by the size options. I went to a store to try them on and I am glad I did! The fit is very different and I definitly needed the help of a sales person. I ended up with a whole size bigger than I thought I was. They are very comfortable and I am happy with them so far, but am glad I didn't order online because I would have had to exchange for a bigger size."
350429,0,"I ordered these over a week ago after a long search for inexpensive Gore-Tex boots. They are comfortable, offer no pinch spots for my medium-volume feet, and performed well on a five-mile hike in 20 degree weather.I have two gripes - one, after such a short period, I've already noticed slight separation between the leather upper and the rubberized outer sole. Secondly, my sturdy-looking laces have already begun to fray and weaken in one spot.Both of these issues are minor, though, and easily repairable. I'm pleased with their waterproof qualities so far, and found nothing comparable in their price range."
262470,0,Ordered for a Christmas Gift for a friend. But product looks fine. But Timberland does not make a wide enough width for my feet.
126919,1,They feel comfortable and true to size. The black and white go with everything. I'll be buying this same pair again.
191774,1,This leather sandal is so cute yet it is sturdy and very comfortable. I lead a very active life and need comfortable sandals when walking my dog on nice warm days. I never mind spending my money on something I will be able to enjoy for years.
174234,1,Just purchased those shoes for my brother andhe is satisfied above and beyond.A very light and comfortable feeling he told me.New Balance were and always will be the best sport shoes for me.You wan't be sorry for purchasing this particular one.5 stars !
7191,1,"These kicks is tight. I was strollin' down the block, and some female was all like, &quot;YO! Those kicks is tight!&quot; I was all like, &quot;What you know about these kicks? I gotta show you wassup!&quot; Then later on in the day, we hooked up. So this fresh gear is where its at."
188511,1,first of all these boots are very comfortable and have great support. the only thing is they seem to run 1/2 a size too big and that is with hiking socks on. I'm not returning them because it's really not that bad but just something to think about before ordering
269162,1,"This was a gift for my father on fathers day. He tells me they are very comfortable. So I guess according to him, these are very good sneakers."
160882,1,"I was introduced to Converse All-Star's (Chuck's) two years ago and they are the best shoes I have ever owned. Before I knew about Chuck's, I would have multiple pairs of sneakers for different activities, now I have one! They have excellent foot support all the way up the ankle, the only downside is that the soles have no arch and if you are not already flat footed, they will probably make you that way. They are great shoes!"
188609,1,"I was looking for a reasonably priced, nice looking, functional boot for casual wear and I think I have found it. Like many others, I would much rather buy a product produced here in the USA, but that is near impossible these days. With that in mind I did a lot of research and found that some American brand name importers hold their offshore builders to a higher standard than others, and I think Timberland just may be one that does. I have a large, wide foot and most of the time I have to buy a size longer even in a wide to insure enough room. I took a chance and ordered my exact size in wide and to my pleasant surprise, these fit almost perfect... perhaps a little tight, but that will get better over time. These boots are very comfortable and have better than average support, the leather is well treated and is waterproof for casual forays into water or snow. The real test though, is wether or not they hold up. I tend to be hard on shoes so look for an update if these fall apart. I would have given these five stars if they were made here in the USA."
87406,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
201548,1,Fabulous! Just as described and arrived in a very timely manner! Would buy from this seller again!
246223,1,"This is a great shoe once we got the size right. The hassel was in returning the first pair and getting a smaller size. Finally after a month I have the right shoe in the right size. When I sold this shoe, I wore it on a daily basis and had it in at least 4 colors. I would like a local distributor where I can purchase this same shoe but be able to try it on first. If you have that information it would be great otherwise I'll have to keep trying to locate one that does. Thank you, C. Martin"
119493,1,"buen articulo llego a la fecha sin ning&uacute;n problema 100% confiable el vendedor,operacion realizada sin ningun tipo de incoveniente el producto llena mi perspectiva"
123918,1,This shoe is like walking on pillows. They can be worn with just about everthing. I have had 4 pair over the years.
379912,1,fast delivery and brand new! in box and should order in 1/2 size bigger im a 7 so 7 1/2 fit just great
237936,1,"I'm happy I was able to get this shoe in a Narrow, they fit snuggly but the leather will stretch."
207300,1,"Very comfortable shoe with soft leather uppers. Awesome old-school styling that looks good with jeans or khakis or whatever. The only issue I had is that they seem to run about 1/2 to one full size too small, and they're cut narrower than the typical running/hiking shoes I'm used to. After awhile, these start to feel sorta tight on my feet, and my feet are not wide either. IMO, just order at least 1/2 to one full size bigger than your foot size and they should be ok."
322234,0,not bad sneakers. however the mesh is complete mesh all the way through. there is nothing but mesh under mesh.
92394,1,"These are really cool shoes, the materials are cheap, they don't lace up high enough. If you're wearing them casualally buy them! But for basketball, you may as well go to walmart and buy some basketball shoes they are awful"
346340,1,These are classic Converse shoes. They arrived quickly. The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform.
274404,0,"I purchased these on the basis the description stated they were waterproof. After 5 minutes walking in wet grass, my feet were soaking wet. On the other hand, these boots are extremely comfortable - when dry. If your looking for nice pair of hiking boots, under dry conditions, these are a great choice. Wet = 1 star, Dry = 5 stars, Overall = 3 stars."
37909,2,Never wore them because they smelled like moth balls. The odor was so strong that my whole house started to smell like moth balls. Had to return them.
57915,1,"I've been eyeing the graphite colored Keds for awhile now and I am not disappointed that I finally bought them!I am normally a size 9 to 9.5 in shoes, and because of the loose fit from a previous pair of size 9.5 Keds, I went with a size 9. So they fit perfectly. I've worn them walking around the city a few times and have had no pressure points/no blisters/no sore spots. That's the ultimate test for me--comfort in walking. Well, they definitely passed the test."
29669,0,I'm sure they will work fine for what I am using them for. What else can I really say about a pouch?
46289,0,"I was very happy to purchaed a pair of Bally shoses in great price. However, It was disappointed that I have to return the shoses because the size are not the same as standard shose size. So, if you are interested Bally shoses, make sure to double check the size chart for Bally shoses."
246044,1,"I wear a 5 or 5 1/2, so it's difficult for me to find shoes. I've also had foot surgery, so I want and need something that's comfortable. These shoes are great. They're small and comfortable for short and medium stints. They're not great if you're going to be on your feet all day. (I've wished I hadn't been wearing them on a couple of my all-day shopping sprees.) They also come in a variety of colors, which is very nice. This brown was a nice, dark brown - a neutral brown, unlike some of the lighter, redder, more milk chocolatey ones. They have a shelf life, though. The cushioning wears out, so I've learned when to call it quits and order another pair."
225337,0,The shoes were not the size that I thought I was ordering. I wanted a women's size. These will be sent back.
340943,1,I have been using this product for a very long time. Fit and quality is excellent and they are true to size. Amazon offered the lowest price I have ever received on this particular item. Very satisfied with my purchase.
371005,1,"I bought this pair of converse for my daughter, and she loves them. They are so comfortable to wear and great quality as well."
193028,1,"Love the style of this sandal. Not my first pair. Very comfortable, good fit in the size I need. The only problem I had was that the color was not what I thought I was ordering, but would like to have more colors in the same style."
149242,1,"Softspots are my favorite shoes. These are super comfortable, fit well, and last a long time. So far I have two pairs of these that I use for work, and my feet never hurt. Bravo! I highly recommend them."
327531,1,"I work in a profession that requires me to be on and off my feet for 24 hours straight. And these shoes are unmatched in fit and comfort, and speed for kicking them off, and putting them back on... and so on, and so on... (figured out what I do yet?). I can't say enough great things about these shoes. Try 'em, and I guarantee your feet will never feel better."
281296,1,"Puma's Frankenclyde is the best pair of Puma's I have ever owned! I just spent 4 hrs looking for a pair of Black with Blue strip to replace the ones I have had for two years. I tried to find replacements last year and the pair I got sucks! They are too narrow! I just emailed Puma to ask, WHY SO STUPID! I say that because looking online, I am not the only one who misses these shoes. The only place I could find a decent color was on ebay! Wish me luck and I wish you good hunting! If you can find these, they are worth the money."
275776,1,"At half a century old, I've been camping for as long as I can remember. When I had to start buying my own boots, I went cheap to save money. I got exactly what I paid for! Now don't get me wrong, if you need reliable foot protection to go caving one weekend, K-Mart and WalMart offer excellent choices. Personally, I would rather drop $70 on a great pair of boots and wear them 2 years than spend $30 every 6 months.I've owned 3 pair of Timberlands. The first shrunk too small while drying next to the fire. My bad. The bottom of the 2nd pair, in my opinion, wore out prematurely. It wasn't until the 3rd that I realized the sole was simply an inferior material. Hello Hi-Tec! I fell in love with my first pair immediately.ProsThere was no break-in period, not even for my EEE wide dogs! I wear them till they fall apart. Then I purchase another. Years later, another. The Altitude IV waterproof hiking boot has great ankle support, it's fairly light weight, definitely waterproof, somehow breathes well even for the aroma my feet produce, the speed laces are absolutely a plus and the soles have a more aggressive pattern than comparable brands. (Did I mention I use mine for caving?)ConsConstruction and durability - absolutely NONE!Availability - I only wished more shoe stores carried them so prices would be more competitive. Thank goodness for Amazon.Would I recommend this product?A good pair of boots is an &#34;investment&#34;. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. When I did the math, the only correct answer is Hi-Tec!"
177936,1,"I've been looking for this specific color and style and went to every athletic shoe store in Phoenix and Las Vegas but could not find it until i happened to look on Amazon. They, of course, had it and i ordered it immediately. It took a little longer than expected to get the shoes but once they were here i slipped them on and they fit like a glove."
299157,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
225907,1,Very happy with these sneakers. Look great and feel comfortable. Want to buy another pair!!
284752,0,"The older model of these shoes was fabulous. I am hoping the same type of comfort and performance from this ""next gen"" version."
210796,1,Brought these for my mother and she stated that these were the most comfortable pair of sandals she owns. I would recommend these as good buy as it is very difficult to find wide width shoes
165407,0,"This shoe is okay, but not quite as comfortable as my Medley style or the AP1 style."
67712,0,I really like the color. It is a really pretty shoe. My only problem is that it feels so narrow. I bought a wide shoe. And the shoe tongue is very stuff as other reviewers said. Wish they fit better because i love the color.
387487,1,"I went back and forth on this purchase for a while. I am a huge fan of Frye, and I own/have owned at least six other pairs of Frye boots/shoes. You can't beat Frye for style and quality. I believe they are the oldest continuously operating show manufacturer in America. They provided footwear for soldiers during the Civil War!I wanted a pair of nice, dress boots that I could wear for more formal occasions or even with a suit. I looked at other styles from Frye, like the Oliver and the James. But I am so glad that I went with the Emmett. They are exactly what I wanted. I have worn them with suits and even with my tux, and they look great. They have a great classic style, but at a glance no one would be able to tell you're wearing ""boots."" They blend in to any outfit like a dress shoe would.They aren't super cheap, and they don't seem to come down in price much, especially in black. But I am confident that these will be my black dress shoes for years and years to come. Who knows? With care and with only occasional wear, they may be the last pair of dress shoes you ever buy."
225488,1,"Could not love them any more if I tried! Perfect fit, perfect color, perfect delivery. I especially loved being able to get a half size, which is often hard to do with Converse."
168114,1,"This is my second Danner boot purchase, the first being a pair of Chinese-made imports. While those boots are pretty good, they don't hold a candle to these Hood Winter Lites. Perfect fit, perfect comfort right out of the box. I'm sold!"
130344,1,"I made sure I really knew my correct size before ordering. I have very narrow feet and these shoes fit me perfectly. They are almost like wearing slippers. I take West Coast Swing classes and it's important to be able to spin and turn effortlessly. Regular street shoes do not fit tight enough on my feet and consequently, my feet hurt at the end of the night. These shoes fit like gloves, are very light weight and after several hours of dancing my feet do not hurt! Needless to say, I'm very glad I bought professional dance shoes. I priced shoes locally and the least expensive at the same quality were $40 more."
135051,1,This is my 3rd pair of the Carly sandals which I have bought over the past 5 years (in 2 different colors). They are very comfortable and go with almost any of the outfits which I wear. The service was excellent...very quick and great price. I could not find these shoes in a store.
68764,1,I wasn't really feeling the other colors that came out before the gray and reds. These are so hott and definitely a MUST HAVE. Don't forget to throw on some jeans and a gray &amp; red rocawear shirt and you're good to go. ROC
276088,1,This boot fits to size and is comfortable. I would purchase again. I use to purchase boots from LL Bean.
140242,1,"I have been wearing this shoe style for several years they are very comfortable, light and durable"
386850,1,These shoes fit great and look cool. They were shipped on time and looked exactly as described. My son's friends complimented him on his new shoes!
202791,1,We had to exchange another pair as the 10 didn't fit properly. These were a great option for the new pair.
12016,1,"I ordered these for my granddaughter's birthday. They were shippped promptly, and I was able to track them very efficiently. They were exactly what we wanted!!! They are very attractive and wear well."
292143,2,This shoe shows definite signs of being used. The heel of the shoe is worn and the writing on the inside of the shoe has been rubbed off from use. Terrible!
323013,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
376691,1,"""Comfortable "" doesn't do these shoes justice...like walking on cotton candy puffs all day long! No need to break them in, either. Snug fit so they don't slip or slide off while walking. Sturdy sole makes for surefootedness. Shoes are a bit heavy- fine for me, but some may need to be aware. Waterproof too. Will buy more when needed."
212985,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
382391,1,these are great shoes for anyone to have they are very comfortable and great for playing basketball and even for casual wear
123634,1,the t-mac 3 is a great shoe it looks so niceand is very comftorble. I have 2 pairs the white and the black becauce i like thoughs more then then the blue and red. And just let you guys now the black ones have better traction then the white.DA T-MAC 3s ARE DA BEST!
64376,0,"I buy this shoe for swing dancing. It's a standard shoe in the Lindy Hop community. However, there are some drawbacks to it. It has adequate padding for every day walking, but not dancing, especially when jumps are included. Thus, many of us put insoles into them. However, doing so causes the shoe to fit incorrectly and your heel to slip out when using your regular size, and using the next size up causes the shoe to fit incorrectly in the toe as well.If you dance regularly, this shoe wears out in about a year or two.I put suede on one pair for slickness, but not on a second pair, which I wear on slick floors for more traction. Friends of mine have complained that the current productions of this shoe are slick on the toe and heel and sticky on the ball, giving the shoe an inconsistent slickness and causing unpredictable results on the dance floor.So for every day wear, great! For dancing, ok, but better than other non-dance-specific shoes."
327441,1,"Lets be honest I needed a cheap pair of LARGE wrestling shoes fast to fight in for a army combatives tournament, these were $19.99... How could I go wrong? Well after having got them ONE DAY after I placed the order. And starterd to wear 'em... DAMN!!! I'd of paid the full price for them (whatever it was befor the huge mark down) Well worth it, the company that sent them was EASTBAY."
111950,1,"The shoes are beautiful, no doubt about it.But they are not at all deck shoes (the style they try to copy, shoes people wear on boat decks); they are very slippery when floor is wet or when you go inside after walking in the rain outside. You have to be careful!"
142572,1,"In typical fashion, Crocs' always delivers with true to size and color. Got these for my mother who has been having a problem with swelling feet and now she owns 4 or 5 different colors so they will go with anything. Very comfortable with no slipping or sliding."
50089,1,I originally bought these shoes because I wanted some old school shell tops. After wearing these kicks for a month to the gym and walking around in them I've discovered how comfortable they were and I would definetly buy them again
104713,1,Ordered these shoes to add to my year-round collection of Birkenstocks and Birkenstock-like shoes. These are very nice and the price is considerably lower that Birks.I wear these as often as I want to. Comfortable from the first day.
58238,1,This is the 10th pair of Supernova Cushions I have purchased and I love them. They have a very thick cushion and it has cured my shin splints.
120792,1,I love how comfortable they feel on my feet. I did forget that Timberland's are usually sized a bit large when compared to shoes. Normally I'm a size 12 shoe but only in Timberland's I would be a size 11. Luckily for me I ordered a 11.5 size so it wasn't bad enough for me to return. Just have to lace them up tighter but still not an issue when it comes to them being comfortable and durable. It did take me a couple of days to break them in so now the size issue is none existent.
19288,1,I LIKE THESE SHOES THE STYLE AND WEAR IS VERY COMFORTING. THEY CAN BE DRESS DOWN AND UP IN WHAT EVER YOU WEAR.
33703,1,"I've been wearing the black, classic low converse for several years now and it came that time I needed a replacement pair. Beals Florida shipped it faster than the other items I had ordered from Amazon that same day. Was definitely worth it for the price, and of course the shoes are one of life's little necessities for some of us."
188056,0,"The shoes are comfortable and do the job, look good and have good support. They don't have much coushion but out of all the bike shoes compatible with SPD I would say they are among the best out there. This supplier (Huck N Roll) is however not reliable. I ordered 2pairs to make sure I get the right size. I sent them two requests to return the unopen box and still no response. This is the first time I ever encounter an issue like this on Amazon, I'm still hopeful I'll get some help but I really can't recommend buying anything from Huck N Roll."
22473,1,"I really like these shoes! I just bought them at a local retail store and was looking on here to see if I could find them cheaper. I've always loved Asics running shoes because they are so comfortable on my feet. But the main problem with my old Asics is they're dorky looking for casual wear. These new casual style of Asics fit my feet like my old shoes and actually look great too! They are very lightweight and almost feel like I'm not even wearing shoes. Unlike running shoes, these are very thin and offer very little little support. Lots of shoes make my feet look big, but these make my feet look sleek. Workmanship appears good but I don't think they will last as long as other shoes because they are so thin. Normally I wouldn't pay $70 for casual shoes but I did this time because these are so comfortable and good-looking. If you like Asics running shoes but want something better looking, I highly recommend these shoes!Update 10-2009Well I've had these shoes over 5 years now and they are still in good shape. Granted I don't wear them on a daily basis any more but I was really surprised how well they held up given how thin they are. Hope I can find another pair once these finally do break down..."
136827,1,I would be very greatful if u can let me know if the white chucks is one size bigger then nornal sizing cause I didnt see the remarks like on the black ones.Thanks
269064,1,Have been wearing Rockport shoes for years since wearing a brace. No breaking them in. They are comfortable from day one and good value for the money when purchased from Amazon.
194753,1,I received my Scout Sandal very quickly. It was in perfect shape and fit just like was supposed to.I am very pleased with the service and the product.
278246,1,"I first purchased a pair of Hi-Tech Altitude boots approximately 10 years ago. They fit me extremely well and were very comfortable from the first moment I wore them. Prior to this purchase, I have had 2 different pairs of the Hi-Tech Altitude boots and I have not been disappointed. They wear extremely well and seem to last me about 4 or 5 years. I have found them excellent for everyday wear as well as for use in fishing and hunting. I think these are excellent low cut boots for such a moderate price. Haven't ventured into buying the $100+ boots, but then why should I when these work so well, so can not comment or compare my $70 Hi-Techs to the more pricey boots. I think you will be pleased with these boots."
45328,1,I just can not get away from my tried and true Rockport shoes. I am a Flight Attendant and wore them in the early 70s. I keep coming back to them. These shoes feel great! And well made also.
229955,1,An all year kind of sneaker shoe that can be worn from all. Really comfort for every day use. There is a wide variety of colours which can cover all needs
378167,1,"I bought this for my mom and she loved it... good and complete product, good quality for a very good price"
342778,1,"Normal chucks...awesome as always. I've worn them for the past 2 years. They're looking a little worn now, time to buy another pair. :)"
82961,1,"I have been wearing Reef Ginger sandals for several years now. They are the most comfortable flip-flops I've ever worn. I stand on my feet for 8+ hours a day and when I wear these sandals, my feet don't hurt. I've had several pairs of these flip-flops and I've never had a pair break--I just wear them out from wearing them so much!"
307233,1,"I bought this shoe to use in a 12 hour adventure race consisting of Paddling, Biking and Orienteering. IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM. From the water, to the mud, to the miles on the road on the mountain bike; it took everything I could throw at it. Would recommend to anyone looking for an all around great outdoor shoe."
372386,0,"Pretty well made slipper, however, it runs wide. I always take Medium but it's much too loose. Next time I'll get Narrow as it stretches."
250657,0,"I usually wear 11.5, but it was a bit small for me.The product was good, so i will try 12."
266589,1,This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. These boots have a good arch and seem sturdy. They do look a little cheaper than I anticipated. The tread is great. Size runs true.
350911,1,"Go Merrell (Vibram) it came in a good condition and great quality. Hundred Percent I recommend this one, so light not that Heavy as it looks..."
183553,1,I've had these heels for a few years now and they are still holding strong. I've worn them quite a bit and there's not much wear and tear at all. Definitely worth purchasing.
187295,1,"I just love ugg boots and have a few already. They are warm and comfortable and have given them as gifts also. My shipping experience with the seller was excellent. True to size. Got it when promised. would recommend these boots to everyone. Since the inside is dyed black, the only thing I don't like is that when you take the boots off, have a nice brush handy for scrubbing when taking your bath because the dye comes off on your feet and toes. Still worth it."
312882,0,"I am a Croc addict. There, I said it. BEWARE!!!! Crocs Classic and Crocs Beach have completely different sizing. I wear a W9 in Classic and they all fit like a dream. The same in Beach looks like duck shoes. Huge. These shoes in yellow were not available at this time in the Classic style, so I took a leap. The wrong one. The shoes were returned and my credit was issued immediately. No problem with the shoe or seller, it wasmy fault, but the sizing needs to be standard across all sizes. As far as the transaction with this seller, it gets 5 stars. Crocs themselve get the 3 stars. Will still buy more though!"
378074,1,I purchased this recently and love the way they fit my toddler's feet. They are very comfortable and keep her feet warm in the cold weather. She loves looking at the little faces they have on the them. I'm going to purchase one for a friend expecting in April. I know she will love them!
166653,1,Lovely shoes! Sturdy and so sexxy... I would highly recommend. Of course a shoe of this height is not for the faint of heart
234795,1,I liked the flat enzo shoes. These are very comfortable.I have been wearing these shoes for quite some time.I would recommend these shoes to my family and friends.
137635,1,I ordered these for my mom. She has always wore these even when she was a waitress. Both pairs she wares all the time. Shipping time was excellent!
33221,1,"These shoes are the perfect combination of style, sass, and design. They can be dressed down with a pair of jeans, or dressed up with dress slacks. I bought a pair in red at first, but I loved them so much that I ordered another pair in black!The red ones are extremely comfortable and rub no blisters...even after wearing them all day. The black ones, on the other hand rubbed small blisters the first day I wore them. I have no idea what the difference is between the two pairs.Regardless, these are GREAT shoes and they look GREAT on!"
342916,1,Very satisfied-very long wearing-comfortable shoe-have worn Grasshopper shoes-many styles the last three year-will continue buying them.
29757,0,They didn't have the color I wanted so I settled for a different color shoe.
359590,1,"These shoe are great! They hurt at first, but once they are broken in, they are perfect for anything..."
33797,1,"I got a pair of yellow low-tops for Christmas last year and I LOVE THEM!!! They're about to get holes in them because I wear them so much, and I'm trying to pick out what color I should get. There's so much to love about these shoes. There's like 25 colors to pick from, so there is the oppourtunity to have a piar for EVERY SINGLE OUTFIT. Or, you can wear just one pair, like I do, and mine go with everything. These shoes are breathable, unlike tennis shoes, so your feet don't get all sweaty, which is nice too. These shoes are quite flat inside, but there's nothing that an insert can't fix. THESE SHOES ARE THE BEST!!!"
335691,1,These crocs are incredibly comfortable. I got them for my husband who steps heavily around the house and they have helped loads. The color is very versatile also. He loves them!
111483,1,These shoes are awesome! they look great with everything. you will not be sorry you bought them.
279726,1,These Ariat lace up boots are very comfortable and definitely worth buying. I use them for work every day. They even shed the water well.
136482,1,"great sneakers! look great and fit perfectly. can wear with anything!the best for skydiving :)will definitely buy again, maybe different colors.thank you."
309055,1,"These artsy fartsy Chucks have the All Star logo emblazoned all over the shoe to the point that it's art, not just a logo or signature. You can tuck down the tops for a cool contrast red against blue, I personally prefer the flexible ankle support of a full lace up. Great looking shoe, sure to start conversations!"
133781,1,"If you're new to purchasing dance shoes, make sure you go to the manufacturers website to check their sizing! Buying dance shoes is NOT like buying street shoes.We checked the sizing info, and saw that these dance shoes are comparable to street shoe size, so we opted to getting 1 size up. When the shoes came, my daughter tried them on, and they were just what we were looking for. There was just enough room in the shoe for her to grow into as the dance season progresses. The shoes are very well crafted, as most Capezio brands are, and the fit all around was great."
334933,1,"The product was is in great quality as expected from the Timberland brand. The only issue I had was that the shoe came looking new from the outside whole the inside showed sines of wear (dirt scuffs, sand, etc.) which disappointed me since the shoe was a gift for a loved one. The shoes are comfortable and well supported as reported to me. Be careful when you go with white. Stains only come off if you clean them right away. Scuffs are easily noticeable and near impossible to get off. The colors in the pictures on Amazon are very accurate.I would definitely buy them again and would reccommend it to others."
209256,1,"I was really surprised at how great these shoes fit. They are really comfortable and I love wearing them. At first I thought they wouldn't be wide enough, but they fit great."
363604,1,excellent converse all star. the product was well described and satisfied my needs. the shipment has been quick
23378,1,A freind of mine has these and my husband thought it was cool to always have a bottle opener(even though it is kinda gross if you think about it) So I purchased these shoes as a Fathers Day Gift for my husband. They are VERY Comfy! He loves them!
88152,1,"Very quick shipment. Great product. I ordered the croc in Orange, but one looks sliightly more of a redesh orange."
114708,1,I had this shoe for over 3 years and they still rock! They are comfortable and stylish. Another great buy.
353236,1,"These are awesome boots, they just take forever to break in. These boots will last you forever, though, so a long break in is a small price to pay. The soles last years, and they're replaceable. They're somewhat heavy, so if you're used to lighter, tennis-shoe-style boots these may take some getting used to, but you won't regret it. Make sure you get a good fit and you'll love these boots forever."
233584,1,"Since I wear a hard to find shoe size (9 N), it has been more and more difficult to find a practical shoe in stores in our location (even in N.Y., City). I was delighted to find the The Enzo Angiolini ""Liberty"" shoe through Amazon. It's perfect for casual and dressy casual wear - shopping and running to the dentist or doctor. Ordering was easy and service was prompt. I'll do it again in the future."
334356,0,"The shoes arrived in a timely fashion and were even cuter in person than they appeared online. However, they were AT LEAST 1/2 size too small. I am a 5 1/2 and sometimes can even wear a 5. These were miniature! I took them to a shoe stretcher and they had to use the smallest stretching tool they owned to work with them. When I came to pick them up, the staff there was like, ""oh, those tiny shoes!""I also happened to buy a Jessica Simpson dress online the same week and it was also smaller than the same size would have been anywhere else, so maybe this is a pattern with her whole line."
305489,1,"I have worn this style of shoe for years. It is a comfortable shoe. Of course, I would suggest that you try the shoe in a store first before purchasing on the internet because you can't judge the fit by a picture on a website. Since I had originally purchased the shoe in a store, I now purchased it on Amazon, and the quality and fit seem to be consistent."
286361,1,"As a soccer lover I know first-hand that Adidas does very well in this area when making products. However I was displeased with this shoe. The picture can be quite deceiving, it looks a longer when worn. This gives the shoe a boat like appearance that I found to be unattractive. I suggest watching a review on youtube just so you can get a more accurate presentation of these shoes. Secondly whenever it rains outside (with thunder) my team takes up a nice game of Futsal indoors in the gym. Let me just say that these shoes had 0 traction. I was literally slipping and gliding, and for all who've played Futsal you know it's a game where ball control is crucial.I'll give these four stars because they're meant to be casual sneakers, some people may like the look, and because they are a charming classic."
347807,1,product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
232571,1,"I got these Adidas Supernova Control Running shoes to replace some cardio/cross training shoes that I had worn out (also Adidas). First of all, I have to say that Adidas has some of the best cross training/running shoes on the market! Keep in mind, buying shoes that have a regular retail price of $50-$70 are not going to get you quality. You'll need to buy the shoes that retail at $100-$130 (or more) to get the arch support and custom fitting to ensure that you have a pain-free workout every time (of course, until you wear them out from usage).My recommendation, go to a custom foot store, try on shoes and determine what type and style of Adidas shoes you need for your feet, then come on-line to Amazon and buy them at a discounted price. I tried these shoes on at the store, made sure they were what I needed and wanted, then I came to Amazon and saved 50% off the retail price in the store and my shipping was FREE! Keep in mind, I find that I have to buy Adidas running/cross training shoes 1 full size bigger than my regular size - that is another reason to try on the shoes to determine size, but not buy at the retail stores.These shoes are great for my cardiokickboxing and any other cardio workouts that I do. I have another pair of Adidas shoes strictly for running as they are the top of the line that Adidas offers and well worth the price! Spend the extra money on Amazon and buy the Adidas Adistar Control Shoes for your running - these are the best and most comfortable shoes for running and well worth every penny. Again, buy a size up from your normal shoe size but you won't regret it. Finally, I'm very narrow heeled and medium width in the front of my shoe and I'm able to tighten the laces with the 2nd holes that Adidas offers on all of their shoes - it is great to help fit everyone from the wide to the medium to the narrow width people. Buy these shoes or the Adistar Control shoes now and you won't regret it!"
225321,1,I couldn't purchase these anyplace in town and as usual you had them available for me! I got them in record time and ready to send off for a christmas gift.
250715,1,"I had them since I was in HS and they were one of the most comfy shoes I have had since. I am now about 3 years into college and they continue to be my favorite pair... And of course, Globe knows their stuff!Enjoy!:)"
256427,1,"I love these shoes. They are comfortable and durable. My feet do sweat a little in them, but it is summer time. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because the left shoe the strap will not stay forwards. As I walk in them it slowly comes back and rides funny on my ankle. I have not contacted the company about this."
74010,1,This is second pair that I bought for my daughter and she absolutely loves them. Quality is great. They are soft and cant beat amazon price. I would definitely order more.
25441,1,"After hearing a few 'word of mouth' reviews from friends, I decided to look into Danner to see if I would pay this much for a pair of boots. Suffice it to say, I am glad that I did. Taking the boots out of the box I immediately noticed the fine workmanship and attention to detail. The leather used in the upper feels like what good leather should feel like. I am still getting used to the fact that the tongue comes over the side instead of up the middle. I don't know if other shoes/boots do this, but I certainly find it unique and adds to the overall comfort. Adding to that comfort are the &#34;airthotic&#34; inserts that Danner includes. At first I chose to leave them out, but after deciding to leave them in for a day, I found that they're comfortable enough to leave in. I've been wearing them around regularly but haven't done any serious hiking yet. I'll update after that. Until then, buy these boots. They feel good, every one of their components are of the utmost quality, and the stitch-down construction is pretty freaking cool."
267298,1,"These boots are the best I've ever owned. So good, that I own two pairs, and bought my dad a pair. And he swears by them too. If you have aching feet, soreness, or a weak ankle, these boots have a therapeutic effect! I am not into medicine or anything but I have to say, these boots are very supportive and make your feet feel strong and no strain on the joints."
252652,1,"I love these shoes. I am 44 and have spent the last 10 years dealing with back issues. I have had three back surgeries and have lingering foot, back, and mobility issues. These shoes are stable, supply great arch support, and have a deep heel register to really hold onto my foot. If I needed to there, is plenty of room to put my thick custom orthotics, but I don't need to. They have excellent support just as they are. They have a fun Mary Jane look that is so much better than most orthopaedic shoes. I wear them with pants and capris. They are a bit chunky for wearing with a skirt, but when my back is having a bad day, I have done it. I have these in black, grey, and brown."
91811,1,This is a very comfortable shoe.It also looks very nice. I like the Black and Brown style.Good for casual and church.
202178,1,"I really like the boots but unfortunately I had to return them because I need a larger size. I shipped them out today and can,t wait to get the new ones."
234443,1,It's a reliable and good product. I always wear this make of shoe. it was shipped well.thanks. and good price.
93083,1,Love the looks and confort of this shoe. Fit true to size and required no breaking in period. Goes with so many of my summer clothes.
129502,1,These are super sexy without being too high. They run a half size big so account for that. They are a soft leather and they wear great!
247286,1,My husband wears these around the house most of the day. He says they are warm and comfortable. He loves them.
17191,1,"These sandals are the perfect replacement for my Ocean Pacific sandals I bought back in 2000.As a frugal libertarian slacker dude, I wear my clothes until they fall apart. So when I buy my clothing, I prefer to spend the money on quality clothing once up front, and wear them for many years, as apposed to buying cheap clothing and having to replace them more often than necessary.These ECCO Men's Yucaton Sandals are very comfortable and seem very durable at this stand point (one month of summer slacking) and I am confident they will last as long as my 12 year old O.P.'s."
272589,0,"I have read several review complaining about how narrow these shoes are, well send them to me because that hasn't been my experience.I have narrow feet and I bought my first 2 pair about 3 years about ago and they fit perfectly. They are comfortable and provide adiquate arch support and cushing. Wanting some different colors I ordered some more the following year and am looking still looking for a pair that fit as well as the first. Teva has lengthed the strap that goes over the arch making them too big for me, I can hardly keep the shoe on making them uncomfortable to walk any distance. Teva, can you shorten the top strap about 1/4""? While that would still be loose on me, it would make them easier to keep on."
348902,1,"I purchased these boots for my son Jake for Christmas. They came really fast and were exactly what I ordered so I was very happy. Also, the price was $20 less than anywhere else I had looked, and there were a lot of places. Thanks!"
202786,1,"My husband didn't know he needed these but they were comfortable from the first and he loves them. Very well made, attractive and versatile.Haven't used the water-proof part yet but glad to have it."
50948,0,"The Park Avenue looks good, and so far, it fits my feet well.The quality seems to be very good, other than one thing, there is one metal eyelet missing. I'd think AE quality control would have caught this. Since I like the shoes, I'm going to keep it, but still disappointed that it obviously have an issue which shouldn't be there to begin with."
30723,1,"I really like this shoe! It's hard for me to find a shoe as narrow as I need, but this one fits just right across the toes and on the heel. It's a little wide at the instep, but I can definitely live with it. I was a little dissappointed to find there is no arch support. I think if there were a support, the wideness would disappear."
369863,1,"I find this pair of Reebok running shoes to be of excellent quality. They are very comfortable and cushion the shock of walking. I am past the running age, so I need a good foundation and arch support. The price was right also. Reebok is the best name in sport shoes in my estimation. Thank you. I hope this helps."
163509,1,"I've been wearing these for years. They are the most comfortable, long lasting sneakers I have ever owned. I like the slim line to these. I don't care much for the big bulky looking ones."
41428,0,"I bought this shoe bacause I have a wide foot and this was one of the few shoes I could get online at 12EEE. The sneaker is very comfortable for walking. It is terrible for running though, my feet would really hurt after running in these shoes. If you are going to do any running DON'T BUY THIS SHOE! Otherwise, I think its a very good sneaker."
259682,0,"Bought this for my cousin, he said it an big about half to a whole size. He's an 8.5 and i bought him the 8.5 and its big on him but he was fine with it since he wears thick socks anyway. The color black was really nice and the design as well. As for the quality, can't speak for it right now since we just got it but so far upon close inspection when i got the shoes, it look durable and made well so hopefully it'll last long."
196833,0,"I bought these to replace another pair of Ariat pull on boots I have been wearing for the past couple of years for work. They look great and after breaking them in they feel great.Unlike my other pair, these have no traction. I wore them in the snow the first week and could not walk up a snow covered hill. At work I have to be very careful walking in mechanical rooms that have any water on the floor. I also need to be careful walking into a building with a smooth floor if it was raining outside."
155250,1,"I got these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them! They look really nice. We've only had them for a few weeks, so I don't know about their durability, but they look good! They came with two sets of laces--one white set and one royal blue set (they look kind of retro). My husband liked that because he can have two totally different looks. Great price, great looking shoes!"
107188,1,"im glad with this product, i know them from before and was a good price."
261867,1,love these shoes. my second pair but these are alot tighter than the one i have had for 3 years.
209844,1,"These boots were comfortable right out of the box and exceeded my expectations. I have owned Justin, Tony Llama and Nikona boots and these Ariats are better than any of them."
16783,1,I've purchased several pairs of the cleats over the years. They're very comfortable for how light they are. I like that they don't flex too much on the bottom.
322301,0,"I have been wearing this model for over twenty years. When they switched from Vibram soles a few years ago the quality declined significantly. Previously I got two years of daily use out of the shoes, now I get less than a year, with holes wearing through the inner sole in the heel and the mid-foot. I still find them very comfortable and the waterproof feature makes them great in the rain, but I yearn for the better quality of the previous model. Over the years I found that the Rockport quality has deteriorated. A few years ago I purchased a pair of wingtips with the Rockport alternate budget brand they were terrible. I believe they ultimately pulled that product line from the market, but the quality is not the same."
18172,0,"These shoes look fantastic, but they seem to be a different shape to my feet - they're too long and too narrow, giving me blisters on my pinkie toes."
18790,0,"I ordered two pairs of shoes for a musical: one black pair and one white pair. The black pair wore wonderfully, but the white pair broke a strap and when cleaned the coating peeled off the shoe."
381095,1,Easy Spirit tennis shoes are the best for my feet that I have found. They have good cushioning and arch support. These are relatively inexpensive as far as Easy Spirit's go. I am very happy with my new shoes so far. They have met the Easy Spirit threshold as I expected.
134941,1,"these are great with the stretchy straps. because crocs have 2 sizes (8/9, 10/11, etc), if you're on the smaller side of the 2 sizes, the stretchy straps help to keep the crocs on the little feet better than the standard crocs. works fabulously for my son. in fact, he won't wear anything else!"
182437,1,My wife teaches nursing clinicals and needed a great shoe to help her keep up her pace every session. These shoes do the job and then some.
164629,1,"This is my first pair of UGG boots. I am 7 1/2 and they fit PERFECT!! highly recommended. Ordered them and arrived in less than 4 days! Why pay for a Women size if you can fit in a kids size 6, and save some $$$?This seller is at UGG.com sellers list. Trustable."
76903,0,"I order those cheap shoes for dancers a show in Montreal .Shoes are rather sharp ( old model 1995 ). The final cost (transport and customs,) double the price(prize). It is not a real sale.. And this old style finally cost me around 90.00 !! ( Independently of the shape, those shoes are comfortable."
273856,1,Shoes are really pretty and comfortable. I have received many compliments. They are easy to clean and have a little elastic on the back that makes them easy to put on and take off. I have trouble wearing heels but I was able to handle these well.
75894,1,"I have worn these shoes for a while now and they are the most comfotable sandal I have ever owned. I am about to buy another pair. Oh, did I mention I have foot probems? Not with these sandals."
253071,1,"I had heard all the good reviews for this boot, so I decided to take the plunge. I normally wear a 12/13 depending on the brand, so I tried on a 12 in the store. It still seemed a little big so I ended up ordering the 11.5 from Amazon and it's perfect, if not a little big. I can wear this boot anywhere and with anything. I bought some Sno Seal and am hoping it wont turn the Beeswax color too dark, but once its sealed I will wear this boot all winter long."
227800,1,I bought these for my mother who has had lifelong shopping issues in regards to her feet. She said she loves these shoes and they fit wonderfully.
79377,1,This shoe was true to size and a perfect shoe! The color is the best red! Can't go wrong with a Chuck Taylor!
188441,1,Purchased this product for myself. Keeps my feet nice and warm. I would recommed washing in cold water and line drying to prevent shrinking.
164161,0,"Purchased a pair of these last year. Great hiker, light weight, good grip sole. Used almost daily for light trails. The only complaint is the material that covers the rear shank,(behind your heal/achilles, has worn through exposing the plastic shank which left the shoes unwearable. This could be solved if bit more padding or double over the material could solve this issue. Would I purchase again, yes."
328817,1,"Beautiful, awesome boots if you get them from a none junk shop! Watch out where you buy from!I'm 12 B, ordered 12D - seller said they run large. Nope, returned for damaged 13D and still tight but would have streched. Won't buy from them again on that.Sweet boots though! Just watch who you buy from!"
118226,1,These shoes seem to be really high quality but my daughter wears a 6 I ordered a 7 to be safe and they came EXTREMELY small. I know her foot didn't grow because all of her other size 6 shoes still fit well. I had to re-order a larger size so her little toes aren't crunched.
1791,1,"I tried on several more expensive backpacking boots before settling on this one. I have high arches and this boot fit and felt the best. I've put 70-80 miles of backpacking on the boot, including some hard, heavy miles. So far the boot is holding up fine. And they feel great - like I'm walking on cushions.The only downside so far is the leather has worn more quickly than I expected and the waterproofing seems to be wearing off - even after an additional waterproofing treatment.Update:My left boot stopped being supportive after about 90 miles of mid-weight backpacking (with 30-40 lbs). These boots are probably just not durable enough to rely on for backpacking."
94570,0,"I have owned Propet Walkers before and was willing to go the extra money to purchase another pair. They are good at support. My one disappointment was that they were listed as ""wides"" and they don't seem very wide at all. The tongue is thick and adds to the difficulty of getting the straps all they way across."
265987,1,"I'm really, really happy with these boots. An awesome price for a super-sturdy piece of footwear that seems like it's going to last a really long time. I needed footwear that would support my ankles, for both every day walking and hitting the hills with my dogs. These fit the bill.Why buy a second pair?Two reasons:1) I'm paranoid the price will go up.2) These are nice enough to wear out into the real world, and I didn't want to have to worry about keeping my daily pair ""nice"".The biggest problem for me? They do require some breaking in and for me, it was kind of a painful process. They are rigid, strong boots, and they do give way eventually. Already, after only a few months, my first pair are taking on that nice patina that well-worn leather boots get.It makes me said that I'll have to go through that process again with my second pair, which will take longer because they will be worn less frequently."
140407,1,This is my third pair of these flip flops. They are the best flip flops ever. Comfy. Cute. Perfect. And the new ones with the cute stitching are awesome.
11029,1,just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo. I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box. They feel like I already broke them in. These are going to be great for pants or skirts. I'm very happy with them.
241821,1,"I love the new reebok shoes but they should make them for women also. Because they are wonderful they feel good when you were them. The reason I gave the shoes 4 stars is because they don't make them for women becuse most women play sports like: basketball, and other sports. I think that they are wonderful as a matter of fact you should buy some and I mean right now! Go, run and get these before there is none let. Serious cause knowing me and all of my friends and family are going to be wearing them. I love reebok shoes!!!! Buy them NOW I mean it!!!"
377808,0,"I love saucony running shoes, however, these shoes are considerably different and do not measure up as well as the saucony running shoes. Never the less, for just a basic shoe for messing around (home, park, light work, etc.) they are of good quality. I would not recommend them as a running shoe (I do not recommended them for trail running or road running or any other significant running)."
83408,1,"I really like these flip flops, but when I walk in them they make a lot of noise. The flip flop noise if you know what I mean! They are the loudest flip flops I have ever owned. When I walk I try to hold them closer to my foot (so they won't be so loud), but it does not seem to work. Other than that, it did take alittle while to get use to the arch support. I have only ever had flat flip flops. I'm not sure if they are the best for walking long distances which is what I wanted. But basically they are comfortable and look nice."
265145,1,Great boots. Never had better. Hold up well and definitely keep the water out. Nice and warm in the New England winters. Highly recommend these boots.
81457,1,That's a product with a long tradition in market and I just was replacing my old sneakers. Coverse really rules.
96643,1,The products are made smaller than the spec. I bought size 9 even though I wear 8-1/2 shoes yet I have force them to put them on. They will keep your feet worm like they say. I suggest the other to buy at least a size larger.
345453,1,Great purchase! Great service! Great delivery! my boyfriend was very happy with his present. Thank you for making it so easy
356195,1,"I just got these shoes- the soles are uncomfortable, but they were on $13 and they look pretty nice- a good deal on a shoe you will just wear every once in a while for the looks."
51682,1,"This is my 2nd pair of Propet walkers. I have the other pair that has mesh instead of solid leather, which are good for summer time but not winter when it's wet outside. I wanted a leather pair to keep the moisture out of my shoes when I'm outside & I do walk a lot so a good walking shoe is a must.I'm type 2 diabetic & was having some ingrown toe nail problems. After buying my 1st pair of these shoes, within 3 months I was able to get rid of the ingrown toe nail. The shoes have more toe room & are stable to keep my foot from rolling out when I walk. I was having lots of back pain, and if I don't get a good shoe like i said my foot rolls out & my ankles start to hurt.With these shoes I have no pain, am steady on my feet & the rubber sole is good to keep me from sliding around on wet floors: an added plus.I wanted to mention that these shoes are comfortable, they have a snug fit feel to them, but not so tight that your feet feel crammed. Earlier I was wearing these shoes because my feet were so swollen I couldn't get anything else on except slippers. These went right on, did not make my feet feel crammed, & with the heel pain I was having from the swelling i couldn't feel it.These are really some nice shoes, they are light weight & feel good after being on my feet all day walking around, even when I take the dog for a walk.I've cleaned out my closet of all the other favorite shoes I had, and only have these 2 pairs now. Nothing else can compare to how these feel for me & how well they keep my feet healthy."
310941,1,These boots are great. My husband swears it's like not wearing shoes at all. They are tough and withstand his job as a groundsman for a tree company. Outstanding. You can't go wrong with Tims.
312172,1,"I am now definitely a Clarks fan-most of the shoes that I own are by Clarks.The Sarong is a very cute shoe that looks nice with dresses,skirts,jeans,or shorts. The heel height is very nice and the shoe is extremely comfortable.I needed no break in period,they were comfortable from the very first wearing.There is no consistency in sizing though.I ordered 9.5 wide in the teal,and it's so wide my feet tend to slide through.I ordered the same size in the pink and it cut into my foot.I also ordered a pair in the same size the mint green and these are just fine."
113743,1,"The shipping was prompt, the shoes are GREAT and I have another order ready to send! Thanks for your commitment to customer satisfaction!!"
42007,1,I got my Kayanos because they were so cheap ($35). Best decision I ever made. Amazing support (I slightly overpronate and have weak ankles) and durability for middle distance running. These have inspired me to run more and stick with Asics.
381395,1,"I stand on my feet all day always looking for comfy shoes especially if they are cute,heel height perfect,could dance hrs in these,but will be wearing them to church and when I want to dress up,heel fits snug in a good way,love em,proab get another color since cute comfy shoes hard to find,yay."
334043,1,"Great steel toe boot that don't hurt your toes and is waterproof too. I've been wearing this style boot for over six years. Steel toes are required at my work. These have the oblique (wide) toe which keeps the steel toe from rubbing your toes as most boots do. Instead of buying boots half a size bigger to allow for the steel toe, on these you can buy boots that fit your feet and still have room at the toe. They are light weight, soft soles, cushioned in-soles and are water proof on top of all it's other qualities. For a per that works in a manufacturing industry, on their feet most all of the day and all concrete on top of that, these boots are great. I'll continue buying these boots as long as Rocky continues to make them and definately would recommend them to anyone that is looking for a good comfortable water proof boot. And for those that don't need the steel toe, they also make these same boots without the steel toe."
231361,1,THE SHOES WERE DELIVERED SO MUCH EARLIER THAN THE EXPECTED DATE. GREAT JOB! MY SON LOVES IT SO MUCH FOR THE COMFORTNESS AND SHOWING OFF HIS BOOTS TO EVERYONE HE KNOWS. NO REGRETS AT ALL AND WORTH BUYING!
184479,1,"The shoe was one half size too short even though others said the shoe was fairly true to fit. No big deal, however. I packaged them in the box and used the Eastbay ""Smart Return"" label that came with the box. If you have any problem with the shoes, send them back and Eastbay will handle the transaction for you for a mere $6.50 return fee. They do NOT tell you that the return may take up to THREE weeks to process without any idea of a return date. The original shipment was fine. The return was awful so far. I returned them on 4-6 and on 4-8 they left Greensboro, NC. That's all I can tell you. That's all Eastbay can say other than ""I just answer the phone and I have been told to tell customers who use the Smart Label (or whatever it is called) that it may take 3 weeks to get here."" There may be instances of slow service by USPS, but I have NEVER encounted that type of delay. Eastbay essentially says tough and that's it. This is a quick review of an unsettled issue. When the process is over, if at all, I'll let you know more. JudyToday is the 19th and Eastbay does not know anything about the shoes. The Postal Service (contradiction of terms?) knows nothing even though they have a tracking number provided by Eastbay. Amazon, on the otherhand, has come to the rescue or at least they have tried to help unlike Eastbay and our wonderful USPS. My resolve: no more purchases from Eastbay; no more dealing with USPS."
338269,1,"This is the second Converse Low Top I bought this week because of sizing error(my fault). I ordered a size 10 in Mens the first time because I'm a legit size 10.5 Mens in every other shoe I wear. The shoes were received quickly by mail and the quality is great. When I tried them on, I had a good amount of space inside the shoes to move my toes which was too much for me. These size 9.5 shoes are a perfect fit. The sellers advice is spot on about sizing. Order 1 size down from your usual shoe size if you want a good fit. Other than that, these shoes are great for casual walking and weight training. I use them for dead lifting and squatting. Definitely recommend these shoes to anyone!"
16716,1,"Awesome cleats. Comfortable and Amazing. Price is good, I almost cheeped out to save $30 to buy another pair and I'm so glad I didn't. I'd recommend these cleats and plan to be a lifetime customer of the Copa's."
69772,1,"Love the shoe, Love the look, but only thing I have an issue with is it's width. The shoe is very narrow....otherwise a wonderful shoe...love it"
154912,1,"Thios show is great! Comfortable for my daughter to wear, and excellent capezio manufacturing. However, my daughter wears a 6.5, size 7 she has some room. I ordered a 7.5 wide, I danced for years and know ballet slippers are narrow. The 7.5 barely fits! I would return them but even the 10 minutes she wore them around the room showed too much wear to return. She will be able to wear them a few wooks before having to order new ones."
89857,1,"The most comfortable and durable walking shoes I've found, especially great for travelling as they don't mark you immediately as a tourist (unlike sneakers), slip on and off easily when going through security, and look good in all but dressy situations. I only ever need to buy a new pair every year or two because I wear out the support in them for lengthy walking. I still have my original two pair for use around the house or on weekend errands. While not waterproof, the shoes seem to be water resistant, the sole thick enough to keep the cold of the pavement from coming through, and a decent enough grip to walk in all but the iciest conditions. I hope Eastland never stops making these shoes!"
161976,1,I like this product because it was not used.Good product and cheaper than the official site.that is it
247196,1,This is my second pair of the same shoe and I love it. So comfortable and good wear and tear.
244790,1,These shoes are most comfortable. I first purchased an 8N; they were too small. I returned and requested an 8 1/2N. Promptly received the replacement. I can wear with slacks and skirts.
320335,1,"Received these shoes yesterday. I got a white pair in 7.5 - my street shoe size. Just for comparison, all of my Adidas sneakers are women's 7.5. I was really worried, because some reviews indicated that the shoes run small. They fit PERFECTLY.I got these for my Halloween costume, but now I plan to wear them around the house too."
236959,0,"SOFTSPOTS SHOES ARE VERY COMFORT, BUT THIS PAIR I HAD TO RETURN, BECAUSE THE SHOES WERE TOO LONGAND TOO WIDE."
177800,1,"These boots are very comfortable right out of the box. Good fit. No stiffness or ""breaking in"" time. I did spray them with waterproofing."
64109,1,"I love this shoe. It is the same style that I had twenty years ago. The shoe is light weight, comfortable, and durable. I would highly recommend them because you would not want to wear any other tennis shoe.Sincerely,csh"
171259,1,"These are comfortable from day 1. Slip-ons are a nice convenience because they also slip off. You can kick them on and off at work. (I keep heels under my desk and slip these off and the heels on whenever I get up to go to a meeting or walk somewhere.)They fit securely on your feet when you slide your foot in them. You can wear them all day long. They wear well and they look nice. The many color and fabric configurations available give you some nifty choices for attention getters to plain and simple. I need a comfortable shoe and this is it. I am not someone who can walk into a Payless store and find something.If you have access to an Easy Spirit outlet, you can often find this style there at a good price."
326971,1,"I discovered Reef Ginger flip flops years ago, and will not buy any other flip flop since. The arch support in these plus fabric uppers, makes them comfortable for all day walking in summer, and no irritation between toes. They do squish over time and lose their support, but they usually last a full summer season for me.These are really the best!"
375755,1,These shoes are replacements for dome I have had for a long time...not worn them yet nut expect same quality as before.
6049,1,This is the third pair of Easy Spirit Motion shoes I've bought. They are so comfortable and support my feet. I wear them to work and they look great with slacks. These shoes are very sturdy and well made as well as comfortable. I heard that Easy Spirit is discontinuing this style. I hope it isn't so!
144168,1,Love them. Very cold here today in DC. They keep my feet very warm. Great for winter weather anywhere. Like!!
242318,1,"An old school shoe, with style. How did our feet survive these things? Oh, that's right, they didn't."
277616,1,"I compared hiking boots for quite awhile trying to choose the best for my situation. My ankles had been bothering me if I pushed too hard for years. Last fall, I injured some ligaments and tendons in my right heel and it was painful to walk. I reviewed and read reviews of hiking boots up to about $600, comparing features, weight, etcetera. I was unwilling to spend that much not being sure they would work for me. Many hiking boots are not available as a wide width, which I need. I read a review of hiking boots under $200, focused on the Hi-Tec Altitude boot; liked the price, features, and weight, and bought a pair. When they arrived, I put them on and was impressed how comfortable they were right out of the box. I wore them around home to break them in for several days, then went for a three mile walk - my feet felt great. Because everything I really like is sometimes not available when I need to replace them, I ordered a second pair and put them on the shelf for future use. I have had them several months now and am reveling in my new freedom."
181069,1,"This item is exactly as described. The leather is high quality, and it is well very well sewn. I recommend this for any looking for this size and shape of wallet."
562,0,The boot was well priced and solidly built but not true to size.I would go at least a half size smaller.
216959,1,I am not pleased with the fact that I returned the item & requested an exchange of a smaller size. Instead I was given a refund even after I filled out the exchange request. This was a gift for my daughter & she was disappointed that they refused to make the exchange.
119780,1,"I bought the shoes for my little sister as a gift. She was delighted. She says the shoes are very confortable and can wear different styles. Nice confection and they were sent ontime. From my side, no complains."
365937,1,"An old school shoe, with style. How did our feet survive these things? Oh, that's right, they didn't."
117778,1,"First of all these shoes look awesome. I got them for about 22 dollars and they were perfect. Shipped on time and packaging was excellent. Also they are light and thin but they are meant to be so for running purposes. Also they are very very strong on the bottom as in their sole so they will hold up for awhile. Also I use them for running only every now and then and they look great enough to where you can wear them as sneakers. This is because the spikes on the bottom are removable, comes with a handy tool for it."
321028,1,"lots of comments about size ...so much so that i anticipated having to send them back.here's my advice - don't use the size charts listed because its way off. Do this:get a tape measure - stand on it, measure from the bottom rear of your foot up to the tip of your big toe...then match that with the size next to it... (skip all the US/ EU / GB size... they are clearly wrong on the size listing)So, my daughters measurement was 10"" from back to tip - we ordered size 9. Perfect fit.okay, material quality is nice for wearing around the house or art school... but from what i could tell, it won't stand up to constant use. But hey, they're inexpensive (relatively speaking) so buy a few pair.m"
148797,1,These are my new &#34;go-to&#34; shoes. I'll be wearing them for years to come. These moccasins are also beautifully made.
181991,1,"These are the only boots that I will wear to work because they are so comfortable and durable. I even have them resoled after I wear them down to make them last longer, but when I do have to buy more, I will always buy another pair of these. I would highly recommend these boots!!"
326534,1,Bought these for my daughter who has flat feet and won't wear her sneakers with arch supports. Last summer I bought her very expensive flip flops that she wouldn't wear because they were too heavy. She loves these. Even bought a second pair. The bottom if firm enough that she she doesn't feel every pebble and I am happy because they have an arch support.
86977,2,"Nothing wrong with these boots, but they are not the kind of thing to buy off the web. Go some place and try them on first. I ordered a 9.5M and they were about 3/4 inch longer than other shoes I have of the same size."
56288,1,"I love Keds tennis shoes. Denim is very hard to find and I'm thankful Amazon is so easy to shop. No muss, no fuss. Just find the product and someone brings it to your door. I must say, though, that there should never be s&h charges on anything. Bank rates and credit card rates are getting too difficult to live with without having to considering s&h."
247500,2,"Shoe is advertized as a leather upper. When it comes it is clearly marked as ""ALL MAN-MADE MATERIALS"" inside the heel. Also shoe has to be sent back to seller who charges anywhere from a 15% restocking fee for a ""damaged shoebox"" to 50% for ""trying-on wear."" Seller is a rip-off. Do not buy! I wish I had a ZERO STAR rating to use."
157237,1,These shoes are great it's very comfortable shoes and very nice look. I love them.
341446,1,"I had difficulty finding these sneakers in the usual local stores, so I was pleased that I was able to order them online. I think they fit better than the ones I usually get in the stores. The shipment was received very promptly and I was pleased with the entire transaction."
314221,0,Well after spending $85.00 on a pair of boots that were supposed to be a wide width I then had to take them to a shoe shop twice to have them stretched before I could even wear them.I will deffinately buy these kind of boots from in store before ordering online again. They were just so narrow they were almost going to go back but I decided to spend the extra dollars to have them stretched and thank god it worked or I would have been out alot of money. I suggest if you want to buy Timberlands go to a store and try them on first!!!
119698,1,Basically just got what I ordered. Thanks for the deal! The size and shoe were both correct and they were brand new.
206694,1,"The only reason I don't give the 5 stars to this shoe is because the rubber tip sort of hurts your big toe. No matter how I laced them, tight or loosen, it was hurtful, up to point I had to stop using them."
343224,1,Product line is favorable...prices fair...I ahd a pair just like this 3 years it lasted...then the inside collapsed at the heal...into the trash they went...was happy to find them again...
316236,1,These are super comfy and totes adorb! In reading the reviews before making my purchase I noticed most people said to size down by 1 size but I'm glad I only chose to buy 1/2 size down. I have already bought a pair of slippers and a ran pair of loafers cause these are the most comfortable and cute shoes!! Highly suggest!
388142,1,I love these shoes. They are extremely comfortable and conform to your foot with minimal break in time. I used to play in Puma Kings and am glad to see that the quality has continued and been carried into their indoor products.Glad to see an indoor shoe that is still made from leather!
88053,0,"I realize dance slippers run small, so I ordered my niece an ENTIRE size up from her normal. Still way too small. I would seriously recommend you order a size, maybe even two sizes up from what your little one normally wears.."
387857,1,"I have this Crocs Beach Clog finally after trying another style in my size. I also have the Wrapped Clog (very nice) BUT in womens sizes- the size labeled 8 is really just over a size 9...........and in unisex sizing- to get an 8, i ordered a women's 6-7.......otherwise i love crocs~"
368709,1,"I bought these for my brother for Christmas. He wears 8.5 W (US) so I bought the 42M (EU) and they fit perfectly. It is a little difficult ordering shoes in European sizes without trying them on, but the sizing scale was accurate. He loves them! They shipped fast and in an official Birkenstock shoe box."
72659,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
38863,1,"Bought these for my son as a gift. Seem like a very nice shoe, will know more once he opens them for Christmas. My daughter in law suggested them and I couldnt find them in the shoe store so as usual I found them on AMAZON! I hope he love the way they feel on his feet . The delivery was as usual awesome cant wait til he sees them&#62;"
369966,1,"I find this pair of Reebok running shoes to be of excellent quality. They are very comfortable and cushion the shock of walking. I am past the running age, so I need a good foundation and arch support. The price was right also. Reebok is the best name in sport shoes in my estimation. Thank you. I hope this helps."
238703,1,"These are fantastic! Hardwood and metal, sturdy construction from what I can tell so far. I've only used them twice now, but after having my son, my left foot didn't seem to fit into my old shoes quite as easily as it did before my pregnancy. I know that the arches can be broken down during this time, and I'm afraid that's what happened... but with this shoe stretcher, it only took 1 hour to create just a little ""toe box"" room, and my shoes are more comfortable than they were originally... so comfortable, I could actually wear them all day! Very pleased with my purchase so far!"
364892,1,I like this product because it was not used.Good product and cheaper than the official site.that is it
241505,1,I got them today around the time they said they would be here. The shoes were in great condition inside the box and they were just what I expected to be. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I would order from them again.
370128,1,My daughter has very narrow feet and this style fits her well. She wears a size 6 street shoe and a size 5.5 in this style. Our studio requires the shoes to be very tightly fitted so these work well for us.
103695,1,"I am glad I purchased these boots. Not only I feel safer riding my motorcycle, I also don't feel out of place in the board meetings. Couldn't ask for a better deal and value for money."
219757,1,"Needed for a wedding and they worked. They are a little tight but I'm stretching them out, width wise but other than I like them a lot!"
28401,0,Price was amazing but shoes were not true to Dr Martens comfort and size. The shoes were uncomfortable and a larger size than any of the other Dr Martens that I own. I guess some deals are too good to be true.
350896,1,"I am tough on hiking shoes. I hike in the desert mountains around Phoenix almost daily, especially this time of year. The Merrell brand of hiking shoes and boots have always held up. These Moab ventilators seem to be very well built. The are a little bit short....but not enough to go up to a half size larger. I am hoping they will break in easy and maybe even relax a bit in the length. I look forward to updating this review when I get a few miles on them."
34738,1,I bought these shoes because I heard from other nurses how great they were and I needed a leather shoe for safety sake. I am so pleased with them that I now have been recommending them to everyone.
108655,1,"I bought these directly from Carrie B's (I live in Portland). They are fantastic practice dance shoes. The tops are soft, glove-like leather and you can wear them for hours at a time (they feel more like you're dancing in socks than shoes).They're particularly slick on hardwood floors, but I even swing with them on carpet."
154630,1,"I have been wearing Justin boots for over 8 years now and they are by far the best boots I have ever owned. Every few years I get the idea that this other brand of boots that cost a little less will work just as good but after a couple weeks of wearing them I am back in my Justins again. I would recomend these boots for anyone that wants a boot that looks good, last a long time, and will be comfortable dad after dad."
371118,1,"I agree with the previous reviewer, the boots were a little longer and a little more narrow than expected. I wear a 7 double-wide when available, and a 7.5 wide most of the time. I ordered a 7.5 wide and was not sure at first whether I should return them for a 7 wide - I did not want to exchange them only to find out they were a little too short, so I kept the 7.5 wide. After wearing them for a few days, I do think the 7 wide would have been a good choice.Even though they are a little more narrow than I expected, because they are leather I think they will stretch. In the mean time I am wearing them with very thin socks.Otherwise these are very well made boots at an unbeatable price. I am wearing them at work (office casual) with pants. They are perfect for this snowy time of year."
193168,1,"It's been a little over a year since I purchased a pair of these shoes in the brown color option in my usual size. I don't wear them on a regular basis--I am generally in skirts and dressier shoes if I am out of the house--but when I travel they are excellent to wear, and they are also fine for trips to the supermarket in colder weather. I wore these shoes almost non-stop when I visited my parents recently and stayed for a few days; they were great for walking around town and window shopping as well as traipsing across fields in the mountains. My left shoe gives me some pain across the top of my foot, I am unsure as to why this is the case, but I laced my shoes up in a 'hackey-sack' configuration so there is less pressure there, and the left shoe is almost comfortable now. During longer treks I still feel some discomfort but I do not blame that on either the shoe or my foot, they just probably are not the best match for each other. But my right foot feels perfectly fine in its Eastland shoe, nice and snug and solid. My grandmother, when she saw me during my trip, asked me if I've grown (I'm in my thirties so that is highly unlikely!), and I said it was the shoes! From looking at them casually on someone's feet you would probably would not notice the height in the sole and heel, as it is not obtrusive, but it is there."
70133,0,"These boots exceeded expectations because they were listed as a costume boot. They are actually almost good enough to wear beyond the Halloween season. The material is synthetic, almost plastic, but the style is pretty cool. They are comfortable with the square toe and medium heel. I think it is a good buy but you kinda get what you pay for in terms of quality."
132313,1,great prices...fast delivery..BUT our daughter wore them only twice for dance class and the strap broke... will contact about this..
55033,1,"I ordered my Keds here because they were available in the size AND color I wanted - which never happens elsewhere. It's hard to find shoes I like that fit my feet because I wear a smallish size and have really deep insteps. But here, I was able to get exactly what I needed - 7 extra wide, red. I'm rocking them with all my favorite outfits and I will definitely be back when I want more."
67570,0,I really like the color. It is a really pretty shoe. My only problem is that it feels so narrow. I bought a wide shoe. And the shoe tongue is very stuff as other reviewers said. Wish they fit better because i love the color.
253825,1,I was very pleased with the selection and price discounts that were available only thru Amazon.com. I really shopped everywhere to find the best deal and selection and Amazon was it! My son says they are awesome!! Size 14's that he likes are hard to find! Thank you!
54417,1,"I never know, when buying shoes over the internet, if they size will be right. These shoes are true to size, good quality, and fit perfectly!"
286159,1,Love them.... So soft and comfy. I have brown ones too. I get a new pair every year in a different color. They are my favorite and they keep your feet so warm.
110592,1,it is light and flexible. perfect match for jeans and even short skirts. I really regretted that I did not buy more in different colors.
382652,1,"I bought a pair of reef flip flops over two years ago, thinking they would just be an okay pair of flip flops to get me through the summer, and I was tired of buying cheap flip flops that only gave me blisters and would get ugly and dirty in no time. When I tried them on they were very comfortable, and despite what most people are saying, for me they were very true-to-size. I normally wear a 7-8 in us womens varying by brand of course, but the size 7 fit me 100% perfect.These flip flops are the most comfortable pair of footwear in general I have ever purchased, and they make me wish I lived somewhere where summer was year-long. I've never blistered, the sole wears perfectly to the shape of your foot, and an fyi for people who hate thong flip flops because of the piece in the middle of your toe (I can get pretty picky about that too depending on brand) .. I've never even felt it being there, because it is made of fabric.Might I just add .. Previously I stated I bought my first pair over two years ago .. and I'm now just considering buying a new pair, not even out of necessary, but because I like the new colors and when I brought my puppy home a year ago he put some tiny little bite marks into the sole.You will not regret this purchase! I will continue to buy reef flip flops for as long as they are still being made!"
303714,1,"These boots have been a huge hit, they made one little girl very happy. She never wants to take them off."
297126,1,I had a pair of these in 1976. I've gone retro and still look good in my stylish comfortable Treks.
45979,1,"I bought four pair of these in different colors. They are the SOFTEST shoes - they just hug your feet and feel like you've slipped a soft little glove over your tootsies! ;-) I have long, narrow feet so being able to get them in my size was a plus as well. I am absolutely delighted with them."
134786,1,"The shoes worked great, right out of the box. I use them for Ultimate, and the first weekend I wore them, they performed nearly flawlessly. I had only worn them for one short hour long practice session before using them for an entire tournament weekend (7 games over two days). So they had not been broken in, and still I only got one hint of a hot spot (blister) on the back of my heel.The tread pattern worked great in the long grass field. The ground was definately soft, and the firm ground cleats dug in consistantly, providing traction in all the various movements required of Ultimate.Great Shoes, great tread pattern, no break in required! Buy 'em."
230629,1,My wife teaches nursing clinicals and needed a great shoe to help her keep up her pace every session. These shoes do the job and then some.
6902,0,"Good looking shoe -- I've worn it about 15 times boating -- they do a good job relative to grip on the boat -- however, the leather is showing wear at this point I didn't expect. The color is fading in some areas and not in others. They shoes appear a lot older than they are."
118800,1,The color and wash of these are so much nicer looking than regular brown loafers you'd find somewhere else.The person I bought them for needed to exchange them for half a size down than his usual.
187925,0,"I love Propet shoes but these were not my style. They are clunky compared to what I have ordered before, maybe I can break them in this summer."
238743,1,"What a genius object, I purchased a pair of ankle string up boots that needed an adjustment, over a year ago. I refused to get rid of them because they are too sexy and subsequently they sat in my closet for a year. I finally surfed amazon for a high heel boot stretcher and thankfully I now can wear my sexy boots thanks to this ingenious little object."
331986,1,"I really like to wear Crocs around the house. They are easy to keep clean--just wash the bottoms with a tooth brush whenever, and dry with a paper towel. I wash the crocs when I wash the floor, and I can walk around while I am mopping without a problem. I feel like the carpets and floors stay clean longer. They are comfortable and easy to get on and off. I am a fan of Crocs!"
291557,1,"The boots I received for child, were high quality and were delivered very quickly. This was my second order from this company and I am pleased with their service."
327552,1,These wrestling shoes are an awesome buy for a great price. And they were delivered faster than expected.
370723,1,"How can you go wrong with traditional Chuck's? I've got several pairs and wear them everywhere from weddings, to school, work and shopping. Jeans and shorts."
162462,1,"Just what I expected. Awesome. I wear a 11.5 in most shoes and got a 12 here on purpose so I could wear thick winter socks. Even with the socks they are a bit roomy in the toe- so believe that &#34;run a half size large&#34; thing for Converse i guess. Other than that, this Pair of Chucks are exactly right on."
55627,1,I originally ordered the wrong size. Amazon arranged an exchange and I am enjoying the sneakers. I always have a good experience with Amazon.
93996,1,"This is a quality lightweight shoe. I think you'd have a hard time finding a shoe of this type, as well made, at any price range. Very comfortable, very stylish."
327299,1,"Earth shoes are wonderful. They provide enough room in the toe box and good arch support. I have bought many athletic shoes and Earth shoes are the only ones that seem to accomodate my feet. The only reason I gave them a 4 is because they seem to run a little long and are quite stiff. Even with that being said, they still are a very comfortable shoe. I use them for walking and hope to work up to some light jogging since my daughter entered me in a 5 mile run walk in 6 weeks."
361866,1,"I have purchased a number of high end sneakers over the last few years, but always go back to this particular brand for comfort and quality. I have also purchased dress shoes in this brand and had great results. I seem to have issues with the toes being a bit pinched or some other problem making the shoe not a great fit-except with this brand. A friend told me about Easy Spirit a few years ago, she buys this brand regularly also. Great quality and fit."

294199,1,"This is my first pair of Minnetonka moccasins, which I purchased to replace my beloved L.L. Bean 'wicked good' fleece-lined moccasins. These moosehide mocs are very well-made, with a substantial sole. The leather is thick but supple, the stitching is secure with no loose/fraying ends, and the soles provide excellent grip, even on wet surfaces. They run a little small, so I'd recommend ordering a half-size larger--and wider--than one's ""regular"" shoes. These moccasins are shoes, not slippers, and will need to be worn with socks, I believe: they are not lined and don't 'breathe' well, lending themselves to sticking to the feet. That all said, though, these moccasins are VERY comfortable, the chocolate (the color I bought) are really good-looking, and they should hold up well, given the quality of the materials used. These haven't actually replaced my Bean moccasins (which I always wore without socks), but have given me a new pair of weekend knock-around shoes that are both comfortable and good-looking."
325032,1,"the reason why the Copa Mundial has been on the market for 25+ years is that it is the best soccer shoe available.The leather stays in fantastic shape, even when you can't find the time to mink-oil it. The shoe withstands all-weather conditions. I've played in snow, blistering heat in the desert, rainstorms, mud, everything. These shoes recover nicely and have given me plenty of mileage.My first pair gave out on me after four or five full seasons playing year-round. The stitching around the sole of the shoe gave out on me. My next pair of Copas picked right up where the others left off-- no blisters on my feet or ankles. Like wearing a house slipper, which are what soccer shoes are supposed to feel like.I will only buy Copas as long as they are available."
209748,1,"At first I wasn't sure whether or not I could work all day in these boots. They fit perfectly but had a couple spots that rubbed my foot and ankle causing irritation. After about a week these boots were broke in and couldn't be any more comfortable. Best boot ever, great support and feel. Will continue to buy this boot in future"
249553,0,"First purchase of this style..seem to run big size wise, also very stiff feeling slipper,however they are well made..just not as comfortable as others I have owned."
29711,0,"I had been holding out from buying Crocs for a while. Several family members already owned them and really liked them. When I got an Amazon gift card, I figured it was time to give these universally considered, ""ugly"" clogs a try. I figured that if I were going to wear something that went so against fashion sense, I'd might as well advertise my fanaticism by buying a pair of the collegiate beach clogs. I exchanged them within a week for regular beach clog Crocs.From the moment I received my Collegiate Crocs, I wore them day and night for about a week. One day when I was showing them off to someone, I noticed that the college logo was peeling off! The logos are basically just very thin adhesives that don't appear to be durable. Think of the temporary tattoos that little kids put on their arms. I called Crocs directly and they told me that they had new Collegiate Crocs that supposedly had the logos ""stamped"" on and should be more durable. I didn't want to deal with paying for shipping back to Crocs and Amazon didn't carry the other version so I just returned them and purchased normal Crocs from a Crocs kiosk at the mall.Functionally, Crocs have been a godsend on my plantar fasciitis. After over a year of only wearing Crocs and sneakers with special inserts, my plantar fasciitis is almost gone. They are darn durable, but I have had tan bark from playgrounds actually slightly pierce the bottom of the clog and come through to the top. Ouchey!If you are seeking comfort in a reasonably priced beach clog, Crocs are amazing. Just don't expect your Collegiate Crocs to show your college pride for long."
88884,1,"I like the extra height these platforms give me; I purchased them in my usual size 8, but I was sliding out of them too easily and was afraid of falling (that's why I gave them 4 stars). But I liked them enough to exchange them for a size 7, which fit me much better. I've worn them for only 2 days so far -- they are heavier than regular shoes but not too heavy and I think I'll enjoy wearing them."
301992,1,"i rarely wear tennis shoes so all i wear is sandels and reef is my number one choice. i like these sandels because they give me height and don't look as casual like other reef products. it takes a coulple of days to get your feet adjusted, but once you do you will be very pleased. i still have my origional pair from two and a half years ago."
93531,1,"I have very flat feet and have all my life. I've had corrective surgery to align my feet, but they're still flat. Because they're flat, my feet are also prone to ligament inflammation without proper support. All of these factors considered, I live in a constant struggle to find a comfortable shoe. I usually wear tennis shoes with custom orthotics in them, but for a day at the beach, this is a problem. I can't hold flip flops on comfortably (and they have absolutely no support!) so I needed a sandal that could hold itself on. I tried Columbia Techsun 2 sandals, which I thought would be great, until I walked through the Bahamas in misery and ended up with blisters.I researched walking sandals for hours and hours until I finally settled on the Keens. They are a bit pricey, but any shoe that I can walk in without pain is totally worth it to me. I've never had a more comfortable pair of shoes straight out of the box. It's rare that I find shoes that I can wear for miles and not have something rub me or that make my knees and back ache. They'd be cuter without the big black toe guard, but I'll probably come to appreciate that feature of the shoe. (It would be nicer if it was the same color as the straps of the shoe.) I bought them to use on trips, but I have a feeling that when summer comes, these will be the only shoes on my feet. I've already raved so much about them that I'm ordering a pair for my husband right now!My husband and I both wore these on a recent trip to the Caribbean and they were invaluable. In San Juan, Puerto Rico, I walked at least 8 miles in my Keens and didn't even think about my feet. They were so comfortable and I was especially impressed with the grip of the soles on wet rocks. At the end of the day, I was so happy that I didn't have any blisters and my feet still felt good. I also wore these on the beach in the Bahamas and they dried very quickly in the sun. I will never take a trip without these shoes again! I'm now thinking that I need these in other colors!If you have flat feet or fallen arches, I would recommend these shoes for you. I couldn't be happier with them!"
100099,1,"I love these shoes for casual wear. Looked almost broken in upon receipt, but I guess I am pleased overall."
224732,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
172639,0,Just arrived and best described as a slipper.No separate insole or structure. The soles are very narrow so the upper in the D width must hang over the edge. I have been wearing deerskin moccasins for 50 years or so. The quality seems to be going downhill.
89027,1,"I am on my fourth pair of the Asic 2070. I wore it to train and walk in a 3-Day 60 mile walk for breast cancer. All my teammates had miserable blisters and shinsplints on the walk, all except myself and one another teammate. We were wearing the Asic 2070. Although made for running, the Asic 2070 is comfortable, durable and light weight, all the important features in a shoe for a serious walker."
41349,1,"Reefs are my favorite flip flop..Comfortable from day one. Not rubbing and pain between toes.Great arch support for foot comfort.Footbed provides soft support.Good traction, wore these on a tour of a cavern.Good for the beach, don't mind getting wet.Reefs are better than other more pricey brands."
369571,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
384598,1,"Son perfectas las recomiendo a todas esas personas que busquen calidad , comodidad , buen precio , listas para airsoft!"
32926,1,"I bought this sandal after I broke my toe, and I wanted a sandal with toe protection, and I wasn't disappointed. This sandal is really comfortable. It has great arch support and a nicely coushioned sole, and it is both cute and functional. Looks great with shorts, capris and pants, but a little too ""clunky"" for skirts. Very sporty."
68890,0,"The title kind of sums up my feeling about these boots. The leather is very thin and I feel that they will not last very long, but they look great and have ZERO break-in time. Coupled with some decent insoles they are easily my most comfortable dress boots. I'm constantly getting complimented on their look, but I wish the leather were a bit sturdier."
243950,0,The sizing is way off! My daughter is a 4. Ordered the 5 - too tight. Exchanged for the 6 - too loose but keeping. Would prefer to buy in a store but couldn't find.
10507,0,"This isn't the best ballet shoe I've ever had, but it's not the worst either. It's just pretty average. I wear a size 7.5 street shoe so I ordered a 7.5 for this shoe. The length is just a little short, but my ballet shoes always stretch after a while, so I think this will be fine. However, they're way too wide for my feet even with the strings tied as tight as I can get them. Also, the elastics are already sewn on even though the picture doesn't show them that way. I wish they weren't, because they're not exactly in the right place for me. The shoes are made in Thailand for those interested in country of origin. They're an ok shoe, but I won't get them again when these wear out because the sizing is too awkward and the elastics are pre-sewn."
236899,1,"I've been eyeing the graphite colored Keds for awhile now and I am not disappointed that I finally bought them!I am normally a size 9 to 9.5 in shoes, and because of the loose fit from a previous pair of size 9.5 Keds, I went with a size 9. So they fit perfectly. I've worn them walking around the city a few times and have had no pressure points/no blisters/no sore spots. That's the ultimate test for me--comfort in walking. Well, they definitely passed the test."
336394,0,Although these shoes are really very nice looking they are unfortunately one of the most uncomfortable pair of shoes I have tried to wear. They're ok for a couple of hours as long as you do not need to wald a distance.
208943,2,"The shoes are no good the glue in the front part of the shoe needs fixing I have this shoes not even a month, they say I have to return the shoes not used well, the problem happen afther i wore them, so 56.00 down the drain. not buying from this seller again."
171381,1,"True to size, very comfortable, the color (I love it) is just like the picture. I wish all my sneakers felt as good on my feet as these do. And I will buy more if they come on sale."
210759,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
129951,1,"I bought these shoes about a week ago, all I can say is WOW! They fit me like a glove and although they do get a bit uncomfortable after wearing them for a long time, they look amazing. the looks I get totally makes the sore feet worth it."
11403,1,just got these boots and they are comfortable and even nicer looking than the photo. I have very wide feet with really high arches and these boots fit right out of the box. They feel like I already broke them in. These are going to be great for pants or skirts. I'm very happy with them.
110464,1,I bought these for my dad for christmas. Just to go ice fishing and snowblowing and wood splitting. He loves them. Awesome material great fit
286045,1,I ordered these Boots and received them in a decent amount of time. No problems - good service was received.
2159,0,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
177679,1,"I researched a long time for a good running shoe last year and ended up with this one. I know you're supposed to replace them every so often, so I went to my running store to ask what shape they were in. They were so helpful: I noticed the back was worn down on the outsides, but they said that is normal for just about every runner. I noticed the bottom treads were still in good shape, but he explained that it's the EVA cushioning INSIDE that breaks down over time. Then he asked... did your knees hurt? your shins? your feet? I hadn't thought about it but in the past I HAD had some minor pain, but nothing when using this shoe. He recommended I buy the exact same pair again and that's what I'm going to do. I hate that because it's so boring, but hey, whatever works, right?"
331392,0,"Received them on time, just a little big, thought they would fit like my other pair that are an XL- 10-11 men. I ordered 11 men, should've went 10 men, oh well, they will still work for what i'm using them for."
20752,0,"I love Propet shoes but these were not my style. They are clunky compared to what I have ordered before, maybe I can break them in this summer."
119214,2,"I bought a pair of Women's Plainview less than a year ago. I only wore them occasionally during cold-weather months, so that the upper part is still very new and nice. Yet, I just found out that the sole of the left one has broken and there is a huge gap there, which easily allows a tiny amount of water seep through and wet the foot.Considering that it is still a relatively new pair of shoes, I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the brand. I don't expect shoes to last forever, but at least lasting a few months should be the bottom line. This brand does not meet that minimum requirement."
105014,1,"I really like these shoes! These are really comfortable. I walk and stand, a lot, during my day and need a shoe that has some cushion and support. These are perfect in that regard. I have a slightly narrow foot and usually order an average (M) width. I find these shoes run a little to the narrow side. You may want want to order the wide width."
181986,1,"I bought these boots in dark brown 6 years ago direct from Danner for $132 shipped. Initially, I thought that I would use them for day hikes and such. While they are definitely rugged enough for hiking and have miles of trails on them at this point, they are not too bulky for everyday use. In fact, I wear these things all the time and after more than 6 years of use, you can hardly tell. I wear them to work, in the yard, out and about, basically everywhere. They have taken the punishment of the trails, the snow, ice, mud, etc. and still look good enough to wear to the office. They are extremely comfortable, light, completely waterproof, and have required no maintenance--not even new laces. I'm a huge believer in Danner boots, I have worn them daily for years at work, but never believed that these lightweight Danners would deliver the way their stitch down leather boots do. I was wrong. While this type of sole cannot be replaced making them in essence disposable boots, with the way they have stood up over the past 6 years, I expect to get more than my money's worth. Take it from someone who is really, really particular about footwear, these are great boots."
204518,1,i was looking everywhere for a deal and found the m VERY CHEAP priced here. overall the shoes look very cool and are extremely light. im used to vans shoes that feel heavy on the feet but these shoes are very light and thin as if walking on air. i like them so far. not bad at all.
336554,1,"I was looking for a good walking sandal that could be adjusted in case my feet were swollen (as often happens after flying). These were comfortable right away, the size was good, wore them every day and they were always comfortable, no blisters forming. Very happy with them, and would purchase other Propet products."
152126,0,"My shoe size is a 7 1/2, but if shoes only come in whole sizes I order up to an 8. These shoes fit like a 7 rather than an 8. Had to return them, too short, too narrow. My last Keens in an 8 (different style) fit perfectly."
123237,1,"I could not find replacement strings anywhere, so naturally I tried Amazon. They had an approved store front so I felt comfortable doing business with them. I received the laces in record time."
15905,1,"Timberland is a good product. I have a few pairs of shoes from Timberland. Theses boots do have a solid fit, as one customer stated, but the fit is very comfortable! Gives a sold footing with walking in the unpredictable winter weather. Highly recommended. The price is extremely low for a Timberland product. This boot is a winner!"
97664,1,My son is on pair four. He loves the comfort of this shoe. Oddly enough he needs a shoe horn to put them on but once on they are like a comfy glove. Sadly it looks like they are phasing out and the black and white ones are rare to find which are the only ones he'll wear.
210298,1,I had to get a full size smaller but they are really cute. They are almost black in color which is why I rated it 4/5. I ordered the navy ones and I usually wear 7.5 but got these in 6.5.
380130,1,"comfortable shoe for a great price. I read the reviews and ordered a half size bigger, in wide instead of regular. It fits perfectly!"
243535,1,"The shoes were great, but I have such a small feet they were too big. Sorry I had to return them."
230112,1,I stand on my feet for 7 hours at a time in a professional job. This is my shoe w/ a walking insole inside I work it out just fine and no one notices I have on sneaks! I am on my fourth pair and looking for several replacements. Works great w/ slacks or khaki pants. (make sure if you are getting them as an alternative to a ladies dress shoe get the all blk w/ the all blk gumsole and all blk laces) Most dress shoes for ladies are very very uncomfortable even though they are fashionable and this one does both very well. The fact that I can machine wash makes them even more likeable.
67672,1,I bought the wheat and the black Nellie ankle boots. I have big ankles and they fit comfortably the very first time I put them on.I didn't have to wear them two or three times to break them in.
190314,1,"I ordered some k Swiss for my daughter and I love them, they look so cute on her and the price was even better!!!!"
388744,1,I bought these shoes before and they served me well for over a year. They fit well and needs very little break in. Very comfortable.
11541,1,Recently bought New Balance MW627 - not a great color but excellent fit - light weight and a great price.
296165,1,This is an excellent product for anyone who lives where it snows or it's icy. Last year I slipped on our ice in the driveway so I thought I'd give these a try. It's just like walking on dry land. Incredible!! They are easy to put on but definetly take them off in your garage or outside before you walk into your house because they will rip the crap out of your flooring!!
45944,1,Propet breeze walker sandals were received as described ... before estimated delivery date. Would order this product again.
275990,1,Great shoe my first skate shoe like 12 years ago stoked that i came aross it at this low price.
333129,1,"Good traction, and you can feel where your foot is in relation to the ground. The laces are secure and don't flop around.Very good product."
256094,1,These shoes fit my wife perfectly and feel very comfortable. She even wears them to the gym in place of sneakers.
99434,1,nice shoes : Very comfortable and true to size. Does not look like cheap plastic which most other inexpensive loafers do.
49591,1,"these boots are awesome as long as you know how to walk in heels lol but other than that they fit nicely though i would recommend getting something soft to put in them, with heels that high it puts a lot of pressure on the upper half of your foot so you need something in there or you will only be able to wear them for about 30 min and have to take them off. but yeah over all these boots are very well put together, they are sturdy, and i am happy with my purchase"
104194,0,"I used to wear this Newport style a lot several years ago. But had forgotten about them until I was searching for some comfortable shoes with support to wear during my third trimester of pregnancy. This pair ended up being too large (slipped in the heel), but I would have returned them even if they had fit because they are too clunky for my style now."
85926,1,"The service was unbelievably easy, and the product was shipped sooo fast! Thank you! This was my first purchase but it won't be my last"
183518,1,Very please with my boots .I usely wear a 5E and the 3EEE fits like a glove.Has a nice shine and finish .Excellent quality boots.Thanks Double-H and Amazon came to the rescue again.A very happy camperDavid M. from the cold country
81252,1,"Make you run faster, jump higher, stand straighter.This is my fourth pair of flyers (third red!). I wear them till they wear out, which is usually at least 2 years."
56964,0,These sneakers are OK....don't know if these are original or knock offs...fit is not the same as the Keds I remember!

108144,1,My three pairs of SAS shoes arrived this afternoon 2/9/11. I am happy with the speedy service and quality of product. I will order from Papa Shoes the next time I need SAS shoes.
236001,1,"I purchased these for my 13 year old. They were instantly comfortable, and he wears them everywhere."
359090,1,"thanks for the offer, I really like these crocs. come on! why do i have to do this? enough already!"
155325,1,I have had these boots now for about 1 week. They fit well and are pretty close to broke in. The boots are light weight and can be worn in all day without feeling like you have 2 bricks tied to your feet. But if your looking for more tread you might want to try a different Justin boot.
365313,1,"Very good sneakers, the most comfortable ever. And also one of the cheapest! I'd like to try some of the new Converse models"
258065,1,"I ordered this shoe in white, I was very skeptical because of the price, but I was not disappointed, they were comfortable I loved them they set my black bubble dress off, I got tons of compliments. LOVE these shoes I will be ordering 2 more pair of them the red and the black"
303798,0,"I mistakenly ordered the wrong width, have reordered it but havn't recieved it yet, I hope it fits as it is a nice well made thong."
252731,1,Receiver??? You are denied!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Adidas plus talented corner back equals devistating defense and victory against any offense!! Adidas is Victory!!
342758,1,"the only problem i had with this shoe was the sizing, i usually wears 8 or 8.5 but the size i bought was 5.5 so it was a little bit unusual!!!"
235396,1,"The process for finding this shoe on the web site was easy and straight-forward. I received a confirming email from both Amazon and Shoe Mall. The shoes arrived within a week and are just as illustrated online. For me they are a tad snug, but I expect that to lessen as I wear them. I plan to order again from this vendor."
125754,1,"Reebok its that I want. You can wear those everywhere during the day. But they run small maybe for a number. I use to wear 9, but they didn't feet in my feet. so Think about this if you are going to buy these shoes."
27456,1,I love these little ballet slippers/shoes. I got them to go with her Pink easter dress and they got so many compliments. They are completely adorable! Worth the price!
76092,1,I have owned these sandals before and just love how comfortable they are. I have tried very hard to find ones to compare with being as comfortable when wearing to do shopping and to do anything for a long time. I would definitely recommend them for comfort and durability.
301060,1,"Bought these for my two year old granddaughter. So far they've held up nicely through several early season campouts in the Wash. Cascades. She's worn them in the rain with her rainsuit, and splashing in puddles when it wasn't raining, but the boots kept her feet dry as advertised. And they look adorable on her as well! Great service, fast shipping, overall an excellent online purchase."
378496,1,The shoes arrived quickly and as described. They are very comfortable& a quality product. They do tend to run a half size small so if you order them get them a half size larger. Beautiful craftmanship.
162873,1,"I love these slippers but they run large. They are so comfortable, soft and warm. I highly recommend them. The color is the same as the photo by the way. Often they are not."
1824,1,"I have arthritis in my hips and knees. I am on my feet, all day, every day working for Fred Meyer. I walk many miles, on hard floors and, it was getting so I could hardly walk at the end of the day. At the end of the week, I was ready to die. I purchased these boots on the first day of a vacation and, decided I'd wear them during the vacation to break them in, so I wouldn't have to go through the ""new shoe pain"" at work. Well, there was never any painful breakin period. The boots felt fantastic from the start. Now, my hips and knees don't hurt at work. At all! These boots have made a terrific difference in my quality of life. I went out today, and purchased another pair, so I can switch them out so they'll last longer, and get to air out. I can't say enough good things about these boots and, can't think of a thing negative to say, either. I, honestly, may purchase a third pair just for the heck of it."
246687,1,"These shoes are cute and comfortable, although they run a tad small. I hope they'll stretch out a little with wear."
245712,1,"I am enjoying my purchase. This is the 4th time I have bought this same comfortable shoe, but my first purchase of shoes online. I knew the shoe & the size before I ordered & the price was right. Delivery was in about 5 days with free super saver shipping."
258429,1,"Lord, could Converse have got it any more right? One thinks not. The Converse All Star Chuck Taylor canvas shoes are everything one could need from a shoe and more. They are stylish, available in colours that vary from orange to pink, the more comtemporary leather versions, low cut and high cut. These baby's contour the foot so well,it's almost like walking on air! The canvas hugs the ankles, providing support...but the most important features of the shoes are that they are unisex (they look great on guys and girls) and they can be dressed down with jeans, or elegantly dressed up with a pair of tailored pants. These shoes are definitely to die for."
138650,1,"Comfortable and pretty too. However, not recommend buying from amazon. I found one in the store is cheaper..."
276171,1,We use Hi-Tec boots and shoes for storm chasing. They've always made an excellent lightweight hiking boot. The Altitude IV is rough and tough but also looks good for a night out on the town. We get our boots dirty as we trek across Tornado Alley each spring. Our Hi-Tec's take good care of our feet as we concentrate on the weather.Martin LisiusTempest Tours Storm Chasing Expeditions
128053,1,"I wear work boots most of the day. However, when introduced to the Keen, I may have been reluctant at first, but found that it is a great shoe to wear after a long work day. I like that it is easy to put on, goes with many summer outfits, and has the protective toe to keep my foot safe (and my shyness of wearing sandals a bit more discreet). Very easy to clean and care for also!"
384625,1,These are some very comfortable boots. I am a hot natured person and these boots are cool. I love the zipper on the side. It makes getting the boots off and on easy.
50370,1,"I really enjoy the boots and the price was great. Like with any boot, getting the correct size is difficult without being fitted. I went with my usual size, and they didn't fit as comfortably as I would have liked. I made some adjustments with insoles and they became increasingly more comfortable. I recommend going to a boot fitter who sells the brand you are buying prior to making the purchase. In terms of style, appearance, and affordability, these boots are fantastic."
118893,1,i was lookig of 335 so i found the 338 and i love itthe price is ok
153875,1,These boots are very comfortable and well made. And you really can order a size smaller than you usually wear and still get a perfect fit. One caution though I realize these boots stretch but I would think anyone with a much above average calf circumference would have some trouble pulling these boots up. Otherwise these are a great product and well worth the price.
139943,0,I love the styling of this shoe. I wear a 10 but these feel like an 8.I am not willing to part with my toes to wear these cute shoes.
305382,0,"These were a good deal for the price paid, though they seem to run a half size smaller than labeled."
323049,1,"I was lucky enough to track down a pair of 52s, which converts to about a size 16 US. I have a very wide foot and these shoes are extremely comfortable and roomy. A previous reviewer complained about looseness, but a loose shoe might be too big for the rider. If it's the clip, that's easy enough to change with another type of clip or by tightening the clip."
357581,1,these are great and fit true to size...not too high for dancing...color is close to skin and blends nicely with my leg
197520,1,Ordered these for my granddaughter who is thrilled. They arrived in a short amount of time. Great service.
17025,1,Great pair of boots. I buy one every year for my son who plays 5 days a week in them. They last longer that the pretty boots and give a better grip that the blaves on the harder grounds that we play on hrer.
364797,1,"They're Chuck Taylor's. If you'll like them, you'll love these. Black high-top sneakers were a great gift for the scene girl with black everything"
371632,1,it looks really cool and really comforible. everything on it is great except sometimes there will be some dirt that sticks to the dark black part in the front even if im not walking by dirt.
201528,1,Terrifically comfortable shoes. I wear mine to work in the office. (I am a physician in private practice.)
128090,1,"I love these COW GIRL boots. The price was right, they are comfie and lots of compliments"
59239,1,"I've tried many types of boots in my day. By profession I am a miner and work six days a week. I have never found a boot that I can take out of the box and take off to work in. The hi-Tec boot that I bought I allowed three weeks to break in. When I would get home, till I went to bed, even going to the store, you name it. I also gave them a good dose of mink oil often. I have seen many reveiws about how stiff the leather is and sole issues. If your boot has no wrinkles in the stress points it's not broke in and will be uncomfortable. My first hike was five hours at twenty five degrees steep, unstable rock and leaf covered slopes and my boots worked as I would have expected. The soles stayed soft enough to grip the rocks and provided good ankle support. I have always worn Red Wing boots at the mine site but won't any more as they have changed the soles to a hard rubber that won't grip and I hate them. The soles look like new after two years(over two hundred dollar boots). I'm breaking in my Hi-Tec for the Grand Teton range and I'm sure that I have made the right choice. If you do buy a pair of Hi-Tec boots make sure you BREAK THEM IN before you judge them. As for me, my ""Altitude IV"" won't be my last, I love them."
242481,1,Ive been wearing converse all stars for over 20 years and still love them. Ive also found they make a nice driving shoe because there thin and you can feel the pedals. If youve never had a pair its time to try.
214924,1,"These shoes are incredibly comfortably, and look awesome. I was skeptical at first, but ever since I have received my pair of Red/White/Blue, I have not found a single flaw. These shoes will bring the old school back into your life and then some. Get a couple pairs of these things and wear a different color each day!"
111291,1,I love these boots and I have received so many compliments. The style is great and so is the fit. I don't like high heals so this is perfect. very nice quality of leather.
220416,0,"I have been waiting over 2 week s to received a return label in the mail as my printer is down. I have called atleast 4x regarding this label.I am still waiting. The shoe is well made, Great price but not my style."
367279,0,"This is a fair performing shoe for basketball players. The shoe itself is a little clunky and not very responsive to quick cuts. It should be worn if you are playing at the guard positions; heavier players should definitely stay away from this shoe, because there is not enough cushioning and support for their weight. Overall, it's a fair shoe and very reasonably priced."
121143,1,"As it has always been hard to find shoes in my width that are comfortable, I hesitated to buy these shoes when they were full price.But while searching on Amazon.com, I discovered these shoes at a much reduced price so took a chance.I LOVE THEM!The only complaints I have are that I wish the heel was a little narrower and I wish that the toe was a tad bit wider. Otherwise, they are great. I did not have to break them in like alot of shoes.Being 62 yrs old, but still feeling ""Forever Young"",this style is casual enough to wear with jeans, and is still a bit stylish as well.I definetly would suggest them to a friend and would order them again."
16154,0,"These are some of the cutest shoes my daughter has! However, they are very hard to put on! The back is always folding in, making the process of putting shoes on, very long...especially for slip on shoes."
285632,1,"Great cross training sneaker! I'm not a runner... I wear them to the gym for all sorts of classes and the eliptical. I have awful feet that blister and turn red instatly with any new shoes, but these fit really nicely. I got the wide which I think helped. They look really sharp too! Highly recommend."
90891,1,The shoes are versatile and very comfortable. Sizing is accurate and the price is right. I am pleased with my purchase. Good buy.
210657,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
79700,1,"My daughter and I loved these shoes so much, she wanted a pair. She loves these more than the high top version she got previously. They are great shoe and versatile. I used to wear converse style shoes all the time when I was in high school, so it was fun to get another pair again. They fit comfortable, and felt true to size to me. Although a lot of people are saying they are not true to size. Because of that, my daughter and I bought the wrong sizes twice. So it confuses me why so many people are saying the sizing is off. So I am throwing my two cents in for that reason.My feet are about a 7 (one foot is a little longer than the other) and normal width. I'm not overweight nor extremely thin. I ordered the womens 7/ mens 5 and they feel just right. My daughter also ordered the size most closest to her foot size and she said they fit better than the other two pair we tried to over/under compensate with. Good luck!"
257420,1,"These shoes were a Xmas present for my daughter. Even though she did pick them out, you always wonder how well they will be liked. She said that she wore them all night long and truely loved them. I am thinking about another pair for her."
135841,0,this is my first time ordering shoes from this site last time i ordered some shoes from a different site and they were nothing like they previewed on the site anyway i'm ordering now and i'll complete my review when i get the shoe so everyone will know if the companies full of it or not peace
334974,0,These shoes are very light and appear durable. I had hoped for more spring in the step. I find that it is difficult to tie the shoes with the tightness I prefer.
380309,0,"It's a very good product (Capezio), high quality but the heel is too high for students that are doing character dancing for the first time; beginners should start with a 3/4"" heel... ...unfortunatelly, I just learned that!"
326788,1,"I went on a trip last June to DC, NYC, and Philly ...it was swelteringly hot and humid ..the other so-called ""walking"" shoes I bought were useless! ..big brand name expensive things . gave me blisters. .I wore these flip flops for hours and hours and hours . . while walking around all three cities. . .and . they still appear to be in great shape! ..I'm looking to buy a few more pairs ..I've never been this rhapsodic about a pair of shoes .but ..when you are traveling . .and have sore feet ..nothing is worse . ..these rock!"
199272,1,Bought 2 pair of these. One for a friend and one for a family member. These are some hot looking shoes. They hold up great. I cant imagine how many miles my nephew put on his before he wore the tread off. That boy ran in these everyday like Forrest Gump. He still has them but i took him and bought him a new pair. New Balance are great shoes!
210570,1,I've ordered the black color last year and there were perfect.I also recently order the another pair brown color and noticed a little difference in quality. I was surprised when discovered that black one is made in BRAZIL but brown one is made in CHINA. Strange.......
389118,1,"I'm so glad I brought these shoes for my father because he's been wanting a pair for so long, so I got them and he loves them. They're a great Shoe for a great price."
61679,1,"These shoes were just as I expected. They do seem to run about a half size small, though. They do seem well made. Thanks!"
289416,1,"best shoes i've bought. Rollbar technology works wonders for the normal person, keeps your heel stable and supports. Great if you have fallen arches or are overweight.New Balance make the truest sized shoes out there, and in wide sizes. Highly recommended..."
377111,1,"ispent 270 bucks on a pair of boots that are too big for me! i ordered a size 12 which is what i wear in all foot wear..i got these and my toe is a little past thelaces on the toe of the boot. however, Danner is such a superior product that even having too big of size, they are still super comfortable and dont kill my feet. the waterproofing is water proof and they are pretty warm too. MAKE SURE YOU ARE GETTING THE SIZE YOU NEED BEFORE PURCHASE!"
74923,1,"These sandals are very comfortable and I am very pleased with this purchase. Shipping was speedy. I do feel, however, that the size ran a little small."
259518,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
44888,1,"These shoes will not dry quickly, but they're great for a walk, regardless of terrain. They look really good, too."
328344,1,"I bought these shoes for my mom, and she is the pickiest shoe shopper ever! She absolutely loves the comfort of these shoes and hadnt been able to find them for years! Good thing there is amazon! She hasn't been able to find shoes as comfortable! She says size are true to size, and she wants me to buy another two pairs! Good to know I've made my mom happy!"
147352,1,My shoe size is 61/2 I ordered a 7. It is too small. Otherwise great boots. I will return them and order an 8
261718,1,"I love Converse and this is my ninth pair. Not of the shoe of the same color though. I'm fairly meticulous about taking care of my shoes so all of the ones I own (some for more than 5 years!) still look brand new with moderate wear. They're comfartable, durable, versatile, and flat out cool. Go buy them if you've never owned a pair!"
255761,1,I bought this shoe for my daughter who is in pre school. It looks great with her uniform and she hasn't complained of any discomfort:-)
7996,2,I ordered these boots in size 12 m regular toe. They came in a box marked 12 m but the boots were 10 m. They did not fit also they had steel toes that I did not want. I do like these boots I have had 4 pairs that I bought from Sears over the years. I thought I would save some money online but it didn't work out. Just a wast of time. I went back to Sears
35713,1,"These shoes fit great, look great, and are very comfortable. What more can you ask for??"
160372,1,bought to replace some cheaper versions from bass pr* these are so lightweight it feels like slippers only complaint was does not have lip on back to help pull offand what is it with the yellow line on top? prefer green all the way to the top for concealment other wise will buy again
144436,1,Have two daughters and both have a this boot. Is well made stylish and holds up to wear and tear. Older daughter has had hers almost 2 years and still fashionable and little wear.
367511,1,"I don't have too much carpet to vacumn, so this is perfect for me. I tried several other kinds but I don't like the heavy weight monster vacumn at all. There is only one master bedroom upstairs, and living room down stair come with Carpet, so ez to carry it every where. I am suprised how it work, it could clean my kitchen, stairs, and even wood floor very well. The only thing I worried about is the battery life, it takes hours to recharge, but last for about an hours or so. Good enought for me though."
190611,0,"The shoes are comfortable, but they do not look pretty. If you are seeking comfort only, then it's good. If you want to look great too, you need to spend more money I guess."
219238,1,"I used them twenty times until I got tired of them especially as what the other reviewers had written--the smallest toe goes out from the gap on the side. I gave them away. The leather is of fine quality, but the strap is not big enough for me, a lot of times the snap becomes unfastened."
371193,0,"The shipping fast, the product came in the right size that i ordered. The shoes are great I love them. Only problem is they sent me a different variation of this product than what is pictured. The stitching shown in the toe area that looks like a ""cowboy style"" is replaced by a rounded curved line. I bought these over a cheaper model to get that ""cowboy v"" stitch and received the cheaper model anyways... should have ordered them elsewhere and saved 5 to 10 dollars."
38001,0,Sent it back because it made my feet look even bigger. Did not fit well either. The support was comfortable but did not like the look on me.
333268,0,"This might sound weird, but these shoes are too sguishy. When I am taking my daily run, my shoes always hurt because it is too squishy!!"
213876,1,Wonderful pair of shoes...I wore them to work today and it was just like they were my old friend. I would highly recommend Clark shoes to EVERYONE
99743,1,"Excellent value item, and the order arrived almost instantly. I love these classic designed Oxfords, since they are perfect for wearing spats."
2187,1,"I puchased a pair of these for a 16 mile hiking trip. out of the box, no joke, these were(are) the most comfortable pieces of footwear i have ever had on my feet. as for the water proof part, i have found these boots are superior! during my hike it rained overnight and the next morning hiking through mud and rain my feet stayed completely dry. i also purchased another pair of these for work and daily wear because they are so comfortable, and part of my job as an auto-body technician is detailing a car after it is painted for customer pick-up. the drain in the shop at work is very poor, and during washing a car, u find yourself standing in a 2 inch puddle of water and my feet stay dry all day in these boots.i would also like to add that your feet stay warm in these boots. i usually wear normal socks, but when i go hiking or camping i wear warm thick socks. either way your feet stay warm"
361818,1,"MY HUSBAND WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BOOT AND I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PRICE AND ALSO THAT THEY ACTUALLY FIT HIM. YEAH,,, HE IS HARD TO BUY SHOES FOR. SHIPPING WAS GOOD BUT HAD NO RETURN LABLE IN CASE THEY DIDN'T FIT JUST SO YOU KNOW. HOWEVER, I WAS THRILLED THAT WE DIDN'T NEED ONE. THANKS SO MUCH.. WE SAVED FIFTY DOLLARS ORDERING THESE FROM AMAZON."
355062,1,"Wonderful sneakers! They are comfortable and stylish. They run slightly large ( I wear a size 7 shoe, so I ordered a 7). They are very roomie, but comfortable and I can wear thick socks with them if I need to."
108233,0,"If your looking for a sandal / flip-flop to last more than a summer look at other options. I love sandals and this is my third pair of Reefs, they are very, very comfortable and served their purpose for a summer of use. After 3 months of wearing them around the house, out on short treks and basically hanging out they worked great. Reef always has the cool surf styling too. I was just hoping this pair would last more than a year to wear around the house during the winter, not the case, the right and left heels are almost completely worn through. Great sandals short term but I'd shell out the extra 10 or 15 bucks for something you'll get more wear out of."
88965,0,"It's just ok, but nothing more than the other shoe trees. And mine came a bit broken.Still I use it, it's fine, even though broken, but nothing like &#34;whoa, this is amazing&#34;"
357279,1,Love the black lower edge color. I have a couple sore spots after wearing all day. The past keds fit a little better. Wonderful shoes otherwise.
292810,1,The shipping was fast and the shoe was true to size. Thank you so much! I now have a new favorite pair of shoes :)
70226,1,Product is of very high quality. Shoes are comfortable and versatile. Oops! Did I forget to mention the value? Great job.
251082,1,"I am on my second pair after wearing the first pair almost every day for 6 years - sometimes treating them very roughly (like tromping around in them in the mud and rain). They finally started showing wear (crack in the side of the foorbed near the forward strap and nearly all the soul minus the centers). But they are still super comfy. If you have any foot problems or you just want to treat your feet like you value them - these are the ticket. They are more comfy than my Clarks or Mephistos, Danskos, Soffts... Maybe not quite as stylish (LOL). The only thing I could bring up is that if you have any problems with pain on the top of your foot if something rubs on it then there might be a problem or a break in period for these shoes because the strap where it buckles has a small lip that will rub ever so slightly on the top of your foot.Also, about the regular berkies versus the ones with the extra cushion (the name escapes me) - I have the originals (my old ones) and the cushies (for the new pair) and cannot tell the difference. BUT the new cushies make a swooshing sound when I walk like air is being released. I think that will end after a while (I hope) after it molds to my foot. But it CAN be loud."
73376,1,"Excellen.........comfy, easy to clean, and they float if you drop them in the water..........."
284028,1,"This is a very nice shoes and I had this so cheap,and it's so comfortable,good job by reebok."
137497,1,"The quality and the outlook is good, but it's kind of longer at the tip of the shoes and make it loose when I walk."
78020,1,"This shoe horn is not your basic cheap plastic shoe horn. It is sturdy, and of great length and width. It looks like it wil stand up to the rigors of wedging feet in shoes."
232449,1,"The Angioline Liberty Flats are available in numerous colors for a reason. The comfort, fit, quality, and appearance can't be beaten. No matter what you wear, there's a color of shoes to match, and they always look nice. I have many people ask me where I buy my shoes, and I'm more than happy to tell them. I recommend The Shoe Mall, and Angioline shoes to anyone who'll listen."
196042,1,"having a 15 year history of Plantar Fascitis has limited the type of sandal that I can wear comfortably. Other than a pair of Oakley's that I've had for years, these sandals provide excellent support for my arch and I can wear them for most of the day. They are solid construction, have good traction and look great."
179316,1,"I've been wanting Converse high-top tennis shoes for years now, and my husband just recently purchased them for me for my birthday. I have weak ankles from years of hiking, past injuries, etc. The high top style gives my ankles more support. I only wish they had arch support and then I'd be in complete heaven. However, these are tops in my book, plus they look stylish! I love how they stay in style no matter what! Thanks!"
190770,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
254591,1,Really uncomfortable at first then stretched out and were rad. Nice mitigation between dress shoe and work boot for casual wear.
218810,1,"I enjoy them every time I wear them. Comfortable, sporty and hip enough so that my daughter's friends actually listen to me."
157326,1,"I was fitted for a pair of these at a speciality running store and purchased them with a gift card for over $100. I jog/walked a marathon in these a few months ago and they were great--no blisters, no nothing. I would definately purchase these shoes again, especially at the prices offered by Amazon!!!!"
60195,1,"My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
258767,1,I couldn't purchase these anyplace in town and as usual you had them available for me! I got them in record time and ready to send off for a christmas gift.
40439,0,"These flip flops are not the same as the Reef GINGER flip flops I bought a couple years ago and still use. There is not as much arch support as my old pair and they feel kind of like cheap styrofoam soles. I'm still going to wear them, but if you are buying these to replace an older pair... they are not the same. On the positive, they are true to size. I wear a size 8 and they fit."
65801,1,"I just love these sandals. I have 3 pairs now. They are absolutely the best in comfort and the odor detourant leather stays forever. I bought a pair last year and they still feel and smell great and I have gotten them wet many times and still in great shape. I just can't say enough good things about these slides and the comfort of Columbia shoes and sandals. The size runs perfect for me too.. my feet are on the narrow side and I was worried about them being too loose after wearing them for a while but they stay in shape great. Would highly recommend them for wear, comfort, and durability."
242898,1,I love theses shoes. I can wash them and they just look great. I also have a white pair. I wear them all the time.
149541,0,The insole in the shoe was installed improperly. It was easily repaired but still not up to quality control standards
328130,1,"I bought about these 5 months ago at the mall for a little under 40 bucks. These are one of the most confortable shoes I've had at a 4"" heel. As other reviews say, for people that are used to walking on high heels, it's a really confortable pair. Can't say they are tight in the tip; on the contrary, I think they're very roomy there, however my feet are somewhat skinny. After 3-4 times worn they molded to my feet shape and the material is a very good quality leather so I have to differ with the reviewer that said that is a tough material. The color I have (bronze) is pretty versatile and I can wear them for the office without looking too flashy, and wear them for cocktails, and as other user said, these look great with skinny jeans.I totally recommend it. I'm getting them in other colors as this is a great add to any closet."
319973,0,"The quality of the shoes seem fine. The color is ballet pink which is different from pastel pink so I found the color to be as I expected. However, the size is vastly different from street shoe size. I purchased them for my grand daughter who has a very narrow foot. I ordered size 3N which is 1/2 size larger than her street shoes she could not get her foot into the shoe. I ordered a second pair size 4 1/2N which fit perfectly. I did not have an option for exchange. I was unhappy with having to order another pair ship back the too small pair and wait for a credit to my credit card. Wish I had ordered from Zappos where shipping both ways is free and includes overnight shipping. Shoes cost only about $3.00 more at Zappos but would have been better in the long run."
367646,0,They are a basic tan mocassin. I bought them to wear while walking the dog. They are okay for that.
360593,1,I bought these for my daughter's spring musical. They fit great and she's been able to break them in during rehearsals. You definitely need to order a half-size larger than street shoes.
292354,1,These shoes were a gift for my daughter and she loves them. I was also impressed how quickly the order arrived. This was my first online purchase and would be comfortable in ordering again.
311086,1,"I bought these shoes for a figure competition. They are what I need, so they are good for that since they are clear, they won't bring attention to the shoes. My only comment is that they might run a tiny bit small. I bought my normal size, and they fit me just like the picture shoes. My heal and toes are at the very edges of the shoe. If you want them to have a little extra space, you might want to go a size larger. They don't come in half sizes, so I opted to keep what I got."
100580,1,"I love my new Birkenstock sandals. I have a very old pair and forgot how great a new pair feels. Received my order very promptly, and without any concerns. Would highly recommend a new pair and a beginning pair for anyone!"
262499,1,"Propet makes excellent shoes, all types, their sandals are my favorite and this style is the most comfortable I have every worn."
2598,1,"Great boot wear like sneakers but are tough and waterproof never had such a great pair of boots. I wear them daily and they never let me down,just a great product"
315531,1,"They are sized how a foot measurer should fit a shoe. Used to buy them 10 years ago, wish I could always afford them, loved everything about them except that they were shoes! As for quality of recently produced shoes, will soon find out!"
126918,1,i am very pleased with my product- it was a gift for my son who is an avid skate boarder and vans has b come 1 of his favorite shoes
243765,1,This item was a gift. It was received in time for Christmas 2011. received in great condition. The shoes are super comfortable and very stylish. Great buy! 2 thumbs up!
147631,0,"Being a female college student, I felt a necessity to own a pair or two of Uggs. Everybody wears them, but after my first winter in Michigan, I don't really understand why. Although they are super warm, they aren't waterproof (sucks for slushy days and wet snow), they don't have good traction (difficult to walk on snow and ice), and being made of sheepshin, they're difficult to clean. The salt put on the roads here damages them. I own the Ugg cleaning/care kit, and even that isn't enough to keep my Uggs looking good.I wouldn't recommend these for anyone who lives in a snowy place. Invest in some real snowboots."
130741,0,"I bought the shoes for my husband. He says, ""The shoes are not comfortable. I like the colors and they look good but they are not comfortable at all. I will probably never buy this type again."""
335884,1,Very comfortable - this croc is beneficial for problem feet. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family. Happy withproduct.
313253,1,"They are adorable. My son loves them. They are a bit narrow, so if your little one has wide feet, they may be tight."
174184,1,Brought these for my mother and she stated that these were the most comfortable pair of sandals she owns. I would recommend these as good buy as it is very difficult to find wide width shoes
50233,1,"These are excellent boots. I have worn them for years. Also, the seller, PapaShoe, is very nice to work with, and the people there are very friendly and helpful. I would recommend their store to buy shoes from to others."
270147,1,"This was a gift for my father on fathers day. He tells me they are very comfortable. So I guess according to him, these are very good sneakers."
345744,1,Sweeet!...my boy is flipping over these. He wants to wear them everywhere - I drew the line at church.
13506,1,Shipping was fast and free!!!! I was so amazed at how fast this got here! I Recieved my shoes 3 days after shipping... they are very comfortable and cute and go with anything... DEFINATELY a great find! =]
314358,1,"I just want to add that my baby girl looks amazing with this shoes!!, and also the price is great!!"
183113,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
85693,1,Excellent quality: received quickly: love the Crocs: perfect for around the house or beachcrocs Beach Clog
300536,1,No review necessary. They are wheat timbs. The quality n look of these boots from Timberland speak for themselves. :)
48035,1,"We have owned 6 pairs, they last about two years of hard wear, and they are great! Comfy, easy to clean and tolerate all kinds of outdoor conditions (except snow and ice)."
321874,1,"I've been doing ballet-style workout DVDs at home lately, and wanted a pair of ballet shoes to use for those workouts so that I'd have better grip and support. I can't speak to how well these work for ballet classes, but I thought that my review might help others like me who are buying these for the same reason.Based on some reviews, I ended up ordering these at first one size larger than what I usually wear in my street shoes. The 8.5 that I bought (instead of my usual 7.5) were huge, but (thanks, Amazon, for your great return policy), I returned these and ordered a 7.5, which fit perfectly.The ribbon at the front of the shoe can be pulled tight to adjust the width of them, and they are very comfortable. They don't have a split sole on the bottom; instead, the sole is one long piece that stretches down the length of the shoe.If you're looking for some at-home ballet-style workouts, I also recommend Mary Helen Bowers'Ballet Beautiful: Total Body WorkoutandBallet Beautiful: Body Blastand Leah Sarago's four workouts, especially her newest oneBallet Body Signature Series: Total Body. All of these are a lot of fun to do, and make me feel like a ballerina!"
286923,1,Every year for the past 4 years I bought a pair of the two strap American Eagle sandals. Each year I wear them out and need a new pair (30$). These are vastly more comfortable by the day since they form to my foot and I can get these repaired. $50 for these was a bargain.
256994,1,"Wonderful experience all the way through. The shoes are soooo comfortable and are dressy enough to wear with summer pants and shorts. As always, dealing with Amazon is the best: never any problem they can't solve. Have ordered these shoes in another color b/c I loved my first pair so much."
374200,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
191703,1,The shoes have cushion where needed which makes it a very comfortable shoe for walking. They are also very good when you have to be standing for a lenghth of time. I would recommend this shoe for people who have to be on their feet (working/standing) for a long period of time.
167438,0,"I really wanted to rate this shoe higher. The size was correct and fits well, the delivery was prompt. Although the shoe doesn't have a lot of support it is quite comfortable and has plenty of room. It's just that I ordered light blue and white and ... well...they are gray. Decidedly gray. The invoice is correct and the box is correct so unless a gray pair was substituted this is their idea of light blue. The gray is OK just not what I wanted and not my favorite color. I was intending to have a pair to be a cute match for faded blue jeans. I don't think I would order another pair on line since the description wasn't very helpful. If color is an issue it might be better to get these at a local store."
100065,1,Absolutely love these shoes. Wore them ALL day the first day I had them and they are so comfortable and cute.
117540,1,"A very nice, soft pair of ballet slippers. My granddaughter loves them. The price was also very nice. Very pleased.."
164,1,"was given a pair of these shoes used,worked in them in my shop welding/ machining/auto & truck repair for about 6 years. very comfortable & rugged. this is why i went online @ located another pair through amazon. so far this pair is exceeding my expectations. my thanks to AMAZON & HI-TEC: heavyhaull"
127455,1,"These shoes are very comfy once worn in, and perfect for anything from walking to skateboarding. I would choose them over converse any day. They are also quite durable."
173728,1,I received my Scout Sandal very quickly. It was in perfect shape and fit just like was supposed to.I am very pleased with the service and the product.
92084,1,I loved the shoe and the price. I thought the shoe was different than my normal style but loved it.
389122,2,"Image shows Purple HI TOPS, but when you order....you get LO tops. Also, items that say 'qualifies for super saver shipping!' they're not. So unless you are ok with lo tops when you want hi tops...don't fall for it!"
208835,1,"This bag is wonderful! I primarily use it as a pool bag (very roomy, with plenty of space for towels, magazines, snacks, and more). It cleans up easily, and the colorful patterns make it an eye-catching piece. It also makes the perfect summer ""luggage"" - it easily accomodated all of my needs for a week-long trip to the beach. It's very light-weight (unlike my ""boat tote"" bags) and very strong, so you can load it up with everything you need. I love this bag - I've already ordered three more as gifts for friends and family."
186681,1,This is my second pair of Propet women's W3902 tour walker velcro sneaker purchased from Amazon. My feet feel so much better after wearing them and the velcro makes it easier than tying because of my hip situation. I would recommend these highly and the price and free shipping is great on your budget.
110943,0,"I was happy that Keds offered a canvas slip-on shoe in wide widths and in the color that I wanted. When I purchased the shoes, I was looking for an inexpensive shoe to wear around the house rather than a shoe for serious walking. However, I quickly realized that the shoe did not provide the foot support that I needed. Also, because I have a high instep, that particular style was not suitable for me. Consequently, I would not recommend this style shoe for those with a high instep or for those who need strong arch support for walking even for short distances."
77382,1,"I can't even tell you how happy I am with my new crocs. The most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Not really the best looking, but definitely the most comfortable."
34772,2,"SanFran Jo says:I, too, noticed a difference in fit and also that the pair I recently purchased was made in China. I had to return my pair because they were not comfortable. I already have two other pair of Dansko Professional clogs, and they are very comfortable. I am disappointed in the comfort of the most recent pair I purchased. I have noticed that some of the clogs do say by Danita. Thanks to happy mommy mentioning Sanita, I googled Sanita clogs. Below is a statement found online from the Original Clogs website:For the last 17 years, all Dansko Professional clogs and all Dansko Stapled Clogs have been manufactured by Sanita in Europe. The relationship between Dansko and Sanita ended in August 2007. Since then, Sanita entered the US market and is now distributing their products directly. If you are looking for the Original stapled clogs with patent number 0060240 stamped on the bottom (made by Sanita exclusively), then look no further as our website features Sanita Clogs' products exclusively.I ordered the ""original"" clogs by Sanita and they fit as comfortably as the two other pair I have. The number mentioned above is stamped on the bottom."
154435,1,"They are comfortable and fashionable shoes, fit well with jeans and shorts.Besides having no pins are very easy to put them and remove them.The order in size 9 for my 3 years and are very good.Son unos zapatos comodos y a la moda, quedan bien con jeans y con shorts.Ademas por no tener pasadores son muy faciles de ponerlos y de sacarlos.Los ordene en talla 9 para mi hijo de 3 a&ntilde;os y le quedan muy bien."
381454,1,"I'd been beating up Dan Post boots for about 20 years, and they've served me well -- good cost/looks/durability ratios. But I was looking for something with a more solid heel (Dan Post's are often hollow to save on weight, which also makes them LOUDER on a tile floor). These boots from Double-H are more comfortable, stay looking good through the weather (just give them a good brushing every once in a while to clean, and choose a saddle soap/mink oil/etc. routine that you stick to consistently whenever the leather looks a little dry) and cost a few dollars less than I'd been paying for Dan Post. And Double-H will be my first choice when it's time to go shopping again."
253885,1,Simple great shoe. eS has been in the skate market for a long time but has yet to turn full hipster and still makes a quality skate shoe for those who need something durable and fashionable. I had my first pair of accels in 1999 and I can say that they have not changed a bit. They last forever and are very comfortable. I my self so not skate but I do a lot of walking/trail hiking and they are even good for that. I bought them originally for their durability but I keep buying them for their comfort and style.
170192,1,"Great products, mis-named in description (it was written pattern instead of patent, which prevented me from finding it for some time!). Comfortable, well-made, easy to wear with anything from jeans to a suit. Thumbs up from me."
233729,1,"These are my favorite flats, by far. They are so comfortable and work well both with work clothes and my favorite pair of jeans. When one pair eventually wears out, I just buy another.I'm very hard on shoes, but these tend to last better than other flats I've tried, and they're more comfortable."
215496,1,"RYKA shoes are simply the best. I am a very active aerobicsinstructor and hiker. No one makes better shoes than RYKA, period."
273507,1,These flip flops are super comfortabe! Great for all day walking - I'm always looking for comfortable sandals and flip flops since I live in Florida. These are great! I also love Naot sandals.
62301,1,Love them have been wearing Keds for yearsand they never let me down. My 10yr old daughter also loves hers.
132091,1,"Good boots for the money, only problem my husband had was the sides of the boots would rub on his legs, he is no longer wearing them because of that, could be just the way the boots fit his feet?"
254914,0,"I thought these were really cool. A great retro-cool look (made me want to drink Mai-Tais and listen to cool jazz) but the sizing was not right for my foot, so I returned them. I tried 2 sizes (I burned up the savings by having to pay return shipping to Amazon - some competing sites don't make you pay to return shoes......); the first my regular size which was too big, and then a half size smaller which was too small. As popular as these shoes are, my guess is that the problem is with my feet, not the shoes. It probably could have been helped if the shoes had an extra row of eyelets so the strings would go up just that much higher. But, I don't blame Clarks for not altering a classic."
18651,1,"Alright well i am a size fourteen and i usually wear 4e shoes they say its a D size shoe but to me it feel like a 4e because it fits me quite swell. any way i got the cool green ones it fits perfectly i mean the best shoes i ever got. the only problem with the green ones is that when ever you use them it attracts a lot of dirt. A lot! but all i do is spray Shout on them wait 5 minutes and then wipe it down with a damp cloth. but other than that they really have nice ankle protection, by the way there my first ankle tops i ever got and i am extremely glad i got them. i would and did recommend them to everyone. so get them the best 33 dollars i ever spent!"
108653,0,"I bought two pairs of Adidas cleats. This was one of the pairs.I purchased them thinking of the comfort they seemed to provide based on the photo. And yes, they're very comfortable, it's like wearing a regular sneaker, but alas, after 20 minutes of sprinting on the field my legs really began to burn, the weight these cleats have is at least twice that of a regular mid cleat.I'd rather wear some worn down pairs I have at home that these, the unnecessary added strain on my legs is just too much."
55820,1,"I've always wanted to wear Keds, and now I finally can! I have wide feet, so they have always been to tight width wise. I'm so glad I was able to find them in wide width. Love the low rise of the shoe, love the look. The only thing I would change is making the inside a bit softer, and maybe more support. But I still love them!"
50952,1,"As in most things, not just clothing, you generally get what you pay for. These oxfords are beautiful and well made. The look, quality and construction will bring a smile to any man's face. I bought both the Merlot and Black Oxfords, and also purchased the matching colors of the AE Basic Wide Dress Belt. Perfect business attire combo for any executive. Highly recommended."
235972,1,"Since 1908, Converse has maintained their reputation of being one of the number one shoe suppliers in America. Marked by their innovative style and authentic sports history, they have been recognized by the public for being, ""America's Original Sports Company.""Converse is noted for their most famous product the ""Chuck Taylor All-Stars,"" but this is not their ""sole"" focus. Amongst other creations, Converse has given birth to a new, sleek, stylish tennis shoe known as the Converse Targa.The Converse Targa fulfills both fashion and function. Its color variations and distinctive design compliment your style, while providing you with great cushion and support. This cushioning is provided by E.V.A. or Ethyl Vinyl Acetate located in the mid-sole, an essential part in most athletic shoes. Other assets of this material are its ability to aid in shock absorption, and retain its cushioning after bending or compression for a long period of time.I own several pairs of Converse tennis shoes including the Converse Targa, and I am completely satisfied with their durability, style and comfort.I recommend that you go out and purchase a pair of Converse Targa's. Despite their function and fashionable qualities the Targa's are reasonably priced, and for this low price you can ""Converse with the Stars."""
141868,0,"This has been a decent winter running shoe with plenty of stability, fair amount of cushion, and decent traction. My primary gripe has been the insert not staying in place and riding back in the shoe."
178659,1,Classic perfection. Fits amazing. Looks beautiful. Shipped quicker than expected. Long lasting. This is my third pair of this exact pair. Each has lasted years. Awesomesauce in a box.
355526,1,"I love ASICS...I've been using these twice a week for over 3 years now. They're still functional (i.e. no holes, loose sole, etc.)."
54631,1,"these are just like they have always been. comfy, good looking and long lasting."
35285,1,I'm just happy i chose this coz i love the shape & comfort is perfect.
208815,1,GREAT. STILL USING THEM. THEY KEEP THEIR SHAPE AND THE PRICE WAS RIGHT. WOULD BUY THEM AGAIN. KEEP THEM ON AMAZON.
100742,1,My daughter has not taken these off since she opened them Christmas day! These aren't just cute ballet slippers they are the real deal. They seemed small at first but the leather has stretched to fit her foot perfectly.
87755,1,"It's hard to find a white tennis shoe that doesn't just look plain stupid these days. I hate the huge basketball puffy shoes and the super white polo club/preppy versions. So when I saw this shoe I had to have it. It is the right combo of both retro styling and unassuming 'I don't care' fashion. The shoes are really comfortable, durable as heck and just keep getting better looking the more they are broken in. I'm going to buy another pair because after 1 year of abuse I know I'm going to need a backup when they eventually disintegrate.I recommend the white with Navy myself. The white with black are a little too 'Run DMC'...though they wore Adidas....I know."
121222,1,My husband is so pleased with these boots. He loves timberland and we were so lucky they had his size. Absolute great buy.
255709,1,Very nice tennis shoe for the price. Comes with an assortment of colored decals to attach to the side.
263326,1,"Quick shipping, and no problems at all. They have all the colors so you can mix and match"
8123,1,very nice looking boot but they run narrow. the length is good so going up to a larger size did not work for me.
200141,0,"Hi, we purchase clothing and shoes from all over the world and only the US is significantly different.The US sizes are much smaller and this was not obvious on this web site.Other retailers around the world advise which sizing range is used, including some via Amazon.Or, they clearly marked which country sizing they were using.It should be clear on the website which sizing the retailer is using.On the plus side, the shoes were delivered as ordered, on time and in good condition.RussellAustralia"
355989,1,Very happy with the product. It is what was expected and the service was excellent.
141532,1,"Just love these clogs!I oredered size 40 (European). I'm usually take a size 9 or 9.5 American. These shoes are a good fit, though just a little loose in front. A 39 would have been too small I think. Wearing socks helps.They are comfortable & well-cushioned, though not extremely so. If I was doing a whole lot of walking I'd probably choose another shoe.I do wear a lot of clogs and though I usually prefer them with some embellishements or a little fancier design, these are just great & I've been wearing them nearly every day. They are lightweight & look good.The green suede is really attractive & perfect for these fall days in the Pacific Northwest. I sprayed some leather protector /water repellent on them and am ready to face a wet autumn. (As a matter of fact I'll be wearing them to a tailgate at the Husky game this weekend.)"
280411,2,the item is not what it appears to be. be aware of fine print shipping costs.
177280,1,"I got mine from a Converse store in a mall near St Louis for $20. I've had them for 2 and a half years and have worn them everywhere. I ran a 10 minute Mile and a half in them twice for my Air Force PT Test. I've worn them in Iraq, Kuwait, Arizona, Florida, Washington. they are a part of me. Truly an epic shoe. They're also a great driving shoe, with a nice rolled heel after some wear, and great pedal feel. Would recommend them to anyone looking for a nice all around, everyday shoe."
262860,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
204789,1,I really like these tims. They are comfortable and stylish. My son likes them too. I do recommend buying them.
70655,1,WOW! I never thought a pair of shoes would make that much difference. I have been having problems walking for a couple years now due to a couple of operations that left one foot a bit deformed and no feeling in either foot. These shoes make it possible for me to maintain my balance better and walk almost normally.Also have had issues with hammer toes rubbing on the top of shoes....the leather linings prevent the rubbing.Wish they looked a little more stylish though...
99046,1,"These were a purchase for my 13 year old granddaughter. Although I have not physically seen them because they live in VA and I in MN, she tells me that they are just what she wanted. Pleased with the ease of this transaction and the speed in which they were shipped to her. Thank you."
52075,0,"I received this shoe and love it. However, the sizing is off. I wear a 7 1/2 medium ladies size. So in sandals I have always wore a size 8. This size 8 is more like a size 7. I would return the item, but will cost more than I want to pay. So I will give these to my daughter-in-law who wears a size 7 so hopefully she can wear it. I think she will love the style. I am debating if I will buy a size 9 in a different color. Otherwise, it is a very nice sandal."
260043,0,"My first opinion when they came in the mail today was that these boots are cheap. They look cheap and feel cheap. This is what I expected having only paid $32. They are not rigid like a work boot and are a very light ""tan"", (almost white). I play airsoft and they look good with my different sets of camo. They are roughly 8 inches tall and are actually pretty comfortable the first time I put them on. I didnt want an expensive boot because I'm only going to wear them once or twice a month so I hope they will hold up for that much. Conclusion: They look good with camo for all you airsofters/paintballers and they flimsy so it should be easy to run in them, but I do not believe they will hold up for moderate to heavy use such as work or hiking trips. Also they run a bit big. I wear a size 9.5 got a size 9 and they are still a little too big. Overall, they should work well for what I intend to do with them but not so much for anything outside of that. As we all know you get what you pay for."
138613,1,"I really like Adidas and I have probably bought 20 pairs or more for me and my family on Amazon. Amazon has great prices on these and when they are on sale, well that's unbeatable!"
311034,1,"This is my second pair. They are comfortable, and being able to wash them with water is a big plus. Buy them."
366315,1,"These Keens were literally life savers for me. After going down some Class 4's in a sit-on-top fishing kayak on the Cumberland River, I had to climb lots of rocks. If not for these shoes, the outcome may have been different.They do get gravel in them sometimes, but not that big of a deal. GREAT SHOES, WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!"
334659,1,Not many products as consistently good as Clark's Wallabee boots. For casual shoes they can look good in slacks as well.
344193,1,These are classic Converse shoes. They arrived quickly. The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform.
52557,1,Propet always makes a good walking shoe. These fit perfectly -- true to size and width.
380907,0,I recommend these boots to anyone who has large feet and so far been unhappy with the range of safety footwear on the market . I will definitely buy again and will tell others with awkward foot size to try these Nautilus boots.
4380,1,"Had these for a little over six months now. I've been hiking in the forest, rock hopping, walking all day in the city in these shoes. My feet have never hurt after wearing them all day."
348398,1,The order was on time and the way it was describe on the site. A+++++
73231,1,"This footwear is great for walking the treadmill. If I was buying training shoes I'd be paying about six to seven times the amount as I did for these. Now, normally I take a size 10/6x so new balance is about the only brand I can get with a fit. Well, I bought the crocs at $15 a pair because not too many peeps want a red xxlarge. I also have a high arch and walk on the outside of my foot. I needed to take a pocket knife to the inner side of the clog to make room for my width. The high arch and and wide foot is the reason I went with the xxlarge. Since I don't run on the treadmill (I walk briskly) these are most comfortable and ideal. The price was so low that I bought three pair. If I didn't need to modify them a bit with my knife I'd give them five stars for my needs."
367088,1,"I decided to try these sandals as a possible replacement for the old Clark's Sunbeat, which no longer lives up to its former standard of quality, unfortunately. These have a very similar appearance and, if anything, are more comfortable. I thought I might dislike the look of the Velcro straps, but it's actually not very noticeable. They are very comfortable and, I thought, more attractive than they appeared in the picture (of course, I'm at an age where ""comfortable"" tends to be synonymous with ""attractive""). I downgraded them one star because the ankle strap tends to ride a little high on me, rubbing right underneath my ankle bone. I think when they get broken in and soften up a little, this will probably cease to be a problem, but for now, it's very irritating after awhile. Overall, though, I like this sandal and look forward to wearing it this summer."
49689,0,"I'm normally a 6.5 shoe size, so I ordered a 7. My foot fit perfectly at the base, but then my calves (which at their widest are slightly smaller than 14""), didn't fit. The size 7 boots wouldn't zip up past them! They look great, but it's too bad they don't fit. I'm rating them 3 stars because this is the first time any boots have never fit over my calves."
171137,1,The order came quickly and I was very pleased with the shoes and also the price I paid for them.
368640,1,"I purchased these for my husband's birthday and they were an immediate hit. They were comfortable from the first wearing and now they're hard to get off his feet! Quick delivery, too."
371360,1,I have a very narrow foot. Hard and expensive to fit. VANELi is one of the few shoes that meet my needs. These flats are great - can dress up or down. Would like to have a pair in every color.
228017,1,"i said the always fauthful converse 'cause its simply the best shoe i ever had, they gimme all the confort that i need to walk very much!!!! i mean walk A LOT!!!!"
165247,1,Christmas gift for family member. She was so excited and loved getting these on Christmas day. We almost ended up keeping them for my wife.
33277,0,"After reading multiple reviews that the wide is really not wide enough, I figured I would order a wide. I generally do not have a problem with regular shoes, although some feel slightly too narrow. I measured my foot which seemed to be between an M and a C/D, so I went with the wide since apparently it was not wide enough for most people. Unfortunately, the shoe is wayy to wide for me. I am generally between an 8 and an 8.5 and I went with the 8, which fits fine length wise.I got the wheatfield leather. I am a student and I walk at least a mile a day and live a generally active life, and I needed real shoes for my weak feet and ankles! I was hoping to wear them day-today and mostly at my restaurant, which has no dress code. I have been wearing slip on vans with 0 arch support. At the end of each 7-8 hour shift, my feet and legs ache and after I sit for a while after a shift, I end up hobbling around until my feet readjust to walking. These shoes seem like they'll help with much better support. I was hoping they would look even better than they do, but they look more like old lady shoes than I anticipated (I am 22, so perhaps I define old lady differently!). The top of the shoe ends pretty far down my foot, which means if I wear skinny jeans my socks will definitely show. I suppose this means I should start wearing matching socks.But I still think its worth it to return them for an M."
170119,1,"i was soo happy to find my shoes in the style, color and size i wanted. I looked everywhere and this was the ONLY store that had them.Thanks again!!!"
89243,1,Bought these for my wife...she loves them...very well made! Fits true to size. Very pleased with on time delivery too!
318878,1,These shoes feel so great. They are true to size. Great for all around use.
35246,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
129401,1,These are amazing and my 10 th pair. The color is like a light champagne and go with everything. I loooove them. The run small so get a size bigger

204979,1,"Got this for my basketball playing son's shoes which were soaked after practice or game. They really dry them out within the timer of 2 hours on the dryer. Only problem is the shoes stink so bad, that when you put them on the dryer it circulates the stink into the air. We keep the dryer in the garage, not house! At over $100 for shoes, and getting the dryer after the season start, we are keeping the shoes. Would expect that putting new shoes on this from the get go would prevent the stink....will see. Either way, definitely worth it from the drying standpoint!!!"
102568,1,"estos son los mejores zapatos que he comprado y les he sacado la chicha, super comodo y duraderos a parte de ser muy casuales y pavos al andar"
184281,1,I had been looking for a pair of moccasin's for awhile. I wear a size 11 so finding shoes of any kind in stores is a bit of a challenge. I saw these on Amazon and was hesitant to order shoes without trying them on first but I went ahead and ordered.Later that week I received them and they actually fit! I wore them the first time for hours and there wa no breaking in period at all. Very comfortable. I do wear thin socks as I found they were a little too snug with my usual white sport type socks.

142504,0,"They have really big bumps and lots of them inside. Then the raised part under the toes is not too comfortable for someone with uncommon foot shapes. They are probably really good once you get used to them. I just looked inside the worn-out pair I have. They are smoother. I think they vary in the interiors quite a bit. I bought a pair of these, but returned them due to them being too bumpy. Mine are so old now, I don't know what they were like new."
359356,1,I had a foot surgery so walking typically hurts. These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. It is like walking on marshmallows all day long
342225,2,"I bought this shoes because, of the good reviews. I wanted something light, comfortable, waterproof and keep my feet warm. It's comfortable and light but there is absolutely no protection for your feet. I was soooo disappointed, my feet was very, very cold and it felt like I have no shoes at all even though I was wearing very thick socks. I guess for what I paid for should not expected too much!"
384532,1,"The first time I saw this shoe (in black/white patent leather) was on the feet of Boston Celtics All-Star forward Antoine Walker. Being a fan of ""old-school"" shoes and Mr. Walker, I immediately took a liking to the Adidas Promodel 2G.The Adidas Promodel line has been around for over four decades now and many a current and former NBA player has spent time in a pair, whether in high school, college or at the pro level. The first thing that stood out to me was how Adidas kept the classic ""shell toe"" as part of the shoe while adding minor adjustments to give it a nice blend of modern/retro looks. The patent leather also gives it a nice touch making the shoe simple, but unique.Another huge plus which I'm sure everyone will notice is the price. ... it ain't gonna clean out too many pockets and for this price y'all can go out and cop a pair or two (one for home games, one for the road). So, the bottom line on the Adidas Promodel 2G is that it's worth considering if you're a junior high or high school-level team looking for a good value in a team shoe (... the Promodel costs a lot less than most shoes designed for team use) or if you need a shoe for those lazy Sunday afternoon games down at the park."
4575,1,"I know this isn't the most helpful review but I would justlike to concur with the other reviews. I have had these bootsfor a year now and except for a few scuffs, they still are ingreat condition."
34679,1,"I got these for my 93 year old mother who still walks for exercise. She has an extremely hard to find shoe size (8 AAAA) and this is almost the only shoe made in that size any more so we are lucky to be able to buy it for her. She has these in several colors and finds them comfortable to wear every day, all day."
126523,1,They feel comfortable and true to size. The black and white go with everything. I'll be buying this same pair again.
125639,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
271724,1,"I am a nurse for critical care transport and needed steel-toed boots. When I was a volunteer with a busy EMS agency I had tried two other brands of steel-toe boots that were very uncomfortable, I'd come to believe it was just the price you pay for protected toes. When I tried these on I felt like I could jump up or down or run. They don't rub on my ankles or at the toes. I'm wearing them now and I'm not at work! They feel as comfortable as running shoes. We were out in the freezing rain/ice last night and they gripped the pavement well. The stretcher fell on my toe and it didn't hurt. I feel like I am better able to do my job, and my feet are much happier, in these boots! The online downside-the side zipper does not open very wide, I still have to unlace the boot to take them off. But overall I am extremely happy and would make this purchase again."
105250,0,"Good fit and great for softball if you don't like wearing full cleats. Very light and comfortable, except for the staple that protruded on the inside. Easily removed though, but a design flaw none the less."
345199,1,I find it hard to get chuck taylors in size 12 in stores around my area. It was nice to see they had them here on amazon in a mulitple of styles at great prices. The shipping was faster than I could of imagined and I plan to order future products from this provider.
76423,1,These shoes are great - comfortable and durable - exacly what I was looking for! I have worn them for multiple performances and they still look great!
254866,1,"Truly amazing shoes!I've being wanting this shoes for so long. I finally commit to buy them and the result as greater than expected.Excellent quality! Amazing fit!The shoelaces are a little low for my taste, but that is how the shoes are."
212262,1,"I love these shoes! I have bought several pairs in different colors. They are as comfortable as atheltic shoes but much more stylish. But beware--they run small! I normally wear a size 6.5, but I have to order a size 7 with these."
197735,1,"El producto fue entregado en el tiempo establecido, Producto original, Departamento 100% garantizado, los converse chuck taylor negros son los clasicos y por ser as&iacute; son los mejores"
306505,1,"I bought these boots for my neice's 4th birthday, she put them on right after opening them! I also bought her a pink cowgirl hat (from Cracker Barrel) and a book from Amazon, Cowgirl Megan (that's her name too!)She loves to play dress-up and I love to buy gifts that ""spur"" imagination! A book as a tie-in makes it that much better!I encourage anyone to buy a pair of these cowgirl boots for the litte girls in their lives!"
276245,1,"I puchased a pair of these for a 16 mile hiking trip. out of the box, no joke, these were(are) the most comfortable pieces of footwear i have ever had on my feet. as for the water proof part, i have found these boots are superior! during my hike it rained overnight and the next morning hiking through mud and rain my feet stayed completely dry. i also purchased another pair of these for work and daily wear because they are so comfortable, and part of my job as an auto-body technician is detailing a car after it is painted for customer pick-up. the drain in the shop at work is very poor, and during washing a car, u find yourself standing in a 2 inch puddle of water and my feet stay dry all day in these boots.i would also like to add that your feet stay warm in these boots. i usually wear normal socks, but when i go hiking or camping i wear warm thick socks. either way your feet stay warm"
34093,1,Easy Spirit shoes of all types are unquestionably the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I recently bought 5 different types of shoes and they are all fantastic. I have medical issues that make it difficult for me to wear shoes of any kind. Easy Spirit allows me to walk like I haven't for several years. Quality and comfort are fantastic.
182787,1,I have owned a pair of these shoes for over 3 years now and am currently going to buy the exact same pair again. I am a nurse and spend hours on my feet and these are the most comfortable shoes I've found. They've held up great! You'll love them too!
354260,1,"My father-in-law loves his new boot slippers, I don't think he's hardly had them off since Christmas, he say's they are the warmest and most comfortable boot slipper he has ever had. Thank-you for such a wonderful item."
285127,1,"No breakin period, stood in a stream for 5 minues and was bone dry, did a 10 mile hike - no hotspots.I love them... nothing bad to say, good grip, nice support, all I did is replace the liner with a gel footbed...but I do that with all my boots, the ones that came with were fine.LOVE THIS BOOT - way cheaper than most."
240532,1,I'm very happy with this purchase. I love my new navy Keds! They came quickly and fit great!
29323,1,"Not having worn this shoe for any length of time, I can only surmise that it will be as comfy as it feels now. My only disappointment was, once I received the shoe, the squared-off toe is broader than it appears in the online photos. That's the problem with buying online -- there's nothing quite like having an item in hand.Also, I'm glad I read the online reviews from prior customers. As a consequence, I bought a size smaller than normal and even that feels a little loose. Being a loafer, I hope I don't have problems with it slipping on my heel."
175034,1,"Very comfortable. Matches many colors. When your feet are happy, you are happy. At least I am."
364735,1,"Bought the book as a gift and the receiver loved it. The item came quickly and as described, great deal."
325366,1,Got theses for My wife for a modeling job she had.... She has tons of shoes that kill her feet and after shooting in for a few hours her feet were still feeling good.... She is normally a 5.5 and She got a size 6 and they fit her just slightly loose. Shipping was fast and as expected
292973,1,"First of all, I love the boots. My only problem is that I wear a men's US 10M. The boots fit like a 9 1/2. I like them enough I gave the 10s away and ordered 11s. If you are unsure, try on some DMs at a shoe store before you order. I am in Afghanistan, so no stores here. If they had fit properly, I would give them 5 stars."
39805,1,"I have been wearing this particular style of Reef flip flops for over a decade now. I strayed away foolishly for one summer when someone talked me into buying Rainbows and they fell apart in just a couple of months. When I lived in Florida these babies would last me for a full summer and up until the beginning of the next one when I would simply buy another pair. Now that I live in New York where there's more than 2 seasons, I can get about 2 summers out of them. I should have taken pictures of the pair that this order replaced. I had worn the tread off the bottoms and almost completely worn through the sole, but even then they were super comfortable. Although their sturdiness is amazing, what I love most about these flip flops are their ability to mold themselves to your feet in such a way that after a month or so of wearing them sometimes you forget you have shoes on (minus the fact that you're not stepping on glass or hot cement). Some people default to heels or sneakers as much as possible, I default to these flip flops as much as I can."
118536,1,"I don't know why they are called Rollers, given that these shoes have no wheels. However, they are a great pair of clogs! While they have a thick sole to give me a little more height, they are very stable. I might not wear these shoes for an extensive day of walking, but they are great for the office with khakis. All around, a great comfy shoe!"
226773,0,i got these shoes back in like early January and all ready the side is coming apart there is a open on the side. but there good shoes.
177734,1,"This is the first pair of Merrell's I ever bought and I ordered these based on a YouTube review.Update:These boots are outstanding in terms of ankle support,sizing. The tread is Vibram and they are the best. The sole,heel mid-sole are very supportive even in unstable areas. I put them to good use hiking and camping. The easy lace system made taking these on and off easy. Plus I feel like I can walk faster with these boots,probably that is because of the ultra stable foot bed of the shoe. This is the first Merrell boots I even owned and I am impressed. But I found them slippery when walking on wet porches made from wood. Also these boots were not waterproof above the fabric just below the first eyelets. Other than that definitly best boots for a hiker, great tread the sole has the shank I feel absorbs the rocks and roots that hurt feet after doing some miles on a trail."
52595,1,"I've used a lot of different brands of walking shoes and different models within brands and the Propet Stability Walker is head and shoulders above the rest. I walk 5 miles a day every day and need a good shoe. They are more comfortable right out of the box, they provide excellent support, and hold up under heavy use. I have used them for years and they have kept me pain free from plantar fascitis."
49154,0,"See the nice shine in the photo...well, you're not going to get that. You're going to get a &#34;matte&#34; finish on the leather portion. I bought these to spit shine for my VFW work...not going to happen I'm afraid.Comfort: just OKQuality: one of the aluminum eyelits is already dislodged.Will I sent them back...no ...too much hassle; besides, they didn't cost much"
285589,1,These shoes look nice and are extremely easy on the feet. I shot a wedding wearing them and never had an uncomfortable moment.
54140,1,Purchased these for my 75 year old sister who had been looking and looking for some navy keds. She loves them.
116949,1,"They are a very comfortable shoe and they last a long time. I bought my first pair of these shoes many years ago, and I just replaced them with another pair of the exact color and style, that is how much I love them."
278558,1,I bought these for my son. He had a pair he used for work (construction) and he wanted another pair that looked a bit nicer. He loves these and says they are very comfortable.
192327,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
25442,1,I love the style of this boot so much~~ Everything is perfect expect its weight. Next time I think I will buy a less heavier danner boot.
155263,1,The product is very good. I am satisfied with the quality. So far I have not had problems since I'm using. We recommend
161106,1,"Chuck Taylors are just my style!! They look good with anything i wear, and are very comfortable. All you need are some black jeans with a white or black shirt and your good to go!!! My only problem is that people just can't seem to watch where they are going, so if I pat dirt out of it, it looks like the color fade's in that area. But overall great shoe to wear!!! Watch your feet though."
226297,1,I am very satisfied with my recent Amazon purchase. My All Stars came significantly earlier than the prospected delivery date! I am extremely satisfied with the seller! Thank you Amazon!
112292,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
284832,0,"They worked great for tap dancing in a school play. Great price for shoes that were only used a month. The only problem was in sizing, we had to order a size and a half smaller than street shoes although it was recommended to order two sizes smaller."
272439,1,"I would suggest to everyone to visit the Teva website and sign up for their emails, because often you can get a good deal on their shoes. That said, I used to buy $2.50 Old Navy flip flops, and thus thought my mother-in-law had lost her ever-loving mind when she purchased Tevas for me. Now I LOVE TEVAS!! This style in particular is wonderfully supportive and conforms to the shape of your foot. They clean easily-- they can be thrown in the washer-- look nice enough for business casual wear, and feel amazing. Regarding the size issue, I have a fairly wide foot, as does my husband, and we haven't had a problem with fit. (Common sense should dictate that if you are a half size, you need to purchase the next larger size, not smaller.) Do not hesitate to spend the money on this shoe. Your feet will thank you."
196872,1,"I usually can fit into a 5.5M in clarks comfortably, though my feet are on the wider side and the back of my feet are higher than average. I ordered 5M blue for lack of half sizes and after reading some reviews stating them run big. I have yet to try them in the slushy boston street, and I just tried them on walking in my living room. The zippers make putting on and taking off the ice muchers very easy, much better than my snow boots with laces. About fitting, these shoes do run a bit longer, but not wider. There is still room ahead of my big toes, but it is quite snug around the ball of my feet. At the end of a day, I feel more comfortable let the shoes unzipped with thick socks on, but that might be just the high back of my feet (which is not high arch). May update after trying them in snowy/slushy weather."
29535,1,"I have worn these shoes for the past 5 years, and never once have I been disappointed with the quality. I have owned at least 10 pair, and the only reason I end up buying new a pair is because they just get dirty. I even wash them repeatedly (which should shorten the life of the shoe, but does not) and they still look good. You just can't beat this shoe when it comes to wearing it casually, it matches everything, and is very comfortable. As long as they make these, I will continue to buy them."
385782,1,"This shoe has been the best! My foot is very narrow and it fits me fine, my heel feels very secure. Also the roominess in the toes is great because I have a bone spur problem in my toe and most shoes really hurt it. I am very excited to have found these."
311338,1,"very satisfied with the way this shoe looks and feels. got lots of compliments on this shoe,"
272937,1,"This is the third pair of Five Ten Spire shoes that I have owned. They are great for long days on multi-pitch climbs. The leather upper forms to my feet and gives just enough to make a great all day shoe. The four star rating is because they seem to wear a little faster than my other shoes. If you are looking for comfort and performance for an entry level price, this is one shoe to try."
295767,1,"This isn't a review but just a message on the off chance that anyone representing Corcoran reads it.I live in the UK and it is virtually impossible to get these boots online in Europe. The ones I've finally managed to find cost an absolute fortune (185) which I'm still going to pay as I may not get another chance to buy any -since these ones will no doubt quickly sell out.There must be a huge potential market in the UK and Europe just from armed forces personel alone, such is the reputation of Corcoran over here. So for what it's worth, please for the love of god try and make Corcoran boots available on Amazon to the European market -I beg you!Regards, Liam."
120606,1,This is my third pair of this sandal. They are so comfortable. They take me everywhere. The leather is of great quality. You can get them wet and they dry just as soft as they were before they got wet. This is one of few pairs of footwear that I literally wear out. They provide good walking support as soon as you put them on. No breaking in needed.
213019,1,6 N is a hard to find shoe size. This white sandal was perfect in every way. It's exactly what I was looking for !!
63409,1,i was extremely happy with this purchase. these boots normally retail for around a $100 and Amazon beat that price. the boots are my favorite footwear. Amazon was accurate in description and I received them sooner than the expected delivery date. love Amazon!
356386,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
148108,1,This wedge heel is so comfortable. I can wear it to work all day without a problem. The green patent leather is so pretty and easy to clean. I highly recommended it.
331671,1,They are comfortable and perfect to wear as slippers around the house or outside. They arrived 4 days earlier than expected!
92204,0,"The style of this shoe is exactly what I was looking for. However, the size I ordered was too small and unfortunately it was not available in the size needed, so I had to return it and couldn't get another. Otherwise, I definitely would have kept it."
306965,2,"These shoes feel great, fit great too. The worst part about them is they squeak, and squeak loud. I cannot sneak out of the office or around employees because they are so loud and everyone knows I am coming."
234687,1,"These shoes lived up to my hopes after seeing the pictures on Amazon. The leather could be a little higher quality, it does have a slightly fake quality to it. I would pay a lot more for shoes that had this exact styling, but upgraded leather. All in all, they are a good value and look excellent. I've only worn them 15 times or so, but they still look great and are very comfortable."
50483,1,"I ordered these boots two days before Halloween and when I got them I was really happy with them! Great, sexy, and fun boots!"
4563,1,"I know this isn't the most helpful review but I would justlike to concur with the other reviews. I have had these bootsfor a year now and except for a few scuffs, they still are ingreat condition."
296706,1,"Since I bought the boot model of these shoes, I was so pleased that I wanted to get another pair. One day, just browsing amazon, I found these incredible fun shoes.Now I have them all!!!"
114179,1,"I bought these for my daughter's first ballet class. They are cute, easy to put on, durable, true to size, and shipped quickly."
346878,0,"kinda nice, but common coloured. Did,nt have the colour that I wanted in my size. Chocolate, sorta rare in this city. Many folks r with classic red that,s cool, though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best. Maybe i'll add another sumthin, shoe strings with prints........."
388359,1,I have 2 pairs of this model shoe and love them. After being a Nike fan for years I decided to give something else a try. This shoe is lightweight and very comfortable. I also love the classic style. And you can't complain about the nice price.
255215,1,i purchased these in different sizes. i got them on time and theyre perfect for my babies and i also got a great deal on them
323953,1,These shoe trees make a big difference... they help keep my dress shoes in good form and kept them from developing a horrible smell from moisture left in them. These are built very well and will last for years. It is an affordable investment to keep your dress shoes looking/smelling great.
217288,1,"I'll just echo the other 5 star reviews here. Everything they've said is true. These shoes are incredibly comfortable, and they look great! First day I wore them to the office I got a ton of compliments. I look forward to buying another pair of allen edmonds very soon."
153350,1,"These are absolutely the most comfortable and lightweight shoes I have ever worn. I have these in several colors, and will continue to buy them. The only thing that I would change is to make the white on the soles the same color as the rest of the shoe, but the only time that has prevented me from buying the shoe is when looking for black shoes to wear as part of a uniform."
247828,1,"Estoy encantada con esas sandalias, preciosas, muy comodas. He tenido otras sandalias de esta marca y me han resultado excelentes. Si lo recomendaria."
10577,1,"They are as Comfortable as can be. Wear them everyday, and they looks fantastic. Looking to get another pair in a different color."
4139,1,"These are my busbands favortie hike boot and work boot. The hold up well for about a year, if i switch between these & another pair. Great 8hr day boot, especially those like me who do landscaping,street work etc. Great overall fit, his feet have bunions,water proof is excel.,great support,Amazon has had the lowest price anywhere. Great for lite/mod. hikes. Hiked at the Pinnacles, Hollister, CA up the Condor trail. The grade/incline is steep, gravely, dirt, and slippery these boots held up!!!!!!!!!!didnt see one Condor, but it was a nice workout and his feet were comfy, cool and no pain. Right out of the box, comfort!!!"
372863,1,I was so happy with this purchase. I purchased this just days before Christmas. These came on time and were exactly what I wanted. Thanks for the great service.
219545,1,"I've been looking for red chucks for a while now. I love these!! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though, they run quite large."
267679,1,"I first purchased a pair of Hi-Tech Altitude boots approximately 10 years ago. They fit me extremely well and were very comfortable from the first moment I wore them. Prior to this purchase, I have had 2 different pairs of the Hi-Tech Altitude boots and I have not been disappointed. They wear extremely well and seem to last me about 4 or 5 years. I have found them excellent for everyday wear as well as for use in fishing and hunting. I think these are excellent low cut boots for such a moderate price. Haven't ventured into buying the $100+ boots, but then why should I when these work so well, so can not comment or compare my $70 Hi-Techs to the more pricey boots. I think you will be pleased with these boots."
244000,1,"My sons loves his Tevas, and wears them all the time, now that we finally have some decent days in Seattle.They stay on his feet because of the two adjustable straps. Great shoe for summer."
307195,1,"Great shoes, but if you are looking at these you already know that. I bought an off color because they were the cheapest here on Amazon, but they were the best color anyways. go figure. So shop around here, amazing the small differences in prices.I have a wide foot and they fit me fine, seem to be true in size."
316009,0,"This is the 5th pair of these shoes I've purchased. I buy at least 2 pairs a year. They're comfortable and I like the way they look. However the last 2 pairs have had problems with the stitching coming undone very soon after purchase. I still like them, but I'm definitely looking for a new boat shoe."
42369,1,These shoes are comfortable as well as long lasting. They do not make your feet sweat or smell bad like other high top shoes. This shoe never goes op of style
34840,1,"If you spend all day on your feet, and sneakers don't cut it, these are the shoes for you. This is my third pair. They hold up insanely well (I work in kitchens and wore my first pair almost every day for about three years). It's also possible to have them resoled and re-uppered, I believe, but I eventually tore out the staples at the toes and wore down the tread, so it didn't seem worth it. They are pricey, but I think they're worth every penny. My knees don't hurt at the end of they day like they do when I wear sneakers.The leather will look niced for longer if you polish them. I think dansko makes a specific polish, but I just use a regular brown leather shoe polish and a rag and haven't had any problems.I also have a &#34;dress&#34; pair which I wear when I'm not at work. That's how much I like them."
193859,0,"Absolutely love this style of shoe and this is my third pair. They did a quality change for SURE. I can barely slide my foot in it's so stiff. The sole seems to be a hard plastic feel instead of the soft kind before. And the shoe ""leather"" is stiff and looks cheaper. It is still comfortable to wear, once I can cram my foot in (practically needs a shoe horn). I hope I don't have the sole cracking problems others mention here. It's a shame, this used to be a 5 star shoe."
365049,1,I was so happy with this purchase. I purchased this just days before Christmas. These came on time and were exactly what I wanted. Thanks for the great service.
168807,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
284057,1,"These are great sandals! I bought some last summer and haven't been able to locate them locally, but fortunately they were available on the Internet. Love them! One of the most comfortable sandals I have found."
281028,1,"These are great run around shoes and camping. Light weight so you'renot logged down on short hikes. Don.t show dirt and i,ve washd them in the past. I wear 8.5 N andthese shoes fit pefectly. Nice navy lighter than shown but not toolight. Avazoncame through again for me. Jakjaneus"
191742,2,"I purchased two pairs of these based on the Naturalizer ""Scout"" pair which I already own and love. I have had them for well over five years and they are fantastic. I was so excited to see this style for sale on Amazon.com.However, after receiving them, they are NOT the Naturalizer Scout. They are a cheap knock-off and definitely not worth the money. The REAL Scout shoe is a leather upper, padded sole, and has elastic in the back strap to help adjust the shoe.What I received is plastic! Plastic is never comfortable on your feet when you are used to leather. The sole is not padded and sinks in. The back strap does not have the elastic which helps to adjust it.I am so disappointed and I would never recommend these to anyone"
348180,1,"Very happy with my purchase. Because of my small feet, I have trouble finding proper fitting shoes. These shoes were very comfortable and a perfit fit. I didn't even need to break them in."
255410,1,"I saw these moccasins in a store in San Juan Capistrano CA but by the time I went back to get them, they did not have my size anymore, so I found them on Amazon.com. Lucky me! They are so soft, and comfortable. I like the color because it is neutral and I can wear them with anything and they will be good in warm weather."
331469,1,"Love the Croc. Best thing yet for vacation air travel in the US, starting with the pre-boarding search and continuing through the flight. Comfortable, stable, and easy to slip on and off. Beats the heck out of the socks the airlines used to give out on the long flights (remember those?)"
140208,1,This is a great fitting shoe if you put a double air foam insoles in them. I now owe 6 pair in different colors.
26353,1,"Aside from the old-school good looks, comfort, support, and style of the New Balance 991s, these are the unofficial shoes for prep school students and fraternity members. Wear them with khakis, a polo shirt, and a baseball hat (preferably of a large Southern state school - UNC or UVA is ideal).They are also ideal for use with contrasting laces - thick red ones are best."
44275,1,"I am an intermediate runner I would say. I run various 5K and 10K's, Half marathons and have started to dabble into the world of trail and adventure racing. I say that to let you know I am no professional but I do love to run and compete against myself. For the Kansas City half marathon this past year I wanted to try a minimalist shoe to see if my times would change any from my times I produced in Nike Vomero's and Mizuno Wave's. I tried multiple pairs of this type of shoe on and unfortunately for me (due to the color scheme) these felt the best.I was amazed at how comfortable they felt because by looking at them you would think it would feel like an old High School CC waffle, not the case. The only running I did on these prior to raceday was about 5 miles at an easy pace on a treadmill to get the feel of the shoe. Raceday comes and yes I get alot of looks but I eventually get over that. The first couple of miles were interesting and I thought I had made a mistake. However, once I got into my stride these performed greatly. I was able to maintain splits at personal record times with no thoughts about foot and leg pain. By the end of the race I had knocked off 5 minutes from my previous times, I will let you decide whether it was the shoe or training. My legs felt great as did my feet. I did have one little ""hot spot"" on one of my toes but that should be expected.I tried these just to see what it would be like to race in a minimalist shoe and I can now say I will never race in a trainer again. I swear by these shoes for racing and speedwork. Get over the color scheme and enjoy this pair of shoes. Oh yeah the ""ecco friendly"" piece doesn't hurt either."
160335,1,"These shoes,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Hi Top are the ones that I've looked for all my life.They are extremely comfortable, well made, fit just right, keep you warm in cold weather and cool in the summer. I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Please, follow the advice stated in the link regarding women's and men's zises.This is very important.Don't get confused with other brands or models. I wish they'd come in different colors, I'd get one of each."
204038,1,"these shoes are SOOOOOOOOOOOO comfortable. usually when a shoe is flat is has no inside cushion, however that is not the case with these shoes. furthermore the style is SO hot, people ask me all the time where i got these shoes! they look great with jeans. good for walking around town, even going out!"
277784,1,"My work takes me out in bad weather frequently, and I really need a boot that will keep my feet dry. I have suffered through 3 different pairs of ""waterproof"" boots that gave me no protection--you get what you pay for, I guess. Someone suggested I order from L. L. Bean, and I was getting ready to fork up the dough, when I saw these in an e-mail from Amazon. They are not fancy, but they ARE waterproof! And, after an initial breaking-in period, they are quite comfortable. I am thoroughly satisfied with these boots."
287021,0,"I mistakenly ordered the wrong width, have reordered it but havn't recieved it yet, I hope it fits as it is a nice well made thong."
133419,1,"These shoes were a birthday present for my 4yo. Based on reviews, I decided to buy one shoe size up from her current shoe size to be safe. She went up a size right before her birthday and they fit perfect. They match street shoe size as recommended. Great shoes at a great price!"
268528,1,"I'm semi-handicapped and needed a slide-on slipper for cold days and nights and these slippers were perfect. Easy to slip on, keep me warm but don't make my feet sweat! I was hesitant to pay so much for slippers but they were well worth it!"
221732,1,"Oh my gosh...this is the best shoe ever!If you have a problem with WIDE feet (mine are boats! High instep and just plain wide!), these are a wonderful shoe. I have such trouble finding comfy stuff to put on my feet. These are actually ""walkers"", so they are good for all the basic stuff. They are also SUPER LIGHT! They just feel like clouds on my feet. I am in heaven.Also, the styling on your feet is very slimming. Some shoes LOOK like boats on. These have small cording to tie up with and the shape is very narrow looking across the top. But very roomy inside.Wide shoe that has a narrow appearance. PRICELESS!They look like an athletic shoe, not geriatric like some walkers do (not that there is anything wrong with that ). Roomy... but I feel very secure in them when walking. Not wobbly at all.If you have trouble getting shoes, I feel your pain!!! and I highly recommend these."
89589,1,Another GREAT shoe from Stride Rite!LOVE these! My son likes them also.True to size and width.
48575,0,I really love the look of these sandals and hope that one day they will be comfortable. The straps rub the top of my feet and have caused blisters so I am trying to figure out a way to loosen up the straps. I have never had a sandal do this before. To walk on these shoes is very cushion like.
1653,1,"Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
168053,1,"I work in a supermarket, with concrete floors covered by linoleum (as with most stores) so I needed a shoe that was sturdy with good support and yet, gentle on my feet. This shoe works great. I've worn this pair for about 6 weeks and am very happy with them. I ordered my regular size but in wide and that helps tremendously. I would buy these again."
194296,1,"[[ASIN:B0002LTGE8 Naturalizer Scout]]As difficult as it is to obtain a Narrow size, I was able to purchase this beautifully crafted shoe at a very reasonable price. Thank You."
12014,1,I love my chuck Taylors. They go well with Jeans or almost anything that I want to wear. Looking to buy the Chocolate next.
109167,1,"I bought these shoes as a beater pair to only use while playing basketball outdoors. I have been pleasantly surprised at the good cushioning, comfortable fit, and great traction these shoes provide. I now use these shoes as my primary basketball shoes for indoor or out. I've had the shoes for a few months now and they have proven to be very durable as well. My only complaint is that if you get one of the glossy colors, it scuffs easily - but it's only cosmetic."
34555,1,"I have had over 10 pairs of easy spirit shoes and have these in two colours. I have high insteps, high arches and hammertoes... and these are still comfortable. The support is not as good as in their running and training shoes, yet plenty good for walking long distances and taking public transport daily."
19392,1,I have a difficult time finding shoes that will work for me. Most stores do not carry fashionable women's shoes in wide widths. I am enjoying this pair of Easy Spirit Shoes in the color red. I would purchase these again without hesitation.
174657,1,"I purchased the Naturalizer shoe, Scout, Since I already have bought 4 or 5 pr Naturalizer shoes through Amazon, I knew the quality of the shoe, and what service to expect and I have not bee disappointed. Easily, a 5-star experience!"
5436,1,"I bought this pair from a plus-size catalog, and have been extremely pleased with them. My flat feet are clown-sized and wide, and I'm partly disabled (one foot is usually swollen), so you can imagine how difficult it is to find comfy shoes. This brand and model is very lightweight and cushioned as I walk. The light weight is important because I don't have to stomp around in boots, and I don't trip on carpet or other surface disruptions. I can put on some mileage with this pair! The Velcro straps easily adjust for my normal foot and swollen foot. It's all good. Time to buy another color, because the first pair, bought in 2008, is by no means worn out or broken. Add to my cart, Amazon!"
32798,1,These boots are as cute as can be! Got them for my 10 yo daughter and she loves them. The stitching is nicely done and the silver toe tip dresses them up. She says they are very comfortable.
345610,1,"These are well made, very sturdy if you have problems with thin heels. They could use a bit of padding in the shoe, the inside is quite hard, would definitely recommend some gel inserts or such type thing."
47504,0,"The cayman i received fits fine and works fine. The details of the moldings, however, were noticeably less defined than the ones i bought last year. Upon closer examination, i noticed that the words MADE IN USA imprinted on the underside of the crocs on last year's model were replaced with MADE IN CHINA on this year's model. Perhaps THAT explains the lacking quality difference? Again it still works fine, but SORRY! I'm not paying $30 for crocs MADE IN CHINA that look like the cheaper chinese-made knock-offs! For those, the only things lacking are the cute little croc buttons on the sides. I'll buy other brands (albeit made in china) for a lot less."
343894,1,As i was leaving feedback i accidently pressed the no answer instead of the yes answer. i just wanted to correct that and say that the sneakers were brand new and shipped on time
128277,1,"Out of all 4 of my current Air Force military boots, this has to be the favorite. Wearing them, they feel like running shoes. They don't feel like your wearing you heavy combat boots. They're not steel or safety toed, they have a box toe only. If you want one of those installed in this, you're going to have to find a shoe guy somewhere in town to do it (I've seen them charge $50-people told me it's still worth it since they can only have steel toed boots in their job). If you're in the military, buy them at your MCSS (Military Clothing Sales Store) on base. At AAFES, they're under a hundred dollars ($98.95) and not tax of course. I do recommend you buy these. You have an excuse not to shine the rest of the boot since it has cloth and no worries of having it crack at the flexing point. I accidentally used a hose to wash vehicles, and the water didn't go through the cloth. They're not water proof, they're water resistant, so don't walk through a lake in them unless you have to. They dry fast since it's mostly cloth and not leather. My opinion, they look better than regular leather boots and require less polishing. If you do want someone to steel toe them and find a person to do it, they usually recommend to buy a half size larger than your foot."
241832,1,"The boots are fairly comfortable right out of the box. After several months, they have not begun to show any wear yet. The laces do feel a bit flimsy but haven't broken yet."
100167,1,I bought the bag in the whisky color. It looks cute and fashionable. Itself is quite spacious and perfect for mall shopping. Have got some compliments from strangers.
76699,1,"I have been using Deer Stag shoes, especially the ""Times"" model for ~20 years. They are both a good walking shoe and good looking dressier-than-most walking shoes. In addition, they require little or no break-in period, this is especially important to anyone who has sensitive feet. I'm a 79 year old male with tender feet and skin and I like to walk fast (3mph - 4 mph), so comfort is paramount for me.One caveat: The country of manufacture can make a big difference. I have a black pair of Deer Stag ""Times"" manufactured in Brazil and they do not have adequate padding around the edge or under the tongue. Consequently, they irrate the skin just below the ankles and around the heel. I doubt that I'll be able to use them even with sole inserts which help a bit.My comments in the first paragraph were about shoes manufacture in China and I would give them five stars. This is very surprising since I assume both countries are using the same specifications."
208770,0,"Bought this item from Bargain Outfitters. This is the last tme I buy from them. They listed the shipping weight as 2 pounds. I accordingly bought the item from them and had it freght forwarded to my overseas address. It turned out that they provided false information. the shipping weight was twice as much and I had to pay accordingly twice as much overseas shipping. When I contacted them about it they were telling me they are sorry I thought the shipping weight was different, in effect informing me that I do not know how to read their specific shipping weight ino they provide on Amazon. They refuse their mistake and would not provide a good business gesture of waiving the already charged shipping weight. I do not trust someone who provides false info and does not admit it."
129750,1,It does not have quite the support I need in a shoe--wish that were not so as it is a beautiful shoe.I also need to have a heel that is rubberized as I found it easy to slip while testing out the shoe.
296704,1,"I bought these shoes to wear in my pottery studio, where clay gets on everything. They are very comfortable, even while standing on a hard concrete surface for long periods of time. I just throw them in the sink to rinse the clay off - whereas before I had to wear old tennis shoes that never got more than a surface wipe and were always dirty. The only issue I have had with them is that I have a high instep, and the top of my foot tends to stick to the upper of the shoe in one spot when I don't wear socks. Otherwise, they are great."
34089,1,I found these to be a perfect fit. They are very comfortable and great for those long shopping trips. Look very nice with both casual dress and jeans.
25404,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
52910,0,I love SoftSpot shoes and have purchased many! But this pair was slightly flawed. One of the leather strips on the front of the shoe left an open space more than twice as wide as the other strips on the shoe.
47957,1,Bought these for watering in the yard in the morning. Ideal for that task. Quickly slip on and off and comfortable
155721,1,"I love Eastland shoes! The Plainview Lace-Up Oxfords are well made, comfortable, and nice looking under a pair of jeans. What adds to the level of comfort is the fact that these shoes come in wide widths. I wear these shoes all the time. They're comfortable enough that I don't think about them at all once I've put them on."
242129,1,This was a very good deal and was a fast delivery. I highly recommend this seller to all.
214307,1,"My children got me a brown pair for Christmas. I loved them, so I ordered a black pair. When I received them, the rope around the ankle was white....looked worn out. I was going to return them & get another pair, but I didn't get an invoice with my order. I wasn't happy with that, so I took a black laundry pen, and colored it in, & it looks fine. They are very warm. I got them a little larger than my shoe size in case I wear a thick sock. I would definitely recommend these boots."
191988,1,COMET SHOES IS AWESOME!! I MADE A MISTAKE AND HAD TO SEND THEM BACK AND THEY RETURNED WITH THE RIGHT PAIR SOOOO QUICK!! AWESOME BUY
309660,1,"I love the shoes. They are great, shipping was good and thanks. I can't wait to order more."
269344,1,This was the seventh or eighth purchase of this make and model shoes so obvioulsy I am very satisfied with them.
342500,1,The shoes are WONDERFUL! They fit perfectly and feel great on the feet. I'm sure my wife will be ordering more of them in the future.
266321,0,"I'm on my third pair of these. I wore out the first two on my daily 3-mile walk. Now, one year into these, the left boot has started to crush my left big toe as it flexes when I walk. There is still plenty of sole left but I'm afraid I can't wear these again. I have really liked this particular boot for hiking and walks but I'm afraid I'm going to have to look for something else to replace it.2013-01-23: Update. I didn't wear these for a couple of weeks and then I tried them on a 3-mile walk tonight. They were JUST FINE. My left foot must have just been sensitive for some other reason which caused the problem described above. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again when these wear out."
156578,2,Problem with this shoe is that they don't carry my size 8.5 double E. So why is that I am having a problem finding my size. Is there some kind of conspiracy going on the the size department. To me there is no excuse of not carring my size.
366395,1,"Hello;I recvd my pair of Keens just before leaving for New Zealand and had a day of wearing them, loved the feel and how tough they felt. I wore them on the Brutal 22 hour flight and the odor core on them definately works. We went on a pretty easy trek on Mt. Pirongia for about an hour, when we got back I noticed that the back of the heel was coming apart, Bummer.. So I was not a happy camper! We just got back last week and I have just sent them back to Mt.Gear and hope to get an exchange. I'm just hoping that it is a defect. I met a lot of people in NZ who have Keen's and have not had any problems, so I am counting the days to get a replacement.Overall Great Sandal... But did't last very long less than 2 weeks."
100772,1,"I was paranoid that the shoes would be tight but stuck with the size 10 since my daughter had just gotten a few new pairs of street shoes in 10s. We always err on the larger size so that shoes will last for a bit! She just wore them to her first ballet class and the shoes were perfect, with a little room to grow. She even wore them w/out tights since I didn't have them yet, and was perfectly comfortable. I always wore Capezio shoes for ballet throughout my childhood and will certainly stick with the brand for my daughter."
136240,1,"The Last time I wore a pair of these, my codename was Roadrunner, fastest boy in the universe...lol.I bought these more for the nostalgiathan anything else.I have no complaints"
308513,1,"let me preface by saying that my previous shoes were $350 (I pre-ordered and received them the day they came out) bright orange, F50 prime, that weighed 5 oz each. COOL! is what everybody thought about those rocket boots. I still love them even though they are all stretched and worn out after about a year of daily use. I also have my older F50 adizero chameleons (now cleaned up and for display) and those were more than double the price of the copa as well. Now, I still prefer the orange primes over my new copas when it is wet and muddy, because they are plastic they can be hosed off easily and forgotten about until needed again. I knew I needed to move away from F50s when they came out with the micoach computerized model. because I dislike micoach and it's generally very-buggy software. (a former micoach pacer addict, here).NOT HOT...You need to take care of them. I tried the shower trick when they were new and treat them often about once a week at least with leatherfood from eurosport. Traction is slightly less. They do not run as fast. (if you haven't worn out several pairs of top line F50s then you will probably just say ""lame excuse, you just can't run as fast as you want to""... my 100m PR is 11s even and I can do a 5k in 16:50) They just don't feel as fast as the TOTL synthetics; in football speed isn't everything.So the copa traction is not as good, the speed is not as good. They are more than double the weight. So... what makes these shoes worthy of a 5 star review???SMOKING HOT...here the magic of the copa comes in. Whatever hesitation I would have, that extra touch I always felt I needed before letting off a shot or pass, it's gone. I am finally at the point where I can start learning juggling tricks. I've been playing since I was 4 and up through HS of course, but about a year ago I really stepped up my game. I worked hard to get where I am, and I'm not letting shoes take the credit for that. but I do think they help.Some day, adidas (and nike and friends) will figure out how to make a plastic shoe with better touch than K-leather. but that day has not yet come. You will be able to have your boot custom made exactly to your foot as precision-measured by a robot. but that day has not yet come. You will be able to print your own designs on your boots in any colour of the rainbow. but that day has not yet come. Everybody in the world will be able to afford a pair, and they will last forever. unless you want a new pair, and then the old boots will instantly turn into delicious cookies and beer. but that day has not yet come. Until that day comes I don't see anything better than copas, for me.If you look in the dictionary under football cleat you will see a picture of adidas copa. I'm no superstar; I pay to play, I don't get paid to play. I'm like everybody who just wants to have fun on the field and if you are the same, you should at least consider your next shoes a pair of copas too.That being said, if you've been wearing copas for the last four hundred years, and would never, ever, consider anything else, go out and try on the latest obscenely-expensive, all-synthetic, high-fashion boot. You may just be pleasantly surprised. At least enjoy modern technology once in a while. I will be buying another pair of F50s before long. I am simply addicted to the speed and the colours.P.S. Messi wears F50s, sure. but he wears very special leather F50s, not plastic ones. If I want to be like messi I will wear his shirt of which I have several. Not his latest adidas boot..."
16020,0,"When I recieved the Skecher shoes they were great, but for some reason the expected delivery dates were incorrect. On amazon.com I was told to expect my shipment by August 28th. When I did not recieve the shoes by that date, I emailed Bealls in Florida and was told that my shipment was on schedule and would be delivered by August 31st. I'm unsure why Bealls was unaware that the expected delivery date on amazon.com was different than what they emailed to me, but I would recommend that Bealls consider that when responding to future customers. I'm unsure whether I will purchase from Bealls again."
72010,1,I love these boots. They're so much fun! Don't let the height of the heel scare you...the platform actually makes the heel shorter when it comes to foot placement. Only problem - the laces don't stay laced when they're not on your feet. You'll have to relace them each time.
294848,1,"Loafers are such an irresistable throwback - and lacking tassles, this model sets you apart from the gregarious boardroom/country club crowd. They're just perfectly classic. Not cheap, but the leather is high quality and the workmanship is outstanding. Skimp on dress shoes and the result is simply cheap-looking shoes. Match these to most any outfit and you will get compliments and feel light on your feet."
131933,1,I recently purchased a pair of the Reebok DMX Walking shoes while on vacation in nothern California. I have a pair of New Balance 842 Walking shoes that I normally use but I left them at home. The Reebok DMX Max Walking shoes have been a pleasant surprise. They are comfortable and have the feeling of walking on air. They were also about half the price of my New Balance 842s. I did considerable walking while in northern California up and down hills and on flat land and my legs really never got tired. I now use them at home over my New Balance 842s. I normally walk 3 1/2 to 5 miles a day.
124256,1,This purchase was a replacement product and therefore a known entity. It is a good and useful summer sandal that meets a need. Ordering and shipping were on schedule and as described.
40546,1,They are very comfortable and has a support arch which is just perfect. I am getting them in every color!
205697,1,"I had the originals back in grammar school in 1969 & always loved them.I have gained weight in the ensuing years & needed a very supportive shoe, so I looked into these again.This is a great shoe with lots of support for very overweight people, & highly recommended for them."
296961,1,"I got this pair of shoes two monthes ago. I wore this one for a couple of days each week and felt very satisfied with the price, the quality and the style. My friend can't believe I get this stylish shoes for just $19.99. This shoes is very light and comfortable. I like it vey much."
283106,1,"These slippers are very cozy and comfortable. They felt a little snug across the foot at first, but that may have been because my old slippers were very loose. In any case, I like the fit now. The sole is cushiony and springy, but not too much so. The microfiber fabric is quite soft and feels good against your feet."
388694,1,These shoes are comfortable as well as long lasting. They do not make your feet sweat or smell bad like other high top shoes. This shoe never goes op of style
314404,1,"they fit a lil big, but are comfy overall. Just wear thicker socks. Wouldn't recommend for someone with wide feet being that they run narrow."
124954,1,"I bought these sandals for my mom because they looked nice and were from Softspots a company I love. She hasn't worn them out yet but reportrd them to be very comfortable. Just what we were looking for. Excellent product as usual. I highly recommend,"
389594,0,I had to get these for a wedding. Let's just say technology has made more modern shoes more comfortable. Liked 'em more when I was 8.
67226,1,"I love these shoes a LOT! The shipping was super fast and the shoes are just GREAT!!! I don't want to take them off, they're so comfortable and very pretty. An added bonus: this company was so kind and sent a purse sized hand sanitizer. That was very thoughtful of them. I highly recommend this seller to anyone that loves great shoes, great prices and super fast shipping. Thank you for making this a happy friday."
306577,0,this is a really good shoe for the price. it is comfortable. a little thin unless you run on PERFECT level ground.
248217,1,"Good boots, my only complaint is that they have stretched significantly and are now a bit loose after so much wear."
56628,1,"I was so happy to receive it on the day it camebecause my other sneakers was worn out becauseit was torn, and I finally put my other sneakers inthe trash because I finally got this new sneakersto wear."
334658,1,"Just throwing my 2 cents in here - these shoes are fantastic. Great mature look with jeans. The bottom will become black very quickly but is only noticeable when you have your legs crossed or feet on a table or something. I get lots of compliments on them. I prefer these boots to the lower cut ones which I also have. I normally wear a size 11.5 but a 10.5 works perfectly in these, so maybe take that into account."
279297,1,"Mono-Black Chucks are amazing utility shoes. I wear mine when:* working (with tie)* sledding* partying* hiking* gardening* attending black tie formal events (yes really)Ironically, the thing Chucks are bad for is the shoe's original intended purpose: athletics & sports."
81172,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
307000,1,"Clarks has been my favorite brand for a long time, because they make footwear that is comfortable, wears well, and is stylish and attractive.These boots are no exception. The heel is not too low nor too high. I can put them on and not worry about how much walking I might be doing, and they look great. I have gotten many compliments on them."
196319,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
375853,1,"The boots looked durable, and had a very nice sole. The issue was that they were huge :/ the same size in a pair of Ariat riding boots fit him, but these gave at least an extra inch or two of space in the toe box. I hope to get a proper refund and possibly order again in the right size..."
273885,1,I purchased these boots for my father who lives in Maine. They were exactly what he wanted. He says they are warm and very easy to pull on and take off.
39283,1,These are excellent shoes with a lot of support. I wear them at work and to hike in. They're very tough.
255400,1,"These sandals are a great buy. They are really comfortable, look great and feel like they will last a long time. I may get another pair!"
31708,1,I like these type of shoes for when I travel and I have to visit the gestapo at my local airport. It makes compliance with this regime a little bit quicker. I don't have to untie my laces or anything like that before the minimum wage federal employee sticks his hands all over me.
17429,1,Classic Vans. The style hasn't changed in more than 10 years. I've had mine for that long. I've skated them for that long too. Super comfortable when they're broken in and will last you for years. Vans for life.
214193,1,I ordered these for my 14 yr old daughter. She absolutely loves them. She says they are very comfortable - like walking on clouds. They look really good on her and keep her feet nice and warm. I would definitely recommend these boots.
385971,1,"This is the 2nd pair of these same shoes I've purchased (from Amazon), and I love them! They fit just as expected, are lightweight, and have a really versatile color. Since they're a neutral color, I can wear them with both casual clothing and slightly nicer clothes like khakis with an untucked polo. I may even buy another pair in 3 or so years when this pair wears out!"
317319,1,"The Naot Fiord is absolutely the best quality and most comfortable shoe that I have ever worn! I have had several pairs and they never dissapoint. I have several foot problems including: plantar fasciitis, old sports injuries, flat feet. But with these shoes, I can stand and walk all day and my feet don't hurt.Pros:1. Easy on/off2. Lots of airflow to keep your feet cool3. Very comfortable and conforming to the foot4. Fast break-in5. Wear extremely well - very sturdy6. Very good valueCons:1. None with this shoe!!! However, like with any clog, you have to be smart as to when and where you wear them. For example, it's not adivsable to wear these for trail hiking. You also have to be a little careful up or down flights of stairs that you don't have one slip off.Conclusion:Absolutely recommended!!!"
377515,1,I bought these for my boyfriend. Very comfortable and true to size. He thought that the low back would be bothersome but it isn't. I have bought him other slippers in the past and the Tamarac are best by far and at a good price.
295152,1,"I love these, they are great for walking on slippery areas. I feel very confident when wearing them. Still have to be careful on glare ice but better than nothing for sure."
266233,1,"I've had these out on two long hikes now and all I can say is that these boots are perfect. Super comfy on the inside and super tough on the outside. My feet stayed cool and dry all day. Great boots, highly recommended especially for the price."
147334,1,Love them. Very cold here today in DC. They keep my feet very warm. Great for winter weather anywhere. Like!!
327225,1,"These are great shoes for work in an office. They are comfortable all day and look very nice with several styles from business casual to professional. Thanks for another great pair of shoes, Softspots!"
227014,1,"Exactly as advertised the famous Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneaker is a great buy! Looks great, fits great and is super comfortable. I highly recommend it!"
377004,1,"I am on my feet 12 or more hours a day. Cement floors and high activity have destroyed multiple sets of shoes. I have bough some brands and totaled them in 3-4 months. The only thing showing wear is the finish. The toes are scuffed up from crawling and moving around working on equipment. If there is work to be done I am all over it. My shoes better be prepared to take it all. These Wolverines are comfortable and solidly built.When I do finally give them more then they can handle, I will be buying another set to replace them. I would love a more durable toe area for lasting beauty but I don't want to give up the comfort that these shoes offer to my hard working feet."
201250,0,Boat shoes. Brown. Do not wear on anything slippery unless you want to fall. Somewhat comfortable but they feel very thin. I guess boat shoes are like this but i have worn other sperrys that feel better and safer.At least they look pretty good and seem well made.
148140,1,"This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He loves them, says they are really comfortable, and slide on easily!"
6122,1,"Love them, just can't wear 'em. They run 1 size too small. I have the black size 9. Yes, I Should have bought a 10. What do I do now, try to swap someone? Any suggestions? Also, Is it me or do most boots run smaller now? On the positive side, they have a great zipper that runs all the way down to the soul. The buttons are merely decorative. If you have a larger calf, I wouldn't go with this style. Attractive heels are 3"" high with souls that aren't slippery. An affordable yet solid boot."
186201,1,I hadn't owned a pair of Frye boots for more then 30 years when I purchased these Frye Engineer Boots recently. I had forgotten how comfortable Frye boots are. It took about a day to break them in. The sizing was good and of course Amazon was right on time with delivery. I won't buy any other companies boots from here on out.
52488,1,"I needed a pair sneakers that were extra wide (8.5 EEEE) and had good arch supports. Propet sneakers are comfortiable, run true to size and have good arch supports. Plus they have a guarantee to last one thousand miles of walking."
375010,1,"This is my first pair of Danner boots, and I must say that they are the most comfortable boots I have ever owned."
146685,1,"I have bought this shoe for work, play and just plain walking for 5 years. They are the best. I use special insoles inside and I have the best fit and feel ever. Highly recommend them to everyone."
267277,1,"I have worn Hi-Tec boots for many years now. This is my third pair of Altitude boots. They are comfortable, durable and relatively inexpensive. The boots are great for day hikes these are a good boots for light to moderate loads. If you are looking for a stiff boot for heavy backpacking I would recommend looking at another model of boot. Hi-Tec makes other model boots specifically for backpacking with heavier loads."
218823,0,"I usually get the more target brand converse in a size 8, which fit great, but when I ordered these in a size 8 they were uncomfortable. They felt just slightly too big and didn't fit well around my foot, I don't think ordering a half size down would have helped. I tried to break them in, but they gave me blisters, twice!"
8589,1,"Bought a pair about 6 years ago from Sportsman Guide for about 1/2 this price .Weared well for about 5 years before they gave out , wished I had bought several more pairs at that cheap price .Because of my extremely wide , but short foot size I don't have much choice in selection of shoes/boots .After replacing the foot incert with a better arch , softer surface they fit pretty nice and know it will break in pretty good .Even though they are black, they vent/breath pretty good and are water resistant up to 2 or 3 inchs .They are also very lite to wear , and if they are as good as the other Propet boots i hope to get another 5 years of use from them ."
287229,0,"These were a good deal for the price paid, though they seem to run a half size smaller than labeled."
373009,1,Good and quick. Love the shoes although it was a bit confusing whether it was hi top or not as it showed up differently on my order form. But it was hi-tops and I'm happy :-)
51021,0,"This has been a decent winter running shoe with plenty of stability, fair amount of cushion, and decent traction. My primary gripe has been the insert not staying in place and riding back in the shoe."
4744,1,"I use this shoe for training and for racing, for long runs and for interval workouts. My weekly mileage is in the 30-38 mile range, and the Green Silence is a nice, light ride. I believe the weight is advertised as 8.3 ounces, and without getting out my wife's food scale, I'd say that's a pretty accurate estimate. My sense is that there's a limit to the number of miles I'd take this shoe. The cushioning is limited, but the overall feel is pleasantly surprising. Short distances feel really smooth; longer distances slightly less so, compared to traditional trainers. The payoff, though, is the lightweight feel and speed--the exact qualities I want in a shoe when I'm looking to do faster training."
170169,1,"Actually allowed me to put my orthotics inside these shoes. Usually my orthotics only fit in athetic shoes, so I was pleased. I do have hammer toes, and got a few red spots on top of my toes, but I don't know how I could have avoided that."
45590,2,Bought these for my husband and was wondering why they were so cheap. We love New Balance. But these were made in China!! What's up New Balance? We love you cause you're made in the USA!!!
148699,0,The shoe is exactly what it is supposed to be. The only issue i had is that the felt on the front of each shoe started to come off after just a few rehearsals. I glued them back on and they are fine now. A little annoyed I had to do that for the amount these shoes cost
58256,1,Love these boat shoes. A+++++for comfort in the front toes and back heel. Hope they sell other colors. Nice construction.
70632,0,"When I opened the box, I was very happy to see how totally cute these shoes were. But when I put them on, the toe was very narrow. I didn't want anything that I would need to stretch, so I sent them back. BUMMER!"
347274,1,MY GRANDSON ORDERED THESE FOR HIS CHRISTMAS GIFT AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH THEM. THEY WERE THE PERFECT FIT AND VERY COMFORTABLE FOR HIM.
742,1,"Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
258318,1,"I bought these shoes for my Granddaughter, she loves it. She said &#34;they are so soft and comfy, I can dance all day and night and they do not hurt&#34;.She is happy and so am I."
99209,1,"If you buy a Chuck Taylor, you know want you want, they are the classics, fits right usually I use 7 1/2 but in this case the 8 size fits better, most comfortable."
157564,2,"these shoes are classics and I can't fault the style. My son actually wore them for a wedding (with suit and all), however, they run large (long) and had to be sent back. I found them at the last minute at a local store in the right size. We ordered the 12 but he ended up buying 10.5. It cost me $12.50 to send them back so it was kind of an expensive mistake. Always get free return shipping where you order. Just saying."
129042,1,"Super comfy and light. I like the zipper sides, easy to put on and take off.Always been a fan of 5.11 products because of the quality. Shipping was fast."
224927,0,"Bought this for my cousin, he said it an big about half to a whole size. He's an 8.5 and i bought him the 8.5 and its big on him but he was fine with it since he wears thick socks anyway. The color black was really nice and the design as well. As for the quality, can't speak for it right now since we just got it but so far upon close inspection when i got the shoes, it look durable and made well so hopefully it'll last long."
275077,0,These were my first pair of boots. Bought them for motorcycle safety training (needed footwear that covered the ankles) & been using them sparingly over the last year. The shoes are a nice dark shade of black but the lace rings are a little too shiny for my liking. Price could be cheaper too. No other complaints.
42547,1,I got these a few weeks ago and have loved them. Good support in the arch and heel and no rubbing. The spikes are pretty sharp so they make good trail running shoes. You can take the spikes out with a key (provided) and they make good track shoes.
254550,0,"I loved the way the boot looked with jeans/pants; however, I could never wear them with a skirt because there was about an inch or more of a gap at the top where it should have been flush with my calf. I do not have abnormally skinny calfs, so this was a big let-down. I love the fact that these boots were all leather! Fine quality just not the right fit!Wish that Nine West made the same boot with a smaller upper! I'd buy em in a heart-beat!"
132883,1,These are classics. I used to rock these back in my high school days. I saw some legit colorways so I picked up a few of them. They are very comfortable and light.
387854,1,"CROCS ""BEACH CLOG"" model is just as awesome as the ""SPECIALIST"" model which I love so much. This model averages $23 and may be the model so many people think about when they say Crocs are ugly. I have news for you, but you should believe your own eyes: CROCS ARE NOT UGLY.No matter how ugly you may think they are, once you try on a pair, you will never want to take them off - guaranteed. This model as you see is riddled with Swiss-cheese-style holes. It's good ventilation for summer, but I think you'll be pretty hot under the collar if it rains. That cold rain gets into these holes faster than spinach into Popeye!Otherwise, you can't pass up the chance to own a couple of pairs of this style. It is comfort, good support, ease of maintenance, hard-wearing, and you will find your color and size, just read the options carefully.CROCS: THEY AIN'T UGLY, THEY'S SNAPPY!"
29005,1,"This shoe is well made, comfortable, and stays looking good. You can wear this shoe everyday if needed and it will last a long time and stay looking new. It goes with everything, so it's perfect for your everyday shoe."
296817,0,"Based on previous reviews about these running big, I ordered my 'normal' size 11 knowing a bit big is far better than a bit small. When the shoes arrived, they were very snug. I had to return and order a half size larger. (good thing Amazon's ordering/return system works so well) Receive the 'right' size as promised. The shoes are pretty comfortable but do have a few quirks. First off, there is a slight pinch on the top of the big toe where the leather bends while walking. Secondly, there is a decided 'pop' in the leather with each step, again in the toe area as the leather bends then relaxes with each step. I'm hopeful that once worn a bit, both issues will remedy themselves. The shoes are very nice looking and I've had several compliments on them already. The toe pinch does seem to be going away and I hope the popping sound does as well. The shoes appear to be very well made. They are not light as the sole seems to be very durable. All in all, I'm glad I ordered them as I expect them to be great shoes. Just not the slipper feel I'd hoped for, but are very comfortable none the less."
56575,1,"I'm a nurse, I work in the ER and in the hospital med-surg. I have bought these shoes over the past 15 years. They last and last and then I buy them again. They are like walking on clouds!"
232398,1,Great shoe! Love the selection of colors! A must have!
303574,1,"I ordered these boots because of the wonderful reviews they'd gotten. We found them to wear very well here at the farm. Worn nearly everyday for cowboy boots intended purpose, our only complaint was that the toes came detached from the sole. This happened with both pairs we ordered. After a little super glue to repair the problem, they've been great and appear as they will be outgrown before they wear out. They're certainly a 10 on the cute scale and will wear like steel if they're being worn in an urban setting and not the pasture and barn. Would order again."
259565,0,"I LOVE the style of Converse, always have. But the quality of the shoe is going down :(. I have had my black pair (They look just like the ones in the pic) for about 2 years now, and they're pretty much starting to fall apart already. I dont even wear them everyday! Very disappointed in the quality nowadays, but they are still stylish. (Until they fall apart)"
73776,1,"I have to say that I don't like crocs on adults. They are comfortable, sure... but there are other shoes that are as comfortable and not so ... absurd looking.But I did buy a black pair for my 2 year old daughter. She looks totally cute in them and she LOVES them. Unfortunately they are a bit large around the toe box and she tripped over her feet while wearing them. So now we have relegated them to bedtime shoes (meaning she can wear them to go to bed at night only, concessions, concessions).I think when she's a bit bigger and her foot fits inside them a little better, she will be able to wear them out and about. But right now the size 6/7 is too big for her 5.5 narrow feet and cause injury."
304073,1,Lasts about 6 months with daily 4-mile walks on pavement. Lasts about a year in the gym with exercise equipment. I get good angle support and good arch support. Washes well.
362492,1,Having a wide foot they fit a little on the narrow side - I kept them knowing that canvas will probably stretch without to much problem. Also my shoes make a slight hollow sound from one of the baby toe tips; I'm assuming with time that too will abate.
32813,1,These boots for perfect for my daughter costume. They are well made and look adorable. She now wears them often. Well worth the money!
67657,1,"I have worn out one pair of these boots and am now on a new pair. I love that they are tough, warm, and comfy. They continue to look good for a long time. I wear them to work in the winter months with dress pants. I get compliments about them a lot. If you want warmth and duribility - here's your boots."
388228,1,"TROOP Footwear is back for the 2k3 and they are hot. These shoes not only look amazing, they some of the most comfortable shoes ive ever wore. they are definately worth ever penny i spent on them. Anyone who knows the TROOP story will tell you that these shoes were one of the hottest shoes to come out back in 85'. This new line out is made by averix and they have totally done justice to the name. I recommend you pick yourself up a pair or too, either on here on Underground station, Shoe City, or any other store you can find them. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do."
264982,1,"My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
26783,1,"I never thought I would find something like this especially in time for Christmas, thank you so much- they are awesome looking and the recipient will absolutely LOVE them as a Christmas Gift. I will be a returning customer for life."
298538,1,"I have put about 15-20 miles on the boots already, but they seemed to work well the first time out. The sole is structurally sound, and the uppers supportive. I am confident to hike over rough, rocky terrain with these boots. They looked especially good after applying Danner's Boot Dressing suitable for gortex lined boots. The uppers are a little stiff if laced tight; which is good for steep downhill to keep your toes out of the end. However, on flat ground I have installed 2 sets of shorter laces. The first set for the first five holes (like a low hiking boot), and the second lace for the upper four holes ...tied looser so I don;t spend so much energy flexing the uppers all day long."
251026,1,These boots are very appealing and comfortable to wear. They are also very reasonably priced. Would recommend to my friends.
386530,0,"I bought these shoes because I'm an aspiring hipster and I thought they would make me cool. Well, they did, but they started falling apart after about two month. I have pretty wide feet, but these fit me fine. They just decided one day that my feet weren't getting enough ventilation, I guess, so they popped open on the sides and just above my big toes. Now they're even more comfortable, but I look like a vagrant--which is very hip, I guess."
351272,1,"I bought 3 pairs of Minnetonka brown hardsole slippers for my Grandkids and nephew. I could not find them in stock anywhere for Christmas until I went om Amazon.com. The kids love them and wear them outside. I would recommend these slippers to everyone. I had to send a pair back for size and my Mother-In-Law was here for Christmas and i showed them to her and they fit her so i gave them to her. When she went home she told me she wears them outside all the time and loves them. I also bought a wireless printer,Kodak Camera with 30xzoom which is amazing. My husband collects Invictus Watch's and i got a great deal on the watch."
34586,1,I love these shoes. Have been wearing them for years and hope Easy Spirit does not EVER stop making them! Great support for tired feet!
12558,1,"These shoes were exactly what my son wanted for Christmas. He loves them. They run true to size and they are comfortable. He has a hard time keeping the tongue straight on the shoes. When he tightens the laces, it will stay in place."
191302,1,"I have another pair of these shoes and loved them; therefore, I purchased the pair through Amazon at a good price."
109037,0,"This very attractive little sandal would probably be very satisfactory, but it runs both short and narrow. It is not true to size by any means, so rather than return them, I gave them to a cousin with smaller feet. They were on sale. Now I know why."
262777,1,"For all of those people who would rather pet the animals than wear them, these are the shoes for you! Converse has been making ""Chuck Taylor's"" longer than I have been alive and not one animal has lost it's life to make them! The only downside to Converse is that they are not the most comfy shoe, however, a insole insert fits rather nicely into them and then your good to go."
203217,1,I bought these for our trip to Maui since we were expecting to do a lot of walking and hiking. I fell in love with them the minute I put them on. They have good support which I need since I have high arches. They were perfect for hiking and dry well when they get wet. I will definitely buy these again!
194950,1,"This are super confortable shoes if you do not mind the 'men' look. Great with pants. Wear for 8h or longer with no pain, padding is extraordinary. The brown is beautiful."
267458,1,Received these boots today and I have to tell you they are great. My feet after 74yrs hurt after taking my walk but i went today for a mile and my feet feel great. Now if i can get my hips to stop hurting we will be ready for that five mi.Thanks Hi-Tec AND AMAZON For the great price and fast shipping.
240211,1,Just purchased those shoes for my brother andhe is satisfied above and beyond.A very light and comfortable feeling he told me.New Balance were and always will be the best sport shoes for me.You wan't be sorry for purchasing this particular one.5 stars !
157945,1,The shoe itself is cute! Very bright colorful...and well pink. The only worry/complaint i have is that maybe its a bit too big? Maybe the reviews i read after i bought the item scared me making me wish that i would have gone down a size. So instead of an 8 maybe a 7.5 would have been nice? Well what can you do...you cant shrink em and they are cute. Im sure i can work it all out! The delivery estimate of the package was right on time. The seller was awesome! So all in all its pretty good :P
58670,1,"Great quality for the money. Hate the heaviness of most tennis shoes, these are light weight and good support without making my feet feel heavy"
148870,1,"I love this shoe because it is dressy, classy and comfortable...and a flat. I search extensively for the shoe with the proper look to wear with my suits. This shoe is it!! In addition to coming in various colors -- it comes with a patent tip/heel. And did I say comfortable? There is no traditional break-in period. The shoe just molds itself to your foot (soft leather). A must have."
337508,1,"My son like the boot, it fit well and is water proof. We received the boot just a few days after ordering it."
246930,1,Wonderful experience! I received my package in one day. The shoes had one flaw in the leather but other than that it was a great experience.
290045,1,I always buy Reeboks (black).1. I have big feet so they dont stand out as much when I get black ones2. They always last a long time3. They are comfortable and I can wear them to work even though we cant have gym shoes
121783,1,These are the most comfy pair of thongs (flip flops)I have ever owned plus you never have to look for a bottle openner.
172837,1,"These are the most comfortable shoes I've had in recent memory. I have both the black and dark brown. The black ones especially are dressy enough for work and most things I do, yet are great to take a nice walk. They seem well made, though I haven't had them long enough to know for sure. Great shoes, though."
16139,1,My daughter is small size that we could not find it in a sport store. She is using it a lot for competition and she love them. Arrived on time.
361795,0,"Nice-looking shoe, but too expensive. For big foot guys like me, makes your feet look a lot smaller."
73501,1,Bought these shoes for my teenage son.He loves them - still wearing them after two years.The great part of Vans is that the size is consistent around the world.
326543,1,"I thought the straps on this would bother me after parting with my old leather-strapped Reefs, which are no longer sold. I bought these along with a newer version of leather straps, and I favor these, surprisingly. I love them, and haven't had any problems with them yet!"
94915,1,"This is a pair nice pair of boots with very comfortable inner lining of soft leather and an apparently impossible-to-damage sole. However, this pair will be a living hell for anyone for the first 2-3 days! I read some reviews about this pair of boots being very tight and smaller than normal size, and initially I regretted my decision of buying this. The first day of wearing this to work, I had to remove this pair towards the end of the day (after first removing the sock, and then go on limping for the entire day) and go home barefoot. But the second time I wore it, it was a little better and now it fits snuggly and comfortably. I now know why it happened.First, I had this problem only on my left foot. I am a prominently left handed (though considerably ambidextrous) person and so, the left side of my body is a little bigger than the right side. For a right-handed person, it will be the other way around. The second and most important point is that, unlike lace shoes, there is no option of pulling and tightening in the boots with zipper, and so they must fit perfectly once they are broken in. As of today, I can wear a thin pair of socks and this boots comfortably, though the first 30 minutes of so, I feel a mild squeeze on my left feet. Mind you, I have worn this pair only on a total of 6 days until now, and I am pretty sure that within the next couple of weeks, it will be 100% perfect for my feet.For those who said that this boot gets a worn-out look with the leather developing many creases, I could get it all shiny simply by using a brush of medium hardness (without using any polish).My suggestion: If you want to buy this pair to go out on a date, attend a party of a wedding, probably you are headed for pain and agony (and bad mood, and some swearing too, if you are as uncivil a person as I am!). But if you are a man with patience to wait and break it in, and this is not going to be your only pair of boots, probably this is a nice pair to buy and enjoy, with an occasinal little squeeze notwithstanding."
85587,1,"Our third pair in 10 years.....my husband's absolutely favorite slippers......Kind of expensive for slippers, however, they last a long time and are more comfortable.The sheepskin keeps your feet warm in the winter and cool in the summer."
150971,1,"The Supernova Cushion by Adidas has been around for years, and there's a reason why it's so popular among runners--comfort! I run about 25 miles a week, and i absolutely love this shoe. I have narrow, high arched feet, and the Supernova Cushion makes my long runs a breeze. It fits true to size, but remember to buy a 1/2 size up when purchasing running shoes if you plan to run greater than a few miles at a time."
258365,1,"These shoes are much more soft and flexible than they look in the picture. I thought they looked rather firm -- kind of like those adult clogs made with cork soles and very firm wool uppers, if you're familiar with those. But one of the reviews said they had a flexible sole, so I took a chance, since these are just so adorable. I'm glad I did!The shoe is a little heavier than average, but by no means too heavy. The sole is a soft, grippy rubber that flexes very easily, and there's even arch support! The upper is a cotton-poly blend that has the soft texture of well-worn khaki pants, with a terry lining. I got the medium, which looks to be equivalent to a size 4.I got the pink dragonfly version; I just wish they'd bring back the green dragonfly version, as I think the frog looks a little strange (and unhappy!)."
126747,1,These shoes were beautiful. My sister loved them today at Christmas. They arrived in plenty of time for Christmas and were packaged neatly. This was a great gift.
10626,1,"I have wide feet, so the fit could be a little better, but I did order regular sizes... I wear a 10W-11M, and ordered a 10M and it fit just fine, I can't imagine how baggy and slippery anything bigger would be. It's adjustable with the tiny bow elastic. I wish I would have stain guarded them before wearing, they do pick up everything you are near. my 9 yeah old niece tried to get me to give them to her maybe 30 times, haha. I ordered her her own set for her birthday. Shh! I'm pleased. I'm not a dancer, well not in 15 years anyway, I ordered them for folding up in my purse to have when my high heels get too uncomfortable. They're gonna be way cuter than any other foldable flats!"
284802,1,I wish shoe makers would make 1/2 sizes. i purchased a 9b and it fit a little loose. I wear a 8 1/2 shoe and a 8 would have been to small and a 9 is a little to big. What is the problem with shoe makers making 1/2 sizes in these type shoes. Other wise the shoe feel good and since it is hard to find a red shoe in that style I like it.
386598,1,"Good product for a great price. I felt the difference in my comfort the first time I wore them on the dance floor. As a beginner, I did not want to spend a lot of money on a pair of shoes. I wasn't sure I would survive the dance lessons! That was weeks ago. I am still taking dance lessons and the shoes are still serving me well. I am more than pleased with my purchase."
371915,1,"These shoes are incredibly comfortable. One of the few shoes I've ever purchased that I can stand in them all day, and not complain about my feet hurting. It was a great buy, and the quality is excellent. Highly recommended."
20300,1,"the N width is almost impossible to find in stores, these guys have them & the shoes fit perfectly.I give this store & shoes an A+ across the board. Great price, great size, long wearing & very comfortable."
29959,1,"I have had foot problems for over 15 years. Heel Spurs, neuromas, ruptured heel gel capsules. My feet are a mess. So I am always on the lookout for a comfortable pair of shoes. I bought a pair three months ago. They have not been off my feet since. I love these shoes. They are great looking and are incredibly comfortable. If you are inclined to wear Ecco shoes, I would strongly recommend you give these a try. They are simpley the best ever. So much so now I need to get a pair in black."
163775,1,These shoes are great and comfortable for my daughter. Just be sure to order about 1 1/2 size UP with these. We ordered a 13 1/2 for my daughter and they were VERY tight! She needed a size 2 to have a little space in there.
188298,1,"Great looking pair of Oxfords. Extremely comfortable as well. I have a slightly broader foot, so the bicycle toe fits like a glove. And the funky graphic sole adds to the zing. Got a great price on amazon, just $40 as against the regular $130. How do these guys do it? Thanks amazon for the great price and free shipping to top it!!"

122206,1,I have been wearing these and the T22s for seven years. I buy a new pair about every 6 months and I play 3-4 times a week. They have a nice wide toe box and are unbelievably comfortable!!!!
144896,0,The customer service provided by Orva has been great in light of my poor feedback last week. They were very helpful
183616,1,"These shoes are incredibly light and wearing them after wearing construction shoes all day, make you want to run ! The material does not seem very strong but I guess all light weight shoes are like that. The sizing is a little screwed up. Size 10 is really size 9.5. So buy 0.5 sizes up. But You can still fit into ""your"" size and the shoes easily expand.The only annoying thing I found is that the footprint is so small that it feels like your feet are touching the ground at an angle. Maybe this is the right way to be running .. I dont know. I have run about 10 miles with these shoes so far and they seem to be adjusting ... so maybe after a few more weeks, I will get better used to having my feet touch the ground with these shoes. I am just used to shoes that touch the ground flat and your feet inside the shoes cannot rock them back and forth sideways ... but I guess a shoe this light and contoured does allow extreme flexibility and I am just not used to that.And note that while they provide very good grip on all sorts of wet and gainy pavement, they dont provide very much support at all so I can see a lot of potential ankle twists if you run with them ""out back"" like the name suggests. The small foot print I think will easily let your foot pivot in unnatural ways on loose soil.On tar and concrete though, they are excellent. An excellent and light running shoe. Just the sizing is screwed up and has a very bounded footprint."
318797,1,Hush Puppies Mall Walkers are an excellent product. Fit well. Good support. True to size. Highly recommend them for casual wear.Hush Puppies Men's Mall Walker Oxford
177023,1,"I ordered my usual size, but they were too small. Once I reorded a larger size, I am very happy with the shoe."
187964,1,These shoes a nice looking and feel good. I am diabetic and there is plenty of toes room. This also rest my legs which have been operated on because if bad circulation. I would recommend these shoes to anyone who has or doesn't have leg and foot problems.
283386,1,"These shoes are much more soft and flexible than they look in the picture. I thought they looked rather firm -- kind of like those adult clogs made with cork soles and very firm wool uppers, if you're familiar with those. But one of the reviews said they had a flexible sole, so I took a chance, since these are just so adorable. I'm glad I did!The shoe is a little heavier than average, but by no means too heavy. The sole is a soft, grippy rubber that flexes very easily, and there's even arch support! The upper is a cotton-poly blend that has the soft texture of well-worn khaki pants, with a terry lining. I got the medium, which looks to be equivalent to a size 4.I got the pink dragonfly version; I just wish they'd bring back the green dragonfly version, as I think the frog looks a little strange (and unhappy!)."
285869,1,liked these shoes because they come in narrow so I don't have excess velcro going over the sides of the shoe. The shoes start out kind of stiff but do break in.
177880,1,"love the boots. very comfortable and solid. seller was very accomadating when order was lost by shipper. overall, very pleased with purchase."
148959,1,Great looking shoe that can be dressed up or down. True to size and great dancing shoes with the leather soles.
281429,1,"The Puma Men's Roma Shoe is simple but classy, yet good for everyday use. A great selection of colors assures that you'll find a pair just right to fit your personality and wardrobe. Not only do these shoes look good, but they feel good also. I assure you will be satisfied with these shoes that will make you and your feet smile!"
40102,1,I first bought these on my honeymoon many years ago. We are now fortunate enough to live at the beach and I live in these shoes and have many colors of the same style. Shape to your feet wonderfully!!!!
252866,1,I love these shoes!I treat mine with SNO-Seal which waterproofs these shoes and makes cleaning them much easier!These run .5 size larger.
227509,0,"I just got these in the mail today, and I am unsure as to whether or not these shoes are legit. Although they came in a box, the shoes did not come with the ""Converse Chuck Taylor"" tags that usually come with the product. There are also some minor cosmetic issues (the stitching near the toe area of the shoes are uneven). Also, the label inside the tongue says that these shoes were made in Indonesia. The Converse that I used to wear were either made in China or Vietnam."
383528,1,"This is my second pair, in as many years. Comfortable, nice hieght and affordable."
343496,0,I like these but I bought the 8 1/2 wide and they are a little too short - but I still wear them. I will buy more grasshoppers in future but will get them in a 9 wide. I haven't worn them enough to be able to tell if they will wash easy but I expect them to.
370998,1,Happy with purchase.Customer Service was great when I emailed informing them that I had not recieved order.Order recieved 2 days later..........Thanks
372793,1,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND GOOD SERVICE PROVIDED BY YOUR TEAM, THEY ARE TRULY RELIABLE AND TIMELY I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PROVIDER AMONG MY FRIENDS."
233332,1,"Have been buying these shoes for about 17 years. I love shoes, but hate wearing them! These shoes I can wear comfortably from the get go. I was a little worried about size and quality changes as the last couple of pairs I bought were not true to size - I wrote the manufacturer to let them know. These are good, reliable, well made, comfortable shoes. And they come in lots of colors. Well done Enzo Angiolini for maintaining a great product and quality for all these years."
9159,0,did not wash well... price was great but doesn't seem like the same Keds that you buy in dept stores. Not real happy with them.
330253,1,"As a tall bloke, I like these shoes are they comfortable and fit well. They have a wide fitting, last years and look good for ages. Plus great value for money."
38736,1,"purchased these April of 2010, am very hard on shoes, could not fault these. tips of laces haven't lasted but the laces have. they have been drenched w/water oil, sweat & are finally stretched out a bit. will buy more. wish they came with smooth soles."
89752,1,"These slip-on shoes are the best walking to work shoes I have had. They are comfortable to wear for the whole day. And going up and down the stairs in the train station no longer seems like torture to my feet. The design is subdued enough for work environments (no flashing silvers or any other bright colors).It was a little bit expensive at 60 bucks, but I consider it money well spent on not having to worry about heel / ankle pain. Also, the bungee laces make it easy to slip on and gives a snug fit, so reduces the hassle of laces when I am in a hurry to get out to work.I have had these for about 4 months, and they are starting to show the wear and tear of being worn every weekday. The felt is looking a bit worn out. Hopefully, these shoes will last me at least a year."
354969,1,"Oh man I'd forgotten how easy these are to wear! Make sure and get 1 size smaller, they do run big no matter what they say at the shoe store. A classic that never goes out of style. I hadn't had a pair in years and these are rapidly becoming my ""go to"" pair of shoes.PLUS THEY'RE JUST PLAIN COOL!!"
270011,0,Not as comfortable as the world walking classic shoe . i would recommend the latter although the pro walker is less money
84740,1,"When I was a kid in the 70s, there were all kinds of new sneaker designs coming out, but nothing ever beat the reliable old standards, either Converse Chucks or Pro-Keds Court Kings. Those sneakers were great for any sport, they held up under abuse, and never went out of fashion for boys and girls alike. These Pro Keds are a bit of a play on the old design, and come in a wide variety of cuts, colors & materials. I've got several pairs of low-cuts, one pair in suede with natural (translucent brown) rubber toe, another made out of bright yellow tennis ball fuzz with white rubber, and this pair, shiny navy blue leather with light blue & white rubber. There are a variety of color combinations to pick from, in fact on the Keds website you could even make a custom pair for awhile. They are some of the toughest, well-made sneakers and incredibly comfortable as well. They're the ultimate casual weekend shoe, and the most recent ones I've gotten come with a lighter, shapely molded insert rather than just a flat foam rubber & canvas insert, giving better support. I wear a lot of Vans and Converse sneakers too, and honestly, the Pro-Keds are constructed more solidly than either of the other brands. They can stand up to serious abuse, especially the ones made out of leather."
317806,1,"My daughter loves yellow, and loves wearing crocs to the pool. They are comfy for her!"
29094,1,I bought these shoes before traveling to Europe. We did a TON of walking and I was comfortable the whole time. I would definitely recommned these shoes.
259634,1,This is my fourth pair of Asics Gel Nimbus shoes and I've yet to be disappointed
255003,1,"I was looking for some casual boots that look good with jeans, these are great, simple and comfortable! Recommend them!"
47066,0,"I am a 13.5 and often wear a 13 or 14 depending on brand. I'd read that these run large so I ordered a 13. They are about the right length, but feel too wide in the heel and ankle. They sometimes pinch at the big toe joint.They look great, and are generally well made. They don't seem perfect for my foot apparently."
21060,0,"I was looking for a shoe I didn't have to tie for my toddler. I bought this one because it was velcro. I put it on my son and his foot bulged out of the top, even though it's the size he was measured for in the store. He wore them and as the day went on, the tongue on the shoe slipped down. It's a cute shoe, but just didn't fit my son the way I had hoped."
197657,1,"I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
276841,1,"These boots are the best I've ever owned. So good, that I own two pairs, and bought my dad a pair. And he swears by them too. If you have aching feet, soreness, or a weak ankle, these boots have a therapeutic effect! I am not into medicine or anything but I have to say, these boots are very supportive and make your feet feel strong and no strain on the joints."
370311,1,"The boots are very comfortable and fit well (I ordered a half-size smaller than I wear in regular shoes because I was afraid they would be too big and I'm glad I did). They are very cool and a bit trendy with the very square, somewhat elongated toes but I like them because they're not too dressy or too casual... can wear them with just about anything. I will definitely buy more Steve Madden shoes!"
221089,1,"I've gotten two pairs of these, the vegan and the leather kind, I prefer the vegan they don't stretch out as much as the leather ones do they're very comfy, make cute nicer shoes I wouldn't say dress shoes but they're a step up from casual. They last a good year and a half with constant use which I wouldn't recommend. Not the best for work unfortunately. I like the idea and I really could feel the negative heel working my leg muscles more. Most surely recommend over the Sketchers shape ups."
113916,1,"these are a great classic shoe. not a ton of support but thats what i expected.when i opened the box i thought amazon had sent me the wrong color. i was expecting something more grey/khaki but got something that was more like army green. i guess i read khaki green in the description and overlooked the green part, ha. nevertheless i am enjoying these shoes. styyyyyyyyyyyylish."
298396,1,"The Elk Tracker 860 is a great pair of boots! I just ordered my second pair because they are the best boots that I have ever owned. My first pair lasted about six years and I put hundreds and hundreds of miles on them. I've used them for hunting, hiking, ice fishing and snow shoeing. I've even stood in the middle of streams while photographing and they never leaked a drop. I've used them on many 8 to 12 mile snow shoeing/ice fishing trips in Montana and my feet never got cold or sore or wet. The reason I purchased a new pair was because they did start to leak in very wet conditions this year."
280604,1,good shoes. they are comfortable and have very classic look! I love them! I would buy another pair of them next year!
168743,1,"I have a wide foot, a high arch, and need good support for walking. These are perfect, offering good stability on various surfaces. I'm on my 3rd pair of these--so glad they haven't been discontinued! For me, they feel great right out of the box and last a long time. They aren't as cushioned as some shoes (as I'm 60 I appreciate cushioning), but I find that the cushy shoes just aren't good for walking."
20636,1,"These sandals feel really soft & comfortable. I have high arches and the contoured arch support work real well. With traditional ""flat"" sandals, I tend to suffer from plantar fasciatis, especially if I walk on them for most of the day. I love these sandals!"
358988,0,"Good shoe. Wore them to and from the shower while in iraq. My only issue with them is that they rubbed my toes badly. It was probably because my feet were wet. It got so bad I stopped wearing them, but that was the only issue I had with them. Overall a very sturdy shoe."
297464,1,"From the first time I saw these shoes I knew I had to have them. They are very stylish, go great with jeans, and are extremely comfortable. Also didn't hurt that I was able to get them for about $35 less at Amazon than anywhere else was selling them for if they even had them. My new favorite pair of shoes."
357798,0,"I bought these for tap shoes for my daughter. Shoes are good quality did not realize in the fine print, TAPS NOT INCLUDED. Could have bought shoes for less else where with taps."
231075,1,"They are wonderful - he said it just takes a while to break them in to your own specific feet. They hurt the first few days, but loves them now. They were a gift to my son."
33252,1,"I have worn Easy Spirit shoes for many years and find them comfortable and durable. I have had ongoing back problems, and find these shoes to help lessen back pain."
316852,1,"This is not my first pair of the M109 New Balance shoe. I usually have 2 at a time. One for tennis and one for walking. When the tennis pair begin to wear out, I buy a new pair for walking. I prefer its all-white look and the comfort is great."
142601,1,"Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either.I originally got the Crocs for temporary use but now I look forward to slipping into them everyday when I get home. It's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step. They've replaced my slippers, mocassins, surf shoes and sandals."
141450,1,"I was extremely satisfied with the service on this purchase. I received the item at the front-end of the timeframe when it was expected to be delivered. If that wasn't the case, I would not have had the sandals in time for my beach vacation!"
71892,0,"I loved these shoes, but my boyfiend hates them. They are very comfortable and go with many things, but they did my feet smell too. I had to put the foot odor powder in them at least once every 3 or 4 wears and I had to wash them frequently. I wanted to buy a pair in black, but my boyfriend wouldn't let me."
366263,1,"I bought these after realizing my worn out Merrel sandals were no longer built...I'm not Keen fan, and I still think they look a little funny. But, they fit well,seem well made, and they feel great. I've worn them to work for a week, andwalked 5 miles around NYC and I am still happy.I think my proper size is a 9.5, and I heard these ran big, so I ordered a10, and that seems right. I kind of have to work to get them on, and I don'tslide around in them. The elastic lace seems to do little. I imaginethey will stretch out a little (not too much I hope) and the lacewill be useful."
278156,1,I am from New Zealand and buying this shoe all the way from USA was an extreme decision. I got this shoe in June 2011. I have been using it for the last few months and the following points are worth mentioning.1. Great balance and fit. though initially a bit tight and takes a bit of wearing for proper fit which is quite natural for leather.2. wear at the back heel at minimum which is a common problem for me and in some cases shoes may almost wear out in a month. (I walk to my work and return with is about daily 5kms)3. They are really waterproof! Not a even any moistness inside! Just wonderful4. Elegant and good looking!5. Worth the money spend including the $25 shipping! Will buy again the same brand and product!
382784,1,"I bought these sneakers for my Mom and she absolutely loves them for their comfort and neat, clean appearance. I should note they seem to run a bit small as I had to return the first pair in her size and reorder a pair a half size up, which were perfect."
347080,1,"This shoe has been the best! My foot is very narrow and it fits me fine, my heel feels very secure. Also the roominess in the toes is great because I have a bone spur problem in my toe and most shoes really hurt it. I am very excited to have found these."
122580,1,"Don't know why Converse can't ship their high top sneakers with long enough laces, but the 63 inch laces are the perfect replacement pair. Also passed the teen boy standard as he said they were similar to the original's quality."
366053,1,"Just what you would expect if you owned a pair of these 10, 20, 30 years ago, except with a custom peace sign logo on the outside only.They do sure highlight however just how far shoe technology has come by comparison to a pair of ASICS running shoes - in terms of support, comfort etc. They are 30 year old or more shoe technology.I hoped that logo would be on both sides but the inseam side of the shoe bears the traditional converse chuck taylor logo.Still, 5 stars from my view. They are what they are supposed to be."
273513,1,"I have worn TEVA's for years. I have a high arch, but love wearing zorries and the arch construction in TEVA's works well for me.Love the MUSH ""slippers"". I live in Hawaii and also live in zorries, so I have quite a closet full of various colors. They are comfortable from the get-go and form to your foot after a few wearings. Give you a little bit more long range comfort because of the extra padding.One warning: They tend to squish out a bit eventually and the shoe starts looking slightly too large on your feet, so I've started to buy 6's instead of 7's (they only come in whole sizes regrettably) and just live with the fact that my feet are just fitting the shoe as I hate it when the rubber begins to spread out and then they look sloppy on my feet.The MUSH tends to be cut about 1/4 inch shorter than the new Toolani style (sadly replaced the old Ulani style), so keep this in mind when ordering for fit. I am right in between a 6 and 7, but going smaller works for me.Otherwise, adore these zorries."
174498,1,"This is the first time that I'm reviewing something that I didn't purchase on Amazon. I had them on my wishlist and was going to get them for my daughter, but found them in a store first. Thank goodness because I would have gotten the wrong size for sure. I ended up getting size 3 toddler which leaves a little wiggle room in the toe area. She actually is a 4.5. A week before I purchased a pair of shoes at Stride Rite and was told to get size 5, which gives her a little room to grow. So, just keep that in mind. There is about a 1 1/2 size difference. That being said, these are so cute and my daughter wears them and walks in them with no problem. LOOOVE these boots!"
98334,1,I have bought these shoes for a while now. I work on my feet 10 hours a day as a Front Desk Manager and need comfybut dressy shoes. I always keep a black and a brown pair on hand and they last at least one to two years. I never had any tear up just wore down the soles from use over time. Love these shoes!
125100,1,These are one of the most comfortable dress shoes I have ever worn. I normally wear tennis shoes being a nurse and so I know what is comfortable. I bought these softspots after buying two pairs of shoes that were just so uncomfortable and produced blisters. Now I am not going to dread wearing dress shoes and now make them my go to shoes.SoftSpots Women's Stephanie Pumps
7809,1,"The price was right, appreciated free shipping... received the product 10 days after the suggested delivery... purchased for a gift, and it arrived the day I needed it... was worried it would not arrive"
254936,1,Good design. Good color. Nice autumn shoes matching well with any pants. Also the price was very reasonable. I am perfectly satisfied:)
115518,1,would recommend anyone who wants a comfortable and stylish shoe. wore sauconys in high school and I love them then and I love them now. only thing is they run a half size small.. so if u wear a 9... buy a 9.5 for a better fit.
230766,1,"Good buy! A little pricey though compared to those at the outlets, but nevertheless a pair of very high quality shoes."
292394,1,"The Best Shoe Ever! I have been buying this same shoe for at least 10 years,because I'm on my feet all day and it's like walking on a cloud. I only wish that they came in a brown color."
288398,0,"Just bought and returned these. They are a lot shinier than they look in the picture. Much more appropriate for formal wear, not for business casual."
141129,0,"I bought my son a pair of Dada Supremes and he loves them. Unfortunately, the shoe strings are not well made and they broke within the first 2 weeks.Second, I was very disappointed in the amount of time for shipping. It took nearly 3.5 weeks to arrive in South Carolina.My son loves the shoes, but the strings and the shipping are not well done."
254007,1,"The shoes looks good and are well made, I know how young people like to stay in style and they arrived well in the time frame given."
68356,1,"This shoe is so cute and sooo comfortable. I was able to adjust the sling to customize the fit, and the leather is very pliable, not digging into my foot anywhere. I have wide feet, so digging is a regular part of my life when it comes to sandals or anything with a heel, even if I order wide. Naturalizer is great. If you get the right size, their shoes are comfortable AND pretty."

87223,0,I have worn out my 13EEE Dunham sandals and decided to buy the less expensive Propet 13 EEE but they were much shorter than the Dunham 13 EEE so I returned them and ordered the more expensive Dunham sandal.
168571,0,THESE ARE NICE AND SPACIOUS BOOTS AND THE BURGANDY IS A HARD COLOR TO FIND BUT MY GOD THEY COME WITH NO INTERIOR CUSHIONING SO BEWARE.....IT TOOK 2 SETS OF INNER CUSHIONS TO RENDER THESE WEARABLE. IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE COLOR THEY WOULD HAVE GONE RIGHT BACK.THEY ARE DRESSY ENOUGH FOR WORK ON IN CLEMENT DAYS BUT THAT HARD FOOT BASE ALMOST GOT THESE A 1 STAR RATING.
130702,1,"Just got a pair of these. I always wear street size 11, but based on other reviews I ordered size 11 1/2. These fit well, a little tight, but that should go away as they break in.So far seem to be well made."
188283,1,"just in time and just what i needed. This are just like the first reebok shoes i got as a little kid. Light, confortable. They also fit just perfect. Strongly recomend this product."
361013,1,"Amazing shoes! love the color, the details,everything, but they run small, had to re-order a full size larger. But overall, great quality, everything!"
50205,1,"Love these boots. They look sexy! Only thing is they fit a little small. Im a 7 1/2 and i got a 8. I wish i got a 9 because they leave marks on my foot from long time use of wearing them. Otherwise, they are amazing."
243105,1,buy these shoes because they were very comfortable lei really are beautiful but sometimes I use are cute very pleased with this purchase.
105756,1,"I purchased these shoes for my boyfriend because we couldn't find any large enough for his feet in stores. He loves them and wears them all the time! The only thing I might change about my purchase is the shipping. We had to have them by a specific date and yes they were here on time, it was nerve racking wondering if the standard ship would be sufficient. Overall excellent purchase!"
277674,0,"I really wanted to like these boots, because they feel solid and comfy, but they were too small around the toes - side to side. I usually wear a 7W, so I got both 7W and 7.5W, and both were to small across the toe. I may try 8W."
11761,1,This is a perfect sandal for dress or casual. I needed a navy pair to wear when I am working conferences and these are great. They are comfortable and look very neat with dresses or suits.
363957,1,These shoes are a total classic. My son wanted these because they're the same ones David Tenant wears in Dr. Who. Now I need to order another pair because he wears them exclusively. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a stylish and comfortable everyday shoe.
149755,1,"Shoes are great. 15 minutes after I ordered the shoes (literally) they went on sale, $5 less. I could not change my order. I would have to wait until I received them then return them. Disappointed."
58438,1,I love my new Keds sneakers. I have lots of colors to wear with different outfits to work. Getting ready to order acouple more pairs. I recommend using Amazon highly! Never have had a problem with them.
389629,1,"I own 5 pairs of Converse sneaks, my daughter has 3 pairs, and my son has 2 pairs. We all really love our Chucks. But this is my first pair of the low top kind. I love them so much. They are really comfortable and easy to slip on and off, and so very black so they go with any kind of casual clothing well.If you're buying Converse for the first time, be aware they run just a touch big. This is wonderful for my son who has fairly wide feet, but the rest of us usually buy a half size small."
155448,1,"I bought a pair of these at Foley's (now Macy's) in Houston about 2 years ago. I loved these shoes so much, I went to buy another one; however, as Macy's bought out Foley's (a Mays company store), they took it off the shelf. A few searches online via Google and Amazon.com had them. I ordered it as soon as I saw it. It arrived two days later at my door and began to wear it. Like any other new shoes, you will get blisters, so don't forget to double up on your socks for the weeks. After that, it's straight coasting. They're really comfortable and the leather is great. The sole is also tough. On my first pair, the soles went out on me but that's because I walked on gravel and stones for a whole week everyday. The stones and gravel eventually softened it but for street walking and carpet, it's great because you don't slip, or slide and stick on carpet. So, it's really ideal. Also, it's great for dancing :)I hope this review helps. Cheers mates.Collin112"
99467,1,"I like these shoes for the durability, how easy they are to get into,alsothe arch support is perfect for me. I love this handsome shoe....if I could, I'd buy one in every color! PLUS....you can wash it!"
143801,0,"I gave these shoes three stars because they are comfortable and good for just walking around. However, I would not ever do anything that involves running or jumping in these shoes. The aharp edge on the bottoms make it difficult to land safely. I've sprained my ankles three times in these shoes playing volleyball (went up for spike, came down with the worst sprain I've ever had), basketball (sprained while trying to cut while running; foot sideways and my ankle gave), and once just walking (walking along a sidewalk, I stepped on a tiny pebble. my foot went sideways, and the edge of the bottom cause my ankle to go out instead of helping my foot go flat. minor roll, could've sprained). I'm prone to sprains, but I've never had this many issues with any shoe before. Here's hoping it doesn't happen to someone else, though I'm sure it has."
1398,1,it is very very good soft end comfortable. I recommend this boots all from work end they are always reliable
211574,1,Received the product in great shape and it was exactly what I ordered but I thought that the delivery was a little slow.Merry Christmas
15216,1,I purchased these boots in september for the hunting season. I have recently purchased another pair for my father I liked them so much.
98661,0,"size was not true to us sizing,so a send back and reorder was required."
221385,1,"Once she can get them on. The left boot is a bit difficult, but time will probably straighten that out. I took off a star for that issue, but five stars otherwise especially with regard to fit and finish."
172073,1,"I'm pretty picky when it comes to buying a shoes. Typically, Adidas seem to fit my feet very nicely. These Clutch's are no exeception. They are very comfortable and supportive featuring the a3 torsion control technology. The Black/Lead leather and stitching look sweet. I mainly use them on the court and innitially found that they are a tiny bit heavier than my old B-Ball shoes. This took a couple days to get use to but the added support that they provide make it worth it--especiallly for one whose knees and ankles are more prone to injury than they used to be.These shoes are very durable with nylon stitching along the toe and full leather upper, I expect them to last a long time.The one thing that would make the shoe better is more ventilation. There are only three ventilation holes on the top of the toe and then most of the other ventilation comes from the seams. Gamers might particularly take note of this.However, for the price, this is a killer shoe--Don't Pass'em Up!"
26940,1,This is the third pair of these shoes I have bought. All different colors. They are great to wear in the office in the summer.
312947,1,"Well made, comfortable, durable, water proof... Crocs are very versitile shoes and are great for water sports, beach wear, cleaning, rainy days, or just lounging around the house!"
303181,1,Love these shoes!!!! They are perfect with dress pants for work and perfect with jeans. What more could you want. Slipped them on - a perfect fit and wore them all day. Delivery was fantastic. Thanks Amazon.
231591,0,"Usually my feet stray off of flip-flops toward the inside, but the pretty and plentiful straps on these Tevas keep my feet in the correct place. They're also extremely comfortable - nice and squishy. Unfortunately, they also turn the bottoms of my feet BLACK and the discoloration doesn't come off easily - it takes some scrubbing with soap and a washcloth. These flip-flops would get 5 stars if it weren't for that."
282706,1,The product was great and they arrive in time for the trip to Africa.Thank you
23977,1,They are comfortable from the moment I put them on. Someone already told me that they know I'm an alcoholic when I have bottle openers in my sandals. I'm not but it was a pretty darn funny conversation at the 4th of July BBQ! The bottle opener works great and is really convenient.
350475,1,"I have always liked Puma shoes and these are extraordinary. Really comfortable, but I would get a half size to a size larger than you might for another brand of shoe (especially if you have wide duck feet like me). This style in all black is subdued enough that I can even get away with wearing it as a dress shoe at work."
287982,0,"The sandals were exactly the model I wanted except that unfortunately they are a bit too wide for my feet. Probably I did not make sure that they come in different width, but as iI am back in Argentina there was not much I could do. In any case I probably might have to give them away!! Thanks anyway!!"
83794,1,"I know Reef flip-flops are insanely comfortable so that was no surprise. They arrived on time and look super cute. The only bad thing I have to say is that the size must be a little small. I wear 6 in most shoes and my feet usually fit fine, but my foot fits just perfectly on these and I'd rather have a little bit of room on my flip-flops. Granted, the last flip-flops I wore were an entire size bigger so I might just be used to wearing a larger size. It doesn't create a big problem, it was just a little strange when I first wore it.All in all these are great simple flip-flops."

330724,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
293555,1,"excellent product very comfortable shoes highly recommended very happy with it, I bought one for me and one for my mom."
207858,1,The air soles and support (I put inserts under the pad) have ended by back pain. I purchased a second pair as a spare.
75813,1,I bought these after searching for wide taps shoes for my daughter. She loves them! They are easy for her to put on and take off by herself. She says they are more comfortable than any other tap shoe she has had.
373506,1,"Absolutely beautiful boot and can't wait to wear them. We don't have a lot of cold weather in Houston but I always wear my boots as often as I can. Sorry I can't write about how they feel yet but being Rockport, I doubt I will be disappointed."
8133,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had. The only bad thing i have found is the price difference between youth and large. $20.00 more for a bigger size is rediculous, but other than that they are really cool shoes especially how you can personalize them with your teams colors and your team name, your name, and your number. Some of the reasons they are really good shoes are because they are comfortable, have good traction, and just look good."
257397,2,The shoes arrived quickly. Unfortunately the shoes must have been seconds. Not only are they not narrow on the right shoe the one strap was sewn on incorrectly.
197794,1,"From the past to the present Converses have always been in style. These classic shoes are all over America today. Why are they so popular? Probably because they've stayed the same over the years. Any type of person can wear these trendy shoes, and a good thing is, they last incredibly long. I recommend these shoes to babies all the way up to adults!"
189165,0,"I used these for my wedding.I wore them for about 4 hours and they were comfortable until the end, they started to hurt a bit. But definitely good for several hours! I added a gel pad prior to the wedding, because due to the height the ball of the foot can tend to hurt. Also, these shoes tend to run narrow, so buy a larger size than your average size. The bottom of the heel and the front part of the foot are very flat. I didn't try to dance in these because of the height. Overall they add the needed height, and are very secure (unlike the average ""stripper"" shoe). One bad thing about these shoes are they tend to scuff easily. This won't be noticed by everyone else, but you may notice the scuffs yourself."
255221,1,"These little shoes are so cute and sturdy. My daughter was born with a club foot and has had it corrected, but still her foot turns in a little. These are very good for her little foot. They match anything! That's what I love about them. People have already told me that they are so cute, too, and have asked me where I got them!"
250756,1,"These shoes are great, not too narrow, just wide enough for my feet, plus the cushions are good and its light. One of my favorite basketball shoes."
26420,1,Being a Santa these shoes ar GREAT! They take me back to my childhood and what I do now. How fun. I get so many complaments.Thanks so much for making such a great product.
63817,1,These are classic black gym shoes. We needed plain black gym shoes for the school play. These shoes were perfect.
222759,1,"These are very nice slippers, warm and comfy. The size 2E width is an accurate measurement. I have wide feet so I'm always dealing with the width issue. These slippers are definitely 2E but not 3E or 4E. Hope that helps for those like myself who are always on the lookout for wide shoes."
193803,1,"These are the only Brand of Sandals I can buy and be guaranteed to be able to wear without taking time to ""break them in."" They are comfortable for walking and very nice looking to wear."
305590,1,"This was a gift for my father on fathers day. He tells me they are very comfortable. So I guess according to him, these are very good sneakers."
26860,1,I am a professional that has responsibilities over a few transporation operations...walking them to check things out is a big distance to cover and I needed a decent looking professional YET VERY comfortable cushioned pair of shoes that would get me through the day without my feet hurting and being very swollen. I am happy with my Clark's...they do the job!! I just wish I would have known or run into them many years ago. Thanks!
72887,1,The product was in excellent shape. Size did not fit daughter. Reordering. Thank you for great services.
43782,1,I bought the white ones for work as a nurse. They were a little tight across the top of my foot for a few days but now are so comfortable. I love them.
134735,0,"This product fits way too big! I was disappointed by the lack of information about fitting. However, the product shipped fast. Just keep in mind that you should buy this product a size smaller"
82279,1,"THIS PAIR WAS A BIT LARGER THAN WHAT I LIKE, GAVE THEM TO MY SISTER-IN-LAW MY BAD AS THE KIDS USED TO SAY. LOVED THE COLOR AND THE PRICE, WISH I HAD GOTTEN A SIZE SMALLER."
155800,1,Love these shoes. Not only are they comfortable but look good on your feet. Shipping was quick. I am very satisfied with this product.
241742,1,This shoe is so comfortable and got to be one of the best running and basketball shoe. Plus your getting official Iverson shoes!Great shoe!
58961,1,Just got my second pair of these for Christmas and I absolutely love them. They are very comfortable and I would recommend these to anyone!
187684,0,"I wound up ordering the medium size. I sent this one back because it was too big for me. I love the print, and the color, but it was just the wrong size."
280056,1,"These slides are so cool that the moment I received them, my daughter grabbed them and went off on Spring Break to Acapulco with them. I had to order another pair! They are as comfortable as can be and so pretty, and I get compliments whenever I wear them."
173880,1,"I have another pair of these shoes and loved them; therefore, I purchased the pair through Amazon at a good price."
173640,1,THese sandals met all my expectations. I purchased these for my mother-in-law who had worn out this exact style of shoe. She had not been able to find them in a store and was thrilled to have them replaced.
386089,1,"Man when I walk around in these, I look so fresh and so clean I have to beat the ladies off me! Half might be the shoes half might be my incredibly large shlong!"
92598,0,good looking and well madebut ...so hard to walk withfeel like wood not leather
266606,1,"I am not an outdoor person nor a hiker. I work in IT and often walk a lot. I had the normal work shoes, even a pair of Dr. Schols. My feet around the balls of my feet HURT. It was to the point i was going to see a doctor as I felt like an old man. I decided to try these boots since all my walking was like hiking. This was more then I ever spent on a pair of shoes, but that pain was just too much. I began wearing these shoes and within a week I could feel the pain in feet going away. Now I am pain free and I wear the boots EVERYWHERE. Money well spent."
241423,1,I bought these for the sole purpose of weightlifting. Excellent ankle support and flat bottoms without much heel make these an ideal shoe in the gym. These shoes provide very firm footing and i would highly recommend them to bodybuilders on a budget.
27554,1,I work on my feet all day and needed a comfortable attractive show. I usually wear Danskos and wanted to try something new. These were perfect. I absolutely love them they are very comfortable. Broke in nicely.
99821,1,"After 10 years and literally wearing through the rubber, cork, and leather on the heels of my previous pair, I'm back for more. I only wish new pairs broke in faster. Great shoe that will last you a long time. Might not win you any fashion trend awards but they look fine and feel great."
274422,1,I've always loved the Hi-Tec Altitude boots. This will be my third pair of them. They were only replaced due to the wear and tear on them through the years I've had them.
355577,1,"Dada's are some of the best basketball shoes i have ever had.

197790,1,I get so many compliments on my chuck taylors' they bring back the good old days and so comfortable!! I wore these when I was a kid!!
144798,1,"Researched several different types of boots. Read countless reviews. Followed recommendations regarding color and size. Appreciate everyone who types an opinion, it really helps! Boots are fantastic!"
233028,0,Just arrived and best described as a slipper.No separate insole or structure. The soles are very narrow so the upper in the D width must hang over the edge. I have been wearing deerskin moccasins for 50 years or so. The quality seems to be going downhill.
339228,1,This was a Christmas present for my son. He loves and wears Chuck Taylor All Star OX shoes. He has several pairs.
173328,1,This product was purchased for my mother-in-law who has poor circulation in her feet and has to be very careful to have shoes that do not constrict the blood flow or cause any blisters or sores. These shoes have been great for her. She has them in several colors.
294095,1,"These mocs are comfy and sturdy enough to wear to work every day -- I work retail, so I'm on my feet for about 7-8 hours a day. I have to wear arch-support inserts with them, but I do that with every shoe I own. I would buy these mocs again."
15628,1,No problems and no complaints. My order was fine and the converses were excellent.
190456,1,Not many shoe companies bother to make different widths. That's amazing considering that millions live in this country alone and they can't all have the same feet width. The extra width means I no longer get corns and blisters. Plus the show is very good. I'm stuck on New Balance.
357954,1,"I use a 10 1/2 W, 1/2 a size bigger than I wear for a sneaker, in this shoe. The heel is comfortable, and I can stand or dance in these for hours with no problem. They are also fine with slacks for a regular day."
367652,2,"I ordered size 10 and I couldn't get my feet into them. I would suggest that if you have swelled or just large feet that you order a higher size. Because there is no elastic, the top of the shoes just doesn't have any give at all. The shoes were long enough for me but just couldn't wear them. My feet aren't all that big either."
181885,1,"These shoes are good looking. They hold up very well to scuffs and wear. The only problem I have with them is that the front of the shoe isn't very tall, so if you have big toes/fat feet, it's going to cause some mild pain by the end of the day. It's not anything you'd notice if you were just wearing the shoes for a couple hours."
232548,1,"Very comfortable shoe at a good price. I hope Dockers doesn't stop making this shoe, as I've been through several pairs over the years."
180604,1,"I bought these shoes for my husband/son on a Saturday and they were delivered to my house on the following Tuesday. Super, fast delivery I really like the colors they have in these shoes, they are in a cute style, the quality is good,and the price is great."
69538,0,"I am a Croc addict. There, I said it. BEWARE!!!! Crocs Classic and Crocs Beach have completely different sizing. I wear a W9 in Classic and they all fit like a dream. The same in Beach looks like duck shoes. Huge. These shoes in yellow were not available at this time in the Classic style, so I took a leap. The wrong one. The shoes were returned and my credit was issued immediately. No problem with the shoe or seller, it wasmy fault, but the sizing needs to be standard across all sizes. As far as the transaction with this seller, it gets 5 stars. Crocs themselve get the 3 stars. Will still buy more though!"
219152,1,"Rockport shoe is a favorite of mine. A very comfortable shoe. Only one complaint, that is the velcrow strap at the heel catches on to my socks or stockings. A better way would be just the leather strap with some elasticity to it. Still a favorite brand of mine."
211111,0,"I found the quality very poor - although I am a bit surprised as its Nine west. Well, The shoe is very cute looking"
195226,1,Brought these for my mother and she stated that these were the most comfortable pair of sandals she owns. I would recommend these as good buy as it is very difficult to find wide width shoes
358320,1,"The shoes do run small so I ordered one size up based on previous reviews. My feet are wide at the toes so I stretched them overnight and now they fit and feel great. My feet hurt after 12 hr nursing shifts with special shoes, but I can square dance in these for hours and feel fine. Almost wish I could wear them to work!"
274517,1,"Bought these boots to replace a pair of New Balance boots at twice the price that didn't hold up. These boots are easily more comfortable and are better built. Even though my current pair are still in great shape, I'm tempted to buy another pair in case they become discontinued."
340911,1,These are nice and soft slippers but they are very large around the they were much to short for the given size. I kept them only because I knew they would stretch a bit and have but still to short which is sad. I do not like slippers with rubber or synthetic soles for our doors and these are soft leather which is why I bought them.
353435,1,"Great shoe in the style of the old Adidas ROM from when I was a kid. They look great and are very comfortable. If you like this style, check out the Country II style also. I like them so much I bought a total of 4 pairs of the Italia and Country 2."
383354,1,"I really like this shoe! It's hard for me to find a shoe as narrow as I need, but this one fits just right across the toes and on the heel. It's a little wide at the instep, but I can definitely live with it. I was a little dissappointed to find there is no arch support. I think if there were a support, the wideness would disappear."
283724,0,"This shoe is aesthetically superior to anything on the market, particularly the latest version, a unrivaled gem which sports a navy blue faux-suede. If you don't actually want to PLAY basketball in these, definitely get a pair.However, if you're using the shoe for its intended purpose, I hope you have narrow feet and strong ankles. As a huge fan of the original T-Macs (didn't get the T-Mac 2's because they were too narrow), I was hoping that the 3's would restore my faith in the shoe. I'm a serious baller - I play just about every day and participate in 3 corporate/city leagues.That being said, after only owning these shoes for just three few weeks, I had to return them because I sprained BOTH ankles (never happened with the T-Mac 1's) AND severely bruised my medial and plantar nerves (never happened in my life - ever). Though ankle injuries are all too common in basketball, these injuries did not occur in the typical &quot;landed on someone's foot&quot; fashion, which is cause for serious concern. I consulted my podiatrist on the issue and she informed me that my shoes provided poor support and suggested I look into a pair of New Balances.Additionally, the outside of the shoe will dig into your ankle if you lace your shoes up tightly, as there is no cushioning around the top rim of the shoe.Proceed with caution - do not be wowed by looks, particularly if you need support or have wider feet."
159168,1,"What else can you say about a sneaker that has been around for over 90 years. These sneakers are simply great!!! I got the classic black high top and am very pleased with them. They are comfortable, durable and stylish. On a hot summer day the don't heat up like a bread oven, like some sneakers do, keeping your feet cool and comfy. If they do get dirty or funky you can simply toss them into your washer and bada bing like new!!! They offer enough support for me to last for a long day of walking around town or work. One of the coolest things about these sneakers is that they offer a ""back at ya"" response to the more expensive and mostly ugly ""skater"" and basketball sneakers. A great sneaker at a great price. I love mine!!!"
157407,1,You should have heard the laugh of pure delight when my daughter got these. The quality and workmanship were perfect. My daughter wears these to school every day.
387894,0,"Couldn't find this color anywhere else, thankfully they had it. It was cheaper than the stores too, only bad thing is that the sizes are general so &#34;medium&#34; was big on me and i wear a women's 8."
324760,2,I ordered this shoe and wore them to work for a weekk I had to sens them back. I think there was an inherent design flaw. They were cutting into my ankles and causing sever pain. I could not wear them
117893,1,"First of all these shoes look awesome. I got them for about 22 dollars and they were perfect. Shipped on time and packaging was excellent. Also they are light and thin but they are meant to be so for running purposes. Also they are very very strong on the bottom as in their sole so they will hold up for awhile. Also I use them for running only every now and then and they look great enough to where you can wear them as sneakers. This is because the spikes on the bottom are removable, comes with a handy tool for it."
144696,1,"I have been wanting the women's classic UGG boots for awhile and I finally treated myself to them. I knew that I would be very satisfied with my purchas and indeed I am!These boots are very comfortable, affordable, and cute for everyday wear. I would highly recommend them and will be purchasing another pair very soon.A girl can never have too many shoes!!"
376322,1,"I bought them for my son and he's very happy with them. My son is playing tennis three days a week for the last month and you have to believe it, the shoes still look like new."
48741,1,"These came in the box, well wrapped, and are perfect! The fit feels great, and the balance is great, so walking in these heels is no trouble at all. (As it can be in boots that are of lower quality.)"
337648,1,"Converse All Stars, a classic. Love them. They're very comfortable and they're perfect for a night at the movies or just hanging out with the guys.Obviously they do not have much support or cushion (and I wasn't expecting any). If I was going to be on my feet all day or doing something real active this is not the shoe I would choose.Tilly's service was fantastic. I couldn't be more pleased."
44779,0,"I like the boots and got them at a reasonable price, but when they arrived I must admit I was a little disappointed at the quality. I love Charles David shoes and will spluge for the quality, but these seemed like knock offs and not the real thing."
149943,1,"I bought these boots and they are awesome. They are ankle boots and very comfortable. I would have given them five stars if they were waterproof. I've walked through snow in them, and after being waterproofed, were fine. The loop at the back to help you pull them on is a little flimsy. Don't yank on it you'll break it off- I did. The ankle straps really do hold your feet in place too. Overall, a good buy."
53969,0,"The Keds sneaker is a classic, same style as always, and worn by everyone. I was surprised, however, that they tend to run a little small! My foot is between 9.5 and 10 in size, so I bought 10, and I can't wear them with socks. I am trying to stretch them with shoe trees in hopes of being able to wear them more often. I have to say, that's a little disappointing."
351276,1,"I gave these to my Mom for Christmas, and she loves them. When she's not wearing shoes, she's wearing these slippers. She loves the fact that she can wear them outside and not worry about having to change into shoes, as traditional slippers can be ruined this way. They keep her feet warm, but not too warm, which is the big selling point for her with slippers."
237420,1,So happy with these quality shoes from Clark! They fit beautifully and are comfortable from Day 1. I like the detail touches across the instep as well. It's nice to have a shoe that looks good and feels even better.
242116,1,"Love these converse shoes.They are a great shade of red, have already got a lot of comments on them.Thanks Chuck!"
298117,0,"When I was a young girl back in the 80's, I remember my Grandmother and my Great-Aunts raving about how comfy these shoes were. They wore these suckers every single day. I saw them here and thought, ""Oh, these will be cool for putzing around the house..."". I bought them in black and a size 10M. I got them in the mail, tried them on and they were too short AND too narrow (which is rare for me). I returned them and got another pair in a size 11W and they are still too crowded in the toes. I thought if I wore them for a while, they would stretch out, but they still rub me raw on the tops of my toes. I guess all I can say about these is that shoes have come a long way since Daniel Green starting making the Boca."
66570,1,These may be the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. I ordered them in natural and they go with just about everything.They are very casual and not what I would call fashionable but great for every day running around. They are true to size.
329775,1,good morningthe excellence of the purchase is that I arrive in the estimated time and are products that people want to buy is a great way to buy cards by providing this optionto shop and provide good service and hope to continue buying the best of you waiting felicitacciones
193489,1,Perfect and great price! Perfect and great price! Perfect and great price! Perfect for Charter school requirements and a great price!
160828,2,"Watch out for selecting the converse black shoe, it displays a low top but may in fact be a hi top, be sure in the cart."
361567,0,"I like them, however, the fit is a little big. The draw back is they only come in whole sizes and I find they run wide also."
9526,1,"These shoes were bought and used for a hiking trip to the Grand Canyon and Sedona. They came through with flying colors. This semi-couch potato hiked several miles a day and came home without a single blister. In fact, I liked them so much that I wore them the entire vacation including out to dinner eventhough they had some mud caked on them (my traveling companions weren't thrilled about this, however)."
42357,1,"I am delighted with this product. previously bought addias trainers,but found these are lite, hard wearing and very comfortable . After numeruous training sessions with senior and junior teams this lad on a underage team that my son plays with commented "" Your Dad has the coolest BBall boots out their "" . which made me feel 7 ft tall for a small man. EXCELLLANT PRODUCT."
58750,2,"I was so disappointed with these shoes. In fact, I returned them. The quality is not that of the Ked's that I grew up wearing!"
158739,1,"I was fitted for a pair of these at a speciality running store and purchased them with a gift card for over $100. I jog/walked a marathon in these a few months ago and they were great--no blisters, no nothing. I would definately purchase these shoes again, especially at the prices offered by Amazon!!!!"
200529,1,"The convenience of not tieing them is great. I have two pairs; 1 that I take into the elements and fishing, boating, etc. and another pair that I just use for when I go casual. I love not having to tie them or worry about them getting wet, drying out , etc. The key is just not to leave them backed away or in the dark while they are wet, so they do not mold, etc... I highly recommend these for comfort, durability, ease."
26231,1,My husband has been wearing this exact shoe for years...we are sad that it appears to be discontinued and that finding a suitable replacement in his size ( 15 US ) is nearly impossible!For NB 991 lovers...get 'em while you still can! Reviews we've read on the replacement aren't very good!
316306,1,"You can't bet Minnetonka shoes for comfort... the company has been well known forever for this! Also, this color (sort of a muted blue/gray) goes so well with jeans, too!"
58700,0,"The Keds sneaker is a classic, same style as always, and worn by everyone. I was surprised, however, that they tend to run a little small!

56157,1,These sneakers are very comfortable and I am very pleased with the look and price. I would highly recommend for a casual flat everyday shoe.

148595,2,"I have purchased online through Fogdog in the past; however, the description on Amazon is incorrect. This is NOT a 3 pair pack, it is only one pair of socks for $13.99 plus shipping. What a rip-off. I am deeply disappointed.Pro Feet Mens Acrylic Multi-Sport Tube Sock - 3 Pair Pack"
97399,1,I wear this shoe almost every day in the summer. They are so comfortable. I've even worn them in New York City while visiting there last summer. It's my favorite flip flop ever.
324125,0,"I should have ordered this as a size 12 or 11 1/2 if available but I still likeed the shoe and still have them for around the house lounging around but not good for any strenuous sport because of snug because of size, not the shoe."
238687,1,"I like the quality feel of the product. Metal and wood. It seems as though it will hold up although the crank back down (once it's expanded) doesn't seem as definitive as it was during the first couple of uses. The little toe bumps are adjustable although can be a bit of a chore to get off and on- watch your nails! It has worked in open toe and closed toe shoes; both relatively flat and high heels. I even put them in pointy shoes and although they did not go all the way to the end, they were fine where I needed (in the mid forefoot). I wanted to try one out before getting another and based on my results I am ordering a second so I can stretch out both shoes in a pair at the same time. FYI, I do not use liquid spray stretcher."
7010,1,"These boots are very comfy and warm, and they look very good. However, a few tiny details were off when they arrived.First, one of the boots had some big, very noticeable brown rubber strings (like cut rubber bands) hanging out near the actual drawstrings. I couldn't figure out what purpose they served, and when I pulled very gently on one to see what it was even attached to, it came right off. I'm assuming they weren't meant to be there as the other strings did the same and the other boot didn't even have them.Also, the edge of the fabric on the inside bottom of the boot, between your foot and the actual rubber sole, comes detached VERY easily, and though it doesn't make the boot look any different from the outside, it can be uncomfortable to walk on at times. The first time I wore the boots this fabric was already coming up in one boot - I've worn them a couple of times now and it's coming up in both boots. If I wasn't worried about the damage it might cause, I would rip this fabric completely out just so I wouldn't feel the unevenness where the edges have ripped up.The drawstrings untie themselves very easily and are very long, so they can get in the way of walking or drag on the floor unless you triple-knot them.Overall, they look very good and I'm still happy I bought them - they just have a few minor details I'd change."
279352,1,"I've never seen such a great selection of Chuck Taylor High Tops. I think this is my 5th pair. They have such great designs, nothing you would ever find in a department store. The shipping is always fast and my order has always been correct. I highly recommend this vendor!"
165415,1,"This is a great shoe for me. It is light weight yet supportive. It looks dressier than I expected, which I am very pleased about."
303841,1,"I would have given 5 but I have been buyer these for a long time and I feel the quality is falling just a bit. If a manufacturer in the US would make something as comfortable and as nice looking, I love this style I would buy them as I really hate the fact they are made in China."
330048,1,"THESE BOOTS ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. THEY ARE COMFORTABLE IN EVERY WAY, AND PERFECT ON THOSE COLD WINTER DAYS TO WEAR TO WORK OR ANYWHERE. THEY SEEM TO RUN TRUE TO SIZE. IT IS ALMOST LIKE NOT HAVING ANY SHOES ON! THE LEATHER IS SO SOFT AND BUTTERY. I GET A LOT OF COMPLIMENTS ON THEM. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THESE."
222091,0,"Shoe looks great and is made out of real soft leather. I have the espresso color and it goes with most of my clothes (jeans, skirts) It has non-skid soles which is great since the heels are dangerously high. The inner sole is padded and covered with suede-like material, great for days when you're walking a lot. Not so great is the buckle-design on the straps. It rubs against your little toe when you move. It's not really that noticeable unless you've been wearing them for a while and you're prone to feet blisters which I am."

377682,1,"I was a little skeptical at first given the cost. But, I have to say that I am fully converted. Break-in was almost negligible. I have been through Ireland, France and climbed the Pyrenees in Spain with these boots. They still look new. Great Vibram tread and my feet stay warm and dry. Laces up easy. They fit a bit narrow compared to other boots I have. My size was a 1/2 size smaller than regular shoes. Takes on a nice shine that looks like glass. These are my favourite duty boot for work. Highly recommended. You get what you pay for. Note: When choosing, make sure the particular model is made in the USA. There is a difference."
322429,1,"lots of comments about size ...so much so that i anticipated having to send them back.here's my advice - don't use the size charts listed because its way off. Do this:get a tape measure - stand on it, measure from the bottom rear of your foot up to the tip of your big toe...then match that with the size next to it... (skip all the US/ EU / GB size... they are clearly wrong on the size listing)So, my daughters measurement was 10"" from back to tip - we ordered size 9. Perfect fit.okay, material quality is nice for wearing around the house or art school... but from what i could tell, it won't stand up to constant use. But hey, they're inexpensive (relatively speaking) so buy a few pair.m"

357383,0,"I had read that Keds was going back to its original quality rubber sole, but these have the same thin flappy soles that Keds have had for the last few years. The upper is also somewhat thin and scratchy, not like the original quality. I won't be fooled again."
78596,1,I couldn't purchase these anyplace in town and as usual you had them available for me! I got them in record time and ready to send off for a christmas gift.
149649,1,When I first put them on I was disappointed. They where tight andthey hurt my feet. I was going to send them back. After a fewdays they have broken in and they are great. Very solid andcomfortable. Glad I gave them a chance.
49864,1,"Shoes are nice and durable like only vans are, however this classics are very harsh on your feet the first couple weeks"
332049,0,"The product is well made and very comfortable. I bought it to wear at the health center swimming pool. It does get water in it that drips off my swimsuit. Then it squeaks when I walk. They are easily dried off and I can put them in my gym bag. Just wish they wouldn't squeak when wet. Other than that, I'm pleased with them."
107497,1,"These sandals were just what I was looking for. They were a little tight when they arrived, but have now stretched out just enough. These will be a favorite this summer."
280608,1,"I love these shoes. Very comfortable and feet my feet perfectly. Unlike some of the other reviews, these fit pretty much true to size for me, I'm glad I didn't order the next 1/2 size up. I think after the break in period, they will be perfect. I'm going to order a second pair."
366038,1,arrived in a timely matter and in great conditionpurchased it for a great price in comparison to other sellers
29042,0,"The mocs were beautiful, soft and supple, and didn't fit at all. With feet swollen from a recent accident, I thought they would be perfect for the times I actually have to wear shoes, and was crushed because they didn't fit. Other shoes, marked less wide, do. They made a wonderful gift for a loved one, who wears a narrower width, and she was ecstatic, but I was/am disappointed."
344192,1,"I always liked Converse shoes and since i moved to the Dominican Republic, i've gone thru my share of overpriced fakes. I'm happy that i can get these online now. I like having shoes that go along with any type of clothing or colour.....any!!!!So yes, these are great and one cannot go wrong in purchasing a pair unless u get the wrong size. I will definitely buy another or others in different colours. No regrets on this purchase."
150199,0,"These shoes were very comfortable, but made too much noise while walking. An air pocket formed and caused a sound with each step. I have poorly formed feet so it is probably more a problem with my feet than the shoes. I wish they didn't do that because they were so comfortable."
195327,0,"I bought this due to the many reviews here. Its got a cool form factor but it's not as soft and comfy as I expected. I tend to use my Crocs and Sanuk more, but honestly they don't look so cool."
265724,1,"These have been great boots. I am on my fourth pair of the Altitude series- a version I, version II, and now 2 version IVs. All have been good buys for me. The version IV have been the best but all have been good.First, I have a high arch and have always been hard on any footwear with a tendency to walk on the 'outside' of my foot. I wear these boots to travel in and work in while traveling. Many a mile in airports, many miles on concrete, gravel, dirt, and inside simulation facilities. When I travel I tend to only take these boots - my work rarely requires dress clothes, the boots look good in an open collar work environment, they are comfortable, and taking only 1 pair of shoes does cuts down on packing requirements quite a bit for longer trips (3 weeks or longer in duration).I have taken these boots on three overseas trips - they did well in the Scottish highlands (twice), and London. They did equally well on the beaches of Hawaii, Myrtle Beach, and Cancun. They have done me well in wet and sand - hot and cold.To add to this endorsement, not only am I hard on shoes I am also quite fat these days - topping 300 pounds. For my health I maintain a walking routine of 1-3 miles a day whenever possible. When I travel, these boots are also my walking shoes.In general Hi Tec have always fit me well. I go back 40 or so years to wearing the Lite series of Hi Tecs while I was in my running the Appalachians days. Given my high arches, a tendency for very bad calluses, rebuilt right ankle, 2 knees that varied doctors have wanted to cut on since early Army days, and now my weight I am very picky on shoes. These are the best of the Hi Tec boot types that I have found.I suspect I have seen the best of my current set of boots - maybe six more months or so of regular wear till they become yard work shoes till their final demise. I have never worn out the uppers in these boots. I have worn the sole down to a smooth surface and worn out the insides (after using new insole inserts a couple of times). They are tough boots.And I have a back up pair ready to take the place of the current set.On a down side, these style of boots (in general, not just Hi Tec) are not sturdy enough for doing squats in Power Lifting circles. One needs a higher and stiffer boot than what the modern ilk of hikers provides. This is the only limitation I have found for these boots."
87913,1,didnt have a problem with these they are exactly as you see them. the right color and true to size
95123,1,"For quick moving feet and an improved jump shot pick up the dunk-feast a3 adidas b-bal shoe, you will not find a better fit. Great support for lower ankles and arches. Over all great shoe"
384101,1,This is the third pair that I have purchased.Drew is a great company and their shoes are the best that I have ever had.
261648,1,"Great with jeans, great for fun and sport but mostly a universal staple in ones wardrobe man or woman! I would order them again and in every color of the rainbow. I am not thinking of the high tops and the other higher tie up ones."
324210,1,I love my sandals. They are the second pair I've bought. The first pair were clogs and I love them too. I wear my sandals all the time. I would reccomend them to anyone for themselves or as presents for others.
310472,2,"I had no problem with the quality of the shoe, my complaint is that the sizing was very confusing. I thought I was buying a pair of size 8 shoe for men or a size 6 for women, but it turned out the other way around. I have tor return these. You need to clarify the sizing of your shoes."
366124,1,"I bought this shoe as a supportive shoe for daily use rather than for trail running, to alleviate the pain in the heel known as plantar fasciitis. Such a shoe must have (1) a strong cupped back to keep the heel down and immobilized, (2) a rigid arch that will not bend or twist, and (3) a stiff toe, so that when walking the foot more rolls off the end of the shoe than bends. An orthotic (like Superfeet or Prothotic, etc.) is usually also recommended. The most recommended shoes seem to be the New Balance 926 and 845, but these are determinedly ugly; the 926s look like barges, and the more gracefully shaped 845s come only in a muddy black or a white, like nurses' shoes. The Montrail Hardrock is good looking and, less well-known, has the above supportive characteristics. (Columbia has since bought out Montrail, so I do know if the their recent version of the Hardrock offers the same support; some chatroom chatter suggests it does not.) I use a 3/4 length Birkenstock orthotic under the regular Hardrock footbed. I have experienced considerable relief wearing this shoe and orthotic, so I am quite pleased. (I use a 3/4 length orthotic with the Hardrock because it does not have the boaty toe of a New Balance, and a full-length orthotic will lift the toe too close to the top of the shoe. By the bye, I also get much added relief by the unlikely expedient of wrapping a single strip of 2"" duct tape around my arch--my bare foot not the shoe--with about a 1/8 inch gap in the tape on the bottom of the arch; I wear it under my sock by day and remove it at night for the skin to breathe and apply a new strip before putting weight on my foot next morning.) I hope the designers at New Balance come up with a less clunky more attractive shoe in the future, but for now I am very satisfied with my Hardrocks for the purpose, and I continue to look for appealing shoes with the above characteristics. Ciao"
27712,0,I'm giving this shoe 3 stars for one reason. The width runs too narrow. I have had a similar sizing problem in the past and that was with Reebok. Otherwise it is a very attractive and comfortable shoe that looks like it it will last for a long time.
183742,0,I purchased these in gold and they're very nice sandals but the strap between the toes hurt a lot. I've worn them several times and it hasn't gotten any better.
350861,1,"This shoe is highly breathable, light-weight, and sturdy. So far, they have withstood fairly regular walks on a reserve and a job that requires about 5 miles of walking per day for approximately 4 months. I have had back surgery in the past and these do well in not aggravating my back. I would definitely recommend these"
271136,1,"Fitting nicely on my B width feet with medium arches, these are extremely comfortable and the most ventilated court shoes I've ever worn. The ventilation screens that wrap around the bottom of shoe means your feet don't get hot and sweaty even when playing on hard courts on 95 degree days. Don't expect to wear them when it's wet outside or your feet will get drenched. Also love the bumpy laces as they never come undone during play. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that soles don't last as long as Goodyear soles on Prince QT2's did before they discontinued that shoe. However, I just ordered another pair of Glaciator's for this summer's tennis season."
225042,1,"Shoes arrived in original box; pristine condition; exactly what I ordered.HOwever, we ordered the wrong size. Return was handled well; account to be credited for purchase price only. No shoes in stock in the size we needed, and it would be spring before any more arrived. When you see your size, order it ASAP."

194594,1,"This is the third time I have purchased this shoe, it isso comfortable, my other shoes are jealous as they sit silently in the closet collecting dust. If you want a comfortable shoe, a good looking shoe, I recomment this one. And the price was right!"
72571,1,Everyone rants and raves when they see these boots and are totally astonished at the price as was I!

232032,0,"used to own a pair of these for a number of years until the sole split off of the upper. just bought these to replace them and ordered the same size i used to have. either my foot got bigger or they've changed the sizing. the soul seems very stiff and the toe-box feels narrow. my toe doesnt hit the end but they seem rather tight, even when loosely laced. hopefully they'll soften up with age and stretch to be as comfy as my last pair."
168822,1,"I have in-turned ankles and I use these shoes with my ankle supports. Not many shoes will enable me to walk in comfort with additional arch/ankle supports inserted in the shoes, but these will. It is comfort for both feet!Update May 15,2012: I bought the original pair in 2008, they are still good, albeit somewhat worn. I just purchased my second pair, and I retired the original pair for garden work only. I am pleased with both pairs of these shoes."
362465,1,These shoes were on a relative's wish list - bought a pair for her and liked them so much I bought a pair for me.
136066,1,"If you're into the retro stuff, this really is a great pair of sneakers. People forget how comfy they wear and despite what your friends may think, they do actually still look pretty good with almost any jeans/combats. Whether it's the hi-tops or this nifty pair, you just can't go wrong for $30."
228693,2,"The product itself was fine but because the item was the wrong size, I had to return for a credit or an exchange. It cost almost ten dollars to return the item after originally spending about six or seven dollars for shipping and handling. If I understand your policy, and you have the correct size and ship that, I will pay another six or seven dollars for shipping. That means for a purchase of about forty dollars, I have paid almost twenty four dollars extra. I would never purchase another clothing item from [...]."
125771,1,These are the most comfortable timberlands my husband has ever had....He loves and wants another pair for work he said its worth it!!
49821,1,"Very happy with the way they feel on my feet, there is some foot support and they look good on me aswell, I will continue to buy more vans in the future"
122311,1,"Pink laces were darker than the photo indicated--maybe 3 shades or so (could be my computer, could be something with the picture or the laces, hard to tell)."
301161,1,"My 6 yr old son really loves these boots and wants to wear them every day. He wanted ""work"" boots so he could be like his Daddy. Previously he had a pair of boots with a manmade upper and those did not last too long. He is very hard on footwear, but so far these seem to be holding up well. He even wears them to school on days he doesn't have gym."
330714,0,"When I'm serious about all day wear, I'll look for something better. The Justin line has been made in China for years and the so-called Basics I just bought are completely truthful in revealing that the upper and sole are manmade. That said, the vamp and upper both look good enough in the Bay Apache color. They have weird bright white stitching (even on the black model) at the top of the sole. I used three coats of heel black applied with a fine paint brush to kill the white and make them look normal. But I've always liked the Roper look so I'm willing to work for it.The arch support on the Basics is non-existent so that they feel like you're wearing empty Kleenex boxes. Since I'm flat-footed I assume that all my shoes will require fairly stiff arch support inserts so this didn't bother me much. The manmade uppers are not as soft as real leather so you need long socks to protect your calves from scratches, etc.If you just want some knockabout boots that look good with jeans for a casual day or evening, these are okay. They are available at a lot of sporting goods stores, Tractor Supply Centers, etc, and they're certainly cheap. But if you expect heavy use, all day comfort, great value for you money, etc. you need to spend AT LEAST $110.00, on higher end Justins or Ariats or other big names I know nothing about. Other boot experts will say you need to spend a lot more than $110.00 and I will defer to them. If you have problem feet, consider hand-measured, hand-made from a local boot maker, but bring lots of money and months of patient waiting.I can't imagine buying boots online without extensive local legwork to make sure of my size and comfort. Justin boots are sized MUCH larger than Ariat and when it comes to any pull-on boot, your regular shoe size is meaningless. The Justin website has a simple and helpful video about how to find the right-sized boot here [...] DO NOT accept a boot that is the least bit uncomfortable. Within days, you will be in agony and you will eventually give your boots to the Goodwill box.Frankly, even some relatively good manufacturers and catalog houses are sloppy about their color photos on their website, so don't be sure of the color until they come out of the box. You could be in for a surprise."
218147,1,I love shoes...I couldnt wait to get these...I had them in a few days and their great. I even got a pair for my son. I recomend the shoes and Amazon!!
255655,1,"These shoes are great and have survived the wear & tear of my two year old son. I purchased the black color and was a little underwhelmed from a fashion perspective because the white shoe looks better then the black shoe. However, the shoe is very versatile because of the simple K-Swiss design and it is all black. I can pair them up with jeans and they go well with khakis. Also, the shoelaces do not easily come undone which should be standard for all toddler shoes, but I've purchased other pairs where the laces constantly come undone. The price was a good value for leather shoes."
201711,1,"I purchased these for my new grandaughter- They are awesome & comfy!They have held up well and as a special bonus, they are the cutest baby shoes I've ever seen!"
13966,1,"i never owned a pair of ugg's til i purchased these a few days ago. once i saw them i went and bought them. i must say, these are the most comfortable slipper i ever felt. love the soft feel of the fur inside. worth the price and i wear a size 9 and bought a size 9 and fits perfect!."
145534,1,"These boots are adorable. It took two weeks for them to come to me, but it was worth the wait, because I have them on all the time now and very happy with how comfy they are. I am size 9 and ordered them in 8 and it was a perfect match."
326742,1,"I have been wearing this particular style of Reef flip flops for over a decade now. I strayed away foolishly for one summer when someone talked me into buying Rainbows and they fell apart in just a couple of months. When I lived in Florida these babies would last me for a full summer and up until the beginning of the next one when I would simply buy another pair. Now that I live in New York where there's more than 2 seasons, I can get about 2 summers out of them. I should have taken pictures of the pair that this order replaced. I had worn the tread off the bottoms and almost completely worn through the sole, but even then they were super comfortable. Although their sturdiness is amazing, what I love most about these flip flops are their ability to mold themselves to your feet in such a way that after a month or so of wearing them sometimes you forget you have shoes on (minus the fact that you're not stepping on glass or hot cement). Some people default to heels or sneakers as much as possible, I default to these flip flops as much as I can."
363589,1,"I love these loafers, especially the Velcro closure. They are a great fit all the way around. The only reason I knocked off 1 star was because the upper is coming loose from the sole on the right shoe. Think I can fix it with some Superglue, but should not have to for an $80 shoe. This happened after one wearing, but have not had the problem on the black pair of the same style. Even with this small problem, I would buy these again."
131759,0,"I ordered this shoe in black and it dyed my feet black. It is super cute, but I would caution you that this may happen. The color washed off of course, but was quite a surprise when I took them off after wearing them."
337423,1,These came a bit more narrow than the first pair I had bought 10 years ago (which I am still wearing!) but very comfortable still. They last forever and are light as a feather!
53555,1,"I grew up in keds, they have always been my favorite. Same great quality as always. Keep up the great work."
126323,1,"I bought this same shoe two years ago and really liked how lightweight it is so ended up buying the exact same shoe again! I run about 3 miles each weekday in warmer months, doing other workouts when it's winter. The only thing I could possibly complain about with this shoe is that it does seem to be a little light on the cushioning compared to some others. The light weight and balance of it made me go with it again however, and it is especially nice when it's extremely hot out as the material around the toe area is exceptionally breathable. Definitely wouldn't recommend it for cold weather running! But if you're like me and only run when it's warm and want to feel like you have no weight on your feet at all, then this shoe is for you."
272116,1,"What a great pair of shoes! Very nice looking, well-fitting and comfortable. They run true-to-size and I was really surprised at how comfortable they are, being that they are pointy-toe heels. I bought the carmel-colored ones which are a nice neutral to wear with anything."
378477,0,"I like the shoe--takes time to break in so shoe begins to fit the mold of your foot, like all Capezios. Comfortable. Really bought this shoe for everyday wear, since I like taupe to elongate your leg and foot. Makes you feel like a dancer!"
66596,1,"I own seven pairs of this sandal, in six colors, and I have purchased one further pair for my mother, who is in a nursing home in Arizona, and whose feet swell. I wear sandals 365 days a year in Idaho, as due to a thyroid disease, I cannot tolerate having warm feet. I have worn out two pairs in the past. The first one I wore for four years, daily, exclusively, due to poverty, and they stood up to the abuse. (I have large feet and I am a substantial woman.)I would recommend this sandal to anyone who suffers from any of a range of foot issues, because it is totally adjustable. The sandal is well-made; after three years, I had my shoe repair person replace the elastic under the buckle on both sandals. Otherwise, everything held up, in rain and snow, daily, in Idaho. I believe that manufacturers call that ""testing to destruction"". I replaced that pair not so much because of their age, as because I finally had enough money to buy another pair. I did not even look for any other kind of sandal, or any other manufacturer. I will be wearing these for the rest of my life.Some of the other reviewers have mentioned that they had no break-in period with this model. Neither did I. On ONE sandal in ONE pair, there was a rough edge inside on a sewn seam. I bought some moleskin and attached it to the rough place inside the sandal, and have never given it another thought.My mother is delighted with the pair I bought her for this summer; I came to this page today to buy her another color for the winter.My only wish is that a few more colors were available in 12EE. But I cannot downgrade the sandal for that. I own and wear sandals in colors I had never been able to find before in my life. Color me a happy Propet customer for life."
153644,0,"Very cute pair of shoes, however, I feel they run about 1/2 a size to a whole size bigger..."
307561,1,"Buying shoes online is always a little worrisome for me--what if they don't fit? What if they rub? With the unique model this shoe has, I was especially worried that the top of my feet would be rubbed while walking. However, I am beyond pleased. There is no rubbing at all and didn't require any breaking in to get to that point. also, the Sannibel is fancy enough to wear with slacks while pairing well with jeans and shorts, too!"
377826,1,Living in Buffalo&#60; NY the boots are doing just what I need them to do&#60; keep my feet warm and dry. Perfect as long as the snow on the ground is not too deep!!!
149260,1,These are a nice pair of casual work shoes. Very comfortable and decent looking worn with a pair of slacks. They run true to size and I would recommend to anyone looking for work loafer.
172419,1,"I bought these for my husband's birthday because his work boots were super worn out and these ones are awesome. We knew they would be though because they are Dr. Martens. They were very high quality and good looking as well. At the time I bought these they had an awesome price probably because of some slight defect but you can't even tell. Sometimes the inside label is sewn on upside down, so they mark the product down. Don't hesitate to buy!! By the way I got the volcano colored ones."
313542,1,"I bought these boots for my son, he is going on a camping trip at the end of Jan. He needed a boot that would keep him both dry and warm. He love's them!"
180609,1,My son thought these was so nice with the cartoon character on them.
2874,0,"First off, I'm only giving this product three stars because of the tongue issue. In respect to every other characteristic the boots seem fine and a well made product for the price. However, my issue involves Hi-Tec marketing these boots as having a fully-gusseted tongue. They are not, the gusset only travels half the height of the boot so that's not a full gusset, it's a half. Error to Hi Tec for marekting them as such (it's not Amazon's fault, Hi Tec even markets the full gusset on their web site and Amazon mirrors these details here). If I would have known this I wouldn't have purchased, now I'll have to send them back.Update: Even though I was disappointed because of the gusseted tongue issue I was prepared to keep these boots (after all, you generally have to pay quite a bit more for boots with a full-gusset) until I discovered a fatal flaw--poor stitching on the upper inside of the right boot. This stitching was so rough that I could feel it rub against the top of my foot after nearly every step, even through thick hiking socks. It wasn't so much of an issue after a 5-10 minute trial walks but after a couple hours of walking I had a nice patch of sore skin that hurt more with every step. I returned these boots and bought a pair of much more expensive Columbia Daska Pass hikers. I'm very pleased with the new Columbias. No bias towards Hi-Tec--the gusseted thing could be a simple mistake of the marketing department and the stitching issue was likely just a random defect. I will say , however, that in the future I will only be purchasing hikers in the in the class of the Daska Pass boots as the comfort, ergonomics and durability (at least in the soles, we'll see how the uppers hold up) are far superior."
383534,1,very comfortable shoe. I have worn these for many years & have many colors. Good with casual or dressy. I was so happy I found the black again. For a long time they weren't available.
335095,0,The previous version of this shoe ran true to size but this newer version the width is wider than normal standards. I purchased a 10 Medium and should have purchased a 10 Narrow (if they make it in narrow). The shoe overall is excellent quality but I can't give it 5 Stars because Sebago should tell their customers that their shoe runs wider than normal. I am a Sebago fan and have worn their boat shoes for many years and this is the first time that I have run into this issue. Maybe they have changed manufacturers. I just wish they would alert their customers. I can't send them back as I have worn them for several days before realizing they were to wide. Even my older model that is worn and stretched doesn't feel as wide as the new model. It is hard to tell when you first get them because the new shoe needs to be broken in which I don't remember if the older style needed much breaking in either. Seabago please take note of this issue and do something about it. Thanks
379620,1,"I had been trying everything before for to attack and improve my cellulite in my legs and button,and nothing worked at all lately.I take care of myself going to work out,being vegan and organic...and i felt in the way of depression when i wanted to wear a mini short or skirt that which i love those so much and I used to wear that when i was younger...Since the first moment I started to use finulite ,just couple days after I noticed the improvement results surround my knees.It was a miracle for me cause I was getting some info about some very expensive laser treatments that they couldn't to guarantee me about the results that I was looking for.So when I,ve done with my first finulite set,I started with the second one right away for complete the professional recommendation.It,s been few months ago that I finish with the cellulite treatment and my legs looks amazing.I highly recommend this product for real.From women to women."
309016,0,"I bought a pair for a Christmas gift for my husband. He absolutely LOVED everything - that 1)it's made in USA, 2) it's snugly and keep his feet warm, and 3) the rubber is firm and grips the floor well...until, third week into wearing the slippers, stitches on the side on one of the foot started to come off. We didn't want to pull the thread, but as he continues to wear, the top part of the thread totally came off and now I can put my finger in the whole. I didn't expect this from all the reviews that I've read, especially when I compared the quality with other cheap brands, I certainly expected it to last a little longer...."
34309,1,"Well, these shoes are pretty nice. I think they should have a better arch support and thats about it. They fit my needs, everything from walking to trail running. They even have good grip when I need to do a little rock climbing to get to a higher trail, or make my own trail. In other words they are simple and perfect.=)"
330461,1,they got here and i wear them all the time and i wear them with my dress clothes too and they look great
229340,1,"These are my favorite sneakers. I usually own two pair at any given time. They're great shoes for casual wear, work outs, I've even been complemented on them at some swanky benefits and social events. Sambas are classics, and I'll probably be wearing them for a long time."
218803,2,"They picture high tops and only write in the title that it is a converse and whatever color. Only after you order and then see the shoes listed under open purchases does it finally tell you that the item you just bought is low top. I was so upset. Deceiving and conniving company. Then you have to pay for the postage to send it back. I read an earlier review from someone who had the same problem but I thought ""hey, it only happened to one person"" Well, it happened to me too. Just be super careful and read everything.I have only just opened the box, so I don't know how good/bad the quality is yet. The sizing is right, I am a woman's 8, to that is a men's 6.It did arrive on time and the correct color and size i selected, but I REALLY REALLY wanted the high tops. The picture was of high top shoes."
174825,1,"The shoes were delivered on time. They were exactly what I wanted, and they fit well. The color matched pretty well what it was advertised to be."
225640,1,"The shoes arrived quickly, size was correct and shoes were exactly what we needed! Price was lower than any of the local vendors! Thanks!"
313397,1,I got these boot's for my son. The size was right on & look good.The only thing I had a problem wit is the wide size's! They do NOT fit like wide boot's should & they even say wide inside. Other then that they are good boot's.
181857,1,I purchased these boots in september for the hunting season. I have recently purchased another pair for my father I liked them so much.
256918,0,"I was a little disappointed in the size, but that's my fault for not reading the description. I like and very useful for the beach."
385325,1,"I have worn this shoe style for a long time. I hate to admit how long (more than 20 years). Although the product has become palpably cheaper in construction, the shoes have still held up well. To be honest, the soles have fallen apart well before anything else.If you need a very comfortable shoe for everyday use, I recommend these most highly."
344080,1,"My mom would never wear these unless I bought them, but she loves them!!! They are uber comfortable and she feels like a teenager again!"
282745,0,Shoe was attractive but runs very wide. Normally I wear a Medium but this fits like a wide.Not much arch support. Newer styles of LifeStride seem to be running very wide. Shoeswere returned.
46186,1,I purchased these boots for a trip to China in the dead of Winter. We endured temperatures below zero and these boots were perfect! And fashionable because I had positive comments from all the Chinese women asking where I bought them and how much. What a deal too. The cost was VERY reasonable!
218399,1,I love these shoes. They're fun and comfy to wear. I wore them all over Europe recently. They make me feel young and hip!
316049,1,"Outstanding boots; bought to get muddy, chopping up a fallen tree in the middle of a midwestern winter. Sturdy, supporting, water resistant, & warm."
345622,0,"These shoes look adorable, but they're inexpensive and it shows. I bought mine in white patent and I'm satisfied considering the price. I think I'll be wearing them on Halloween or other special occasions that call for fun dress up. They're not hard to walk in, the heel is high but it's stable and the platform is high enough so that it's pretty easy if you're used to walking in heels at all. I wear a size 9 reliably but I've bought Pleaser shoes before and they run small so I ordered a 10. My feet were swimming in them. I returned them (thanks for making it so easy Amazon!) and ordered my 9 and they're a little tight in the toes, but not bad. Overall great dress up fun, but the quality is not great."
194673,1,"I love, love, love these sandals, they are the most comfortable sandals I have ever worn. Wish I could find them in more colors!"
