14391,0,"I have used and LOVED Quicken since the DOS days. In those days, the founder of the company REALLY took customer calls and suggestions, and the quality was superb! Last time I upgraded my computer, I also upgraded my Quicken...BIG MISTAKE!!! I encountered all sorts of issues (BUGS), so that each time I called, waited FOREVER to speak with a warm body, and reported the issue, the response was along the lines of: "".....that's a known issue, and we're working on it"". It got to the point that I seriously considered removing the new version, and going back to the earlier one. Eventually, a new or later release solved MOST of the issues, but it still doesn't run as smoothly or is as troublefree as the earlier verision was. All I can say is that I'm not sure whether the $20 incentive to upgrade is worth the trouble that could be encountered if it hasn't been thoroughly tested in the real world. Maybe things are just getting too complex, as I also encountered a similar issue with an XP upgrade that caused my wireless network to stop working.....but I think I'll wait a few months and let others provide the beta-testing service(s) for Intuit."
809,1,"This game is a classic to me. The first game was great, but this one...this one is REEAALLY great. I mean, the concept, the the places you go, it's REALLY fun and addicting. totally recommended."
3900,0,"We recently used this software on a driving trip from Seattle, WA to Burbank, CA and were disappointed with the lists of available restaurants and hotels/motels. Many were significantly out of date. In some of the smaller cities, there was very little info. The maps portion have improved, but still not as intuitive as it could be. We had to augment our Microsoft info with maps we purchased and info from the Chambers of Commerce - the most reliable and current info.The GPS worked fine most of the time."
588,0,"XP is listed above in ""See more system requirements,"" yet customer reviewer Always N Bloom stated, ""There is no way that this 95-98-ME software can be run using XP platform."" I emailed the software company (Nova Development), asking them to confirm that I can run Christian Greeting Card Factory on XP (as stated on Nova's website). Here is their response: ""It was never tested, so you may or may not be able to run it. We have heard users give us answers on both sides. Thank you, Jeff, Customer Service Representative, Nova Development.""BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU HAVE XP, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE."
81720,0,"I was so excited when I bought theis game. At the time I didn't know much about EverGirl. I have beat the game but it certainly did not take hours. I've heard people talk about things in the game I never got to to do. Maybe it was because of my discions or everscope. I never saw where you had to lead your friends threw woods at camp. I could never buy stuff without my friends telling me to. I went to the fashion store only to find that nothing could be bought. Nor at the sports shop, electronics, or any other stores.When I bought the game it was only $6.oo. At walmart I think it was around $10.00. I was aloud to do alot of stuff on the game but, it didn't take very long at all. I will try playing again and make different descisions to see if I get a different ending. I spent longer trying to figure out if this was the full version then I did actually playing the game. I am still not sure. It was fun yet, I was somewhat dissapointed. I hope this may be helpful to anyone who might have the same problem."
21310,1,"I was extrememly pleased with Amazon on this purchase.I wasn't sure it would arrive before Christmas, so, we purchased another.The return policy, and handling by Amazon were INCREDIBLE!! I thought it would take me a couple of months of writting back and forth. It was so quick and painless, I could hardly believe it. I will not hesitate to buy anything on Amazon.com, and have told several co-workers of the positive experience. THANK YOU !"

34382,1,"I really enjoyed the memories of MAD Magazine that this DVD brings back. I was a bit suspicious whether it really covered all the years it purported to, but indeed there is an attic full of mags in there. Every last one of them.However, the quality isn't that good. The JPEGs are pretty poor quality and so it can be hard to make out the details or sometimes the words, and the little cartoons in the margins that MAD is famous for are practically illegible (yes, a big word). Not exactly hi-def (a small word).On the practical side, the disc is searchable but frankly is a bit hard to do. ""Find the Spy vs Spy where the guy is going up the building and he says 'Aargh'"" Computers need you to be highly specific and that seems hard with MAD material. If you don't remember precisely what name they perverted ""Batman"" to, then it's hard to search for all the Batman parodies. (Batsman)I never did the math to find out how much I paid versus 35c times how many issuesBut I can't say how much fun it is for an old guy to reminisce in all this MADness and to find some of the inspiration for my own view on life. However, maybe they should have put it in a DVD case that said ""Great Works of Winston Churchill"" and shipped it in a brown paper wrapper and tamper-evident plastic sleeve . . ."
40861,0,"If you can get it for free then ok BUT do not pay for it. Updates are terrible, are there map updates at all? It's handy for locating ATMs, that's about it."
54930,1,Why punish yourselves and Intuit for protecting their product? It's as user friendly as ever and makes taxes a breeze. I've been using TurboTax forever and can't understand why everyone is complaining this year. No problems here.
8152,1,"... there is fire.There is certainly a lot of fire on this CD collection of photgraphs from the turn of the century. It's easy to scroll through the different images and they print out well on my printer.I know that it's very hard for photographers to really ""catch flames"" in their shots and I have to say that they photographs they used on this CD do catch the flames very, very well.I like the black and white and vintage feel of the photos and the historical details that place them in context for me."
80641,1,"I bought this item after purchasing it on e-bay. It came from e-bay without a box, without instructions, without help from Apple. True it was only $20, but I learned a lesson. Never again will i buy from any source if Amazon has it. From Amazon it came in a box with reg. #. I was able to install it easy, and even update it from Apple without a hitch. Excellent Price, excellent software."
13858,1,"Yeah this is one of the illest music makers, however if this had more sounds then this would meata!"
54313,1,"I have struggled with recording guitar with DAWs since the beginning. After spending too much time and money on software packages that just didn't work for me, my recording prayers have been answered with this. Plug in, tune up , start the Instant Drummer and you are recording. It doesn't get any easier. You not only get a great piece of software but you can become a member of a great musical society and there is no match for the Sonoma support team. I didn't even mention the ability to collaborate with some extremely talented people on-line ""LIVE"" and chat while you are working on a project. I am so excited about writing this, I'm off to do some recording. Keep the music flowing."
65948,1,"This software actually motivated me to jumpstart my writing. It is designed to help you focus and build the bones of your story. But you have to have an idea of what you are going to write about. Better if you have characters. Using the Dramatica method helps in correlating the characters and plot. So far it has taken me to the point of having an outline of my story and working on my scenes. Take note, you will not write your entire story with this software. You will have to import your scene summaries into a word processing program. This software will not format your manuscript. I recommend the book &quot;Guide to Manuscript Formats&quot; for that. I like this software and the only thing I wasn't happy with are the images available to represent characters. Most of them look so silly that they're annoying. Overall, a good buy - just don't expect miracles. You are still responsible for your own story."
73696,1,"This is a really, really fun game! It's more of a level type game, there isn't much creativity expression in the game. It requires a lot of concentration and attention. It would be kind of fun if you could be more involved in the game.It's a great game for people ages 8 to adult, this isn't a kiddie game adults would find it fun too, and maybe even a little challenging.Overall it's a fun game and worth the money."
53813,1,"Let's be honest: Czech can be a difficult language to learn. However, this Czech Course for beginners makes it easy and entertaining. It is very interactive: your aim is to reach a certain score and the program rewards you with points every time you do something right. Try it: it is fun!"
40446,1,"Eve Dallas and Roarke (How the dickens do you pronounce this name and other Scottish phrases used in the ""In Death"" series?) are two of my favorite characters. The action is so riveting and the romance so endearing that I devour each edition whether it is my first read or the fifth. Kudos to Ms Roberts. What an awe inspiring writer."
1746,1,"The user interface is not intuitive. Plan on spending a lot of time in help.The GPS tracking, however, really works great. Even tells you when to enter and exit express lanes on the highway (except for Chicago when the express lanes change direction depending on the time of day!)."
3482,1,"I was looking for a simple software to use for my desktop publishing, and saw this.I researched it, but it is no longer available new, but I took a chance and bought it.It works great for what I want..I wasn't sure if it worked on Vista, but there was no problem whatsoever."
86356,1,"As compared with other French learning programmes, SmartFrench rates high in my view. Phonetics and meaning go hand in hand in an interactive approach that takes the learner gradually into the language. The package is user friendly and efficient. I am happy to recommend it to anyone investing money and effort in learning French."
51863,1,"These are great products, stable and much more secure than its main competitors. If virus infections or hackers concern you, you should try out these two, and better yet, try them in a Linux platform."

62763,0,"This game is just ok. It takes a little bit of my daughter's(3 and a half years old) time and she plays it when she is bored with her other games. Three of the seven places all you can do is click on an animal and then take a picture of it, those are pretty boring for her which sucks since that is half of the places to go. Then there is one where you steer Dora through a river for about a minute, which frustrates my daughter because of the way its set up and she doesn't play much. Then there is a matching the animals game which she likes there are three pairs of animals to match and find. Then there is a place where Dora stands at the bottom of the screen and you chose an animal to make her do what the animal does to get to the top. Its ok but not super fun. The last one you feed the animal what food it wants by clicking on what Diego says it wants and clicking on the frog. Not super fun but she can play most of the games on her own with little to no help from me and she's only been on a computer for a few days.All in all it took us fifteen minutes to get through it all and it wasn't that great. But like I said my daughter will play it for a bit when she gets bored with her other ones. But she won't play it for long."
1289,0,"It is amazing how Microsoft is able to kill all my system resources every time there is a new version of their product out.Macros written on Office 2000 or 2003 are suddenly extremely slow and bring sporadic errors - a new version usually brings improvements - not in this case.Opening a small Word or Excel document takes forever, after you double clicked on the file, go ahead and do something else - it wont show the file for a while - first office needs to start up which takes at least 30 seconds - and then the file will be opened, which takes another 15 seconds. When I open the same file in Office 2000 - it takes 5 seconds and I can work with it.There are some nice features, especially formatting that is impressing. If you can find the functions - MS has resorted everything and I had/have to use the help function in order to find what I am looking for - I am sure this will fade over time, but for the beginning your productivity is going down.For the price of the package, compared to previous releases, it is almost not a real improvement since everything got soo slow (do they put waitstates in the SW in order to make you buy a new PC?)HINT: Keep your old Office version installed or you will run into unsolvable problems! (or you have to invest quite some time to get your files working again, but then extremely slow:VB macros)"
26162,1,"I waited until the last moment, but when I heard MS stopped shipping XP I knew I had to take the plunge.Time to toss the well worn copy of 98 and upgrade!I was worried about my old machine handling XPsp2, but it did. After disabling some of the advanced features my computer actually runs a bit quicker now.The upgrade process went without a hitch. Make sure to use the dynamic update option and it will automatically update your incompatible drivers.Fired right up after a very long installation and 86! updates from MS and blows away 98 when it comes to crashes. Used to be a daily routine, now i forgot what that blue screen even looks like."

51214,1,"This software really lived up to my expectaions. Functional, elegant, and easy-to-use. Great maps combined with great software. I highly recomend it. The best topo software out there"
34661,0,"While there are undoubtedly some nice loops and one shot pieces on this disc, it's definitely overpriced compared to other material currently available. One CD (containing only 342 Mb of audio) for almost $50 is not good value."
88157,1,"We purchased this software for my daughter when she was younger and she adored it. Now that she's older, our 2 year old son has discovered her Living Books collection and he loves them, too! The story is wonderfully written (as are all of Marc Brown's &quot;Arthur&quot; tales) and translates well to the computer screen. I think I get just as many laughs out of the hidden objects as my son does! He was really excited when he found that some items, like Mr. Ratuburn's suit, show different results each time you click!A wonderful cd-rom for your child. Enjoy!"
6086,0,"We use this product in a small office environment. I decided to purchase it based on the fax sharing feature; the idea of having a fax server-like system at a relatively low cost was appealing. My assessment of the product is mixed. For the user it is simple to learn and use, anyone who has used Outlook Express should be able to pick up the basic features in a matter of minutes. And the ability to log and archive faxes instead of losing them in the paper shuffle has proved invaluable. For the administrator, however, expect to be challenged. Many of the more polished features don't work under Win 2000, and I've lost count of how many times I've come in to work in the morning to find the program crashed. To ease the transition for the office, I originally left our old fax machine on line as a backup. After 6 months of using this app, I still can't turn the old fax off. I would strongly suggest thinking carefully about your needs before purchasing this product."
52132,1,"Though I use this product exclusively, I am disappointed that Intuit does not support file sharing of Quicken data between computers in my home network. It would really help. Do you think that this will ever come to be?"
48305,0,"Yes, this is a word processor for kids. It is fun and uncomplicated. I will be able to use it as I do not need most of the assesories in the normal office suite. I do have one minor problem.Years ago (CPM days) when one bought a word processor one also had to buy a spell checker and a dictionary. These programs were run seperatly from the word processor and processed the data file from the word processor. Modernly I have become spoild. I was not aware that anyone least of all Micro-Soft was making word processors without these tools implanted. Did I miss something or do I have to go back to ordering a seprpate program to get these needed items?Will Cook"

1103,1,"One of the best changes ever. Great formating tools that finally make producing good-looking documents easy. You'll have to get used to the new interface, but when you do it's absolutely worth it.Regarding the Ribbon taking space - it's just about time to switch to higher resolution screens, so it's not a problem at all.I really liked the new conditional formatting feature in Excel.Enjoy."
63403,1,"I purchsed Studio Version 9.3.9. Had no problems installing or running on my Dell Desktop or Laptop. Found program easy to use, importing video worked great (wish preview window defaulted to slightly larger size), Moving and trimming clips was easy, splitting clips was easy after viewing help file. Put togtethe 3 video tapes, edited clips and readied for burning DVD in a matter of about 5 hours (2.5 hrs importing and about the same editing/ setting up menu). Would recommend to others. Only improvement I would suggest is that after burning DVD, program ask if you would like to delete the large DVD files from the hard drive."
14969,1,"Singing Coach Unlimited is a great product. My girlfriend tends to make fun of my singing in the car and claims I've ruined many songs for her. Well since I bought the product, she thinks my singing has improved and I'm no longer ruining songs for her. I enjoy the easy format that the software enables and the ability to download songs from the online store. My little sister likes the cartoon characters and finds them very entertaining. Although I've only had the product for a few weeks, I think my singing has improved greatly. I would recommend this program for the singer in us all."
52305,1,"After reading some of the reviews on this site, I was a little skeptical about updated from 2001 to 2003. I am glad I did. I find the improved layout is very easy to navigate and I do not notice all the ads that other people have complained about. I like the way they have organized the accounts in to categories. The reporting capabilities and the tax information are both improvements from my previous version. I am very pleased with the product. I have consistently updated the product every two years and I am not disappointed I continued with that pattern."

This software is for Windows 95/98 and evidently is so old that The Princeton Review website no longer exists. Broderbund Co. (The Learning Company) provides very limited support for this product. The phone numbers for both technical and customer support were no good. I was finally able to get the one CD - Grade Builder - to load and run (Windows XP) and my daughter did stay on and play the games. Yes, her text book is listed - just not the same year publication! It is incomplete. Since that is how I sold her on the CD's (it matches up with your textbook) I was foiled from the start!"

28803,0,"I like this program a lot, but if you buy it and want to have a large variety of cards to choose from, prepare to shell out more cash. The program comes with a very linited supply, but you can upgrade. I have purchased 3 additional sets, and still am not extremely happy with the selection I have (example -- I currently have only three cards for a father's birthday -- actually, one down now and two more to go -- but then what? ). Also, the cards that you purchase are on a separae CD, so you have to continually switch back and forth from the Creat a Party cd and the Art and More Store CD. Annoying! Also, there is no option to e-mail the cards as you can in other programs, but I do like having all of the other accessories, such as banners, cup covers, mobiles, signs, posters, caledars . . ."

12768,1,"I'm coming from Windows NT 4 so my impressions may sound old-hat. I like XP for the following reasons:- Integreated .zip file support (goodbye winzip)- Native cd-burning- Native support for pppoe (adsl w/dynamic IP address)- Much more powerful installer function (easily install into primary partition number 2) and apparently built-in support for mult-booting with previous versions of NT/2k.- When I installed it actually found my NIC, printer, sound and video card (3dfx). If only it could tell my mouse was wireless...- One minor improvement are the control panel applets such as display showing up on the alt-tab tasks list.- Programs seem to load quickly and the OS loads in about 27 seconds which is 3 or 4 seconds faster than NT 4.- One amazing feature is mounting a second hard drive into a folder on a drive letter. I'm sure this was a 2k feature but I like it. Also you can assign any letter or no letter to any drive/partition (but don't do this to the partition the OS is installed on).- Use the policy program (gpedit.msc) to easily change the Windows shell if you don't like Explorer (search for LiteStep for what I mean)- An amazing thing: by default everything seems very minimalist. For example when you first come in to Windows the desktop has one icon: the recycle bin. And the start-up/shutdown etc sounds are very short and to the point.Problems I have:- Activate within 30 days. I re-install my OS a lot and add hardware often. This could be a problem.- I also managed to mess up my settings some how so every time I shutdown it reboots instead. I simply re-installed to fix it.- You can easily revert to &quot;classic view&quot; and apply a &quot;windows classic&quot; theme for a regular start button but the million-and-one helpful pop-ups gets a little old after a while as does the showing off of fade-in/fade-out. Alright already you have transparancy. (I'll just turn it off)- The built-in DVD player software didn't recognice my drive as a DVD drive.- The above mentioned PPPoE &quot;dialer&quot; seems to report my speed as 100Mbs for some reason (I get a lot less then 1.5Mbs).- Properties of the connection doesn't report how fast my connection actually is while downloading (my ISP's propreitary pppoe software can do this). Over all a very good OS and to say the least light years beyond WinMe (which I haven't used a whole lot).- Yes the default theme has buttons and title bars that seem to have been inspired by fisher price. I sure grandma will love it though.- Do I really have to have MSN Messenger? Forcing it on my is as bad as netscape and AOL IM..."
26870,0,"I used to like the old Nero Burning Rom package -- Nero's strength is burning, and (sad to say) its weakness is everything else. The latest Nero 6 Ultra Edition is priced quite high, still buggy, and its functionality is surprisingly limited. Basically you get piece after piece of weakly functional software, most of it working OK but none of it very useful (except Burning ROM and Express). The GUI is very flashy, but the functionality really isn't there. In the end, the feeling is that you've cluttered your hard drive with a huge bunch of programs you'll probably never use, and that you've wasted your money.Nero has gone in the wrong direction, in my opinion. They should go back to what they're good at: Burning. Ditch the ""kitchen sink"" approach, sell the base Nero Burning ROM package and price it at half its current cost. Focus on that and they'll have a winner."
47751,1,"I just downloaded the product to use with my 2002 Turbo Tax. I had all my information entered in minutes and quickly uploaded into Turbo Tax. Now I can't wait to order another copy to use for my 2003 donations. This is quick, easy to use, and saved me an extra $.... for just one donation."
57231,1,"I sent a Terrain Navigator California Set to my father earlier this year as a gift. He just can't stop saying good things about it. So I got the New England region for myself. I use it for hiking, canoeing and sea kayaking. The GPS wizard makes connecting to my Garmin a snap. The map prints are clear and provide a UTM grid and lots of reference points. Looking at the maps in 3-D provides a real good sense of the terrain. I use this feature with the 3-D glasses which are provided. I would recommend Terrain Navoigator to anyone who works or plays off-road."
11519,1,I have just started using the program so I have not tried any of the more advanced features. It is simple enough to learn to use the product and I think it will be easy enough to learn more about it as I go. I am not very knowledgable about genealogy so it is really a good guide for me. I was pleasently surprised at how user friendly it was getting started.Gary Mc
47842,1,"I'm a little confused by some of the negative reviews. MYOB offers a trial download. You can sample it to see if it provides what you're after.FirstEdge is fairly simple, but provides the basics required for a very small business. It's worked well for my simple needs and does what it claims to do. Check the feature list and make sure you're covered."
56232,1,"I bought this game online. It does come in higher resolution versions. I bought from their website though so I don't know what this disk actually contains. I did get the same disk by mail from them and it contained several different resolution choices. So, I don't know why the other reviewer didn't get those.You can choose different ""players"" to play against with varying skill levels.I play with family quite a bit and even though I'm not an expert, I can win almost every time with this game. It's unusual for me not to win even choosing the best players to play against.It's fun and it passes the time but it doesn't really challenge me. I was hoping for something that might challenge me to improve my skills. This is not it. For the beginner, I think it's a good way to learn to play."
35530,1,"As someone who comes from an IT background, who has been a Photoshop user since version 3, I have to say the latest version of Aperture is a grand slam out-of-the-park home run. I used the trial versions of Adobe's Light Room, and Aperture, and came away from my experience with a clear preference to Apple's product primarily because Aperture's user interface is much more clear and intuitive.A number of 3rd party developers have been busy making plug-ins for Aperture, but I've found, once you understand to basic tools included in this program, you won't find it lacking much at all. On those occasions you might want them, you can pop out of Aperture into Photoshop with ease.If you feel you've outgrown iPhoto, and have any doubts this is the tool for you, download the free demo from Apple and take a test drive. Apple's site has 50 free tutorials to show you all the core elements and get you started. You'll be back to Amazon soon enough to get your copy..."
92182,1,"The smart capture feature is far better than any other product I reviewed, including Ulead media Studio Pro 6.5 and Adobe Premier 6.0. All video clips are placed in an edit window for selection and inclusion in your video. Impressive titles and transitions can be readily generated. Ripping audio from a CD into your production is a snap. Other programs will only insert audi tracks already saved in wav or anothe pc compatible audio format. I found the output quality to be identical to the original. Another reviewer complained of poor output to SVideo. If you want quality video you need to burn a DVD; SVideo is nowhere near the quality of DVD. Alternatively, you can copy a MPEG2 file to a CD and view it with Windows Media Player. I suppose output to tape would also produce good results."

What I love about Linux but Xandros Desktop Deluxe version 2.0 in general.Easy to add applications that did not come with it. It plays my audio cd's, dvd's, mp3's. I can surf the Internet and answer e-mails. I can customize the desktop. I can add skin's to applications that will allow. It knows when I plug in my camera, or external USB hard drive. If an application hangs, I can press Ctrl+Alt+Del keys and then kill the process that is hanging. But this is very rare for Linux applications. But then I can run certain MS Windows applications and this does happen to them. But no reboot of Xandors. It is not perfect, but it works for my needs."

27106,0,I was so disappointed in the new addition to the Nancy Drew games. I solved the whole case in two evenings and never once had to check with the online community to see if I was doing it right. The puzzles were not near as challenging as the other games and I was disappointed that the body of the games involves having to drive around and deliver telegrams! I have come to love these games because of the challenging aspects and the mind-bending puzzles. This one did NOT make my list of favorites.
35956,2,"This item is advertised as compatible with the Windows platform, indicating it is computer software. The item shipped is nothing but over-priced card board flash cards. Zero stars would be appropriate."
68184,2,"This software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs, but if you want to make exciting slideshows, this software is very basic and not user-friendly. I had technical problems from the start. You are better off using MS Powerpoint than this software."
45360,0,"Well when I first played this game I was thinking that this is far to easy of a game. I learned how to make it a lot more difficult though by just letting the computer pick your team. If you are not an expert at gaming, you will find this game very easy.PS If you had Ichiro it would say he has almost all power but when u swing he can't hit the ball out of the infield(dont use power with him)"
52346,0,"I purchased Norton SystemWorks 2006 Premier as an upgrade from 2003 Pro. My primary motivation was an upgrade of the Ghost module. I expected the upgrade to offer a better version of Ghost and was disappointed. It's become so automated it has become crippled. The rest of the product was okay. No problems during installation and it functions acceptably. Of course, I didn't install GoBack. I learned my lesson from previous versions. If I had it to do over, I would've just used 2003 and extended my virus coverage."
3779,1,"After all the years of using Roxio software I've become aware of the strengths and faults. I think that Version 8 has taken the best of Roxio's features and learned from the weaknesses. Readable, easy to use menus have always been at the top and this program is no exception. There are so many new features that poor menus could have really affected the overall program usability. Burning discs is a chore, but this program makes the it much easier."
3409,1,"If you go to the online HR block website you can get free federal and state e-file with Premium Federal and State. Otherwise, there is a Premium + e-file product available as well on Amazon.I have filed taxes using 1040, 1099, Schedule C, relocation, education, and dependant care expenses. I have never had a problem with the interface and any phrasing that I do not understand I can get clarified by the customer support. For extra security you can have it signed electronically by a tax professional."
65717,1,"Well I was afraid when I installed it, because like other reviewers it stops when you press some objects in the game. Found the solution right click on the icon for the game. Choose properties then choose to run it on windows 2000! It works no problem. Its a fun story and you can make fun sand castles in the game. Its great for little kids my son is 3 and other games are to hard for him even blues goes to school. This is a nice game for children under 3, older than that they will play it once and then leave it on the shelf."
66118,1,"I recently purchased Money Deluxe 2005. I have to admit I had a some difficulty downloading my transactions from my bank when I first starting using this program. In fact, it was down right frustrating, but since then Money Deluxe has been working very well. I'm glad I bought it and, I like the features and special offers! The $20 rebate is a definite plus, so is having the abiltity to monitor my credit report for free for one year. I also like that I was able to open an account with ING and get a $50 bonus!"
48123,1,"I found this product does teach you basic words and thoughts better than other CD's I've tried for language learning. However, the flaw is that the CD must be loaded, and the further you get into the lessons, the slower it gets. Further, when you go back and forth between the lessons, it doesn't cache anything, so it's like accessing it for the first time. (i.e. slow as molasses)Consider this product as an introductory product, because it doesn't teach you sentence structure, only random events that could occur in your life. But, those events do surface clearly when that occurs. That is, it seems a lot easier to remember because of the combination of phrases attached to pictures."
39372,1,"Despite its youth and inexperience, Keynote represents everything that's right about computing in the Mac universe, and easily explains why I use a Mac.My full thoughts on Keynote are too long to post here, but if you would like to read all about it, just follow this link (cut and paste it into your browser if it's not clickable):Bill Palmer's Keynote Review[website]"
56600,1,I purchased this for my 16 month old grandson as his first software. It was all that I expected and more. A terrific introduction to the computer and an excellent learning tool.
19656,0,"As a Realtor who is pushing the envelope, attempting to move to digital file keeping, digital recording, digital faxing, and digital signing, the concept of Adobe Acrobat is extremely helpful. I've been using Adobe Acrobat since version 4. Version 5 was a very useful upgrade, worth every cent. Version 6 was a grand waste of money and has turned into a waste of time. Files take longer to save in Adobe Acrobat 6, but they do end up being smaller, so maybe there is a more advanced compression algorithm at work. Nevertheless, files do take about twice as long to save in the new version.Furthermore, at least for my line of work, I see no useful additions to the software. The interface looks a little fancier, and a little more advanced with more curved lines and a splash screen with transparency...(everybody together now, &quot;Oooooh, aaaaaaah&quot;). But, at least for my line of work, I have not seen any productivity or security upgrades which make the investment worthwhile. Save yourself the money and stay with version 5.0.Unfortunately, it seems that the other reviewers' negative comments are right on the money."
79734,1,"Turbotax did what I needed, fast and easy. Yes some forms took a while to be available, but a quick conversation with tech support confirmed the IRS was the bottleneck. The forms were ready when I was told and my return came back two weeks ahead of schedule."
43542,1,"I was very pleased with this item, it ws exactly what I needed for online school, was in perfect condition and served its purpose. Thank you!"
32443,1,This is a great tool for designers who need to supplement their 2-D art with a bit of 3D. It has great integration with Illustrator and I love having this capability on my desktop without having to go to 3DSMax or beyond.
36726,1,"MathCAD is a wonderful mixture of tools for people who must deal with mathematical issues in their work, studies or investigations. It is part calculator, part Computer Algebra System, part charting package, and part Digital Publishing Package.Not only can you edit worksheets as you might in a word processor, but you can include images, formulas, and create plots of 2D and 3D functions.Unfortunately, there are a few limitations which have been addressed in later versions. The most annoying, in MathCAD 2000 and earlier, is a tendency to crash when using the mouse cursor to select portions of a mathematical expression from the right-hand side. Unless you save your work often, or take special care to only select from the left side, you will likely encounter untold moments of frustration and outrage as the software does not recover safely.My other disappointment was the differential equation solvers, in this and previous editions, are only geared to obtaining a numerical result, no an analytic or symbolic result. This is all fine and good for engineers, who seek numerical answers, but for a poor student taking a D.E. course and hoping to check his answers, I was simply out of luck.Still, the software allowed me to accomplish a great deal of calculation and derivation in a comparatively short period of time, rather than the disheartening days and weeks it would have taken otherwise. MathCAD remains one of my favorite out-of-main-stream programs."
61453,1,"I've used this software for several years-I didn't feel it was quite as good as last year. The interview did not seem as extensive as before. I do like the fact that it transfers some information from the previous year (if still in your hard drive.). However, It still is much better than another competetive program."
78411,1,"I loaded the software and started using this labeler immediately without a problem. I produced my first cd label within a half an hour. There are many, many choices for background, text and layout. Certainly more than I'll ever use. There are other features that I have not used yet, but I expect they will be just as comprehensive yet easy to use. I highly recommend this product."
87972,1,"After Effects is a great program for creating effects for video. The best attribute that After Effects has is its ability to let you create your logo or image, etc., in PhotoShop and then import it as a composition so you can animate it. The caveat is, however, that AE is at times extremely complex, especially more so in the Production Bundles and from previous versions. AE is worth the cash and definitely worth the time to master...if you can before the next upgrade!"
88298,1,Totally pleased with the effectiveness of this product converting VHS & Beta tapes to DVD format. I've only used the simple one step process and am so pleased I haven't felt the need to use the more advanced editing capabilities of this program. I'm using Windows 7 and had no compatability problems.
885,1,"I am an experienced Linux developer, so therefore I have played around with many distros, including Debian and Red Hat. After using SuSE for a while, I quickly learned that it is by far the best distro that exists. It comes with the most packages, and both KDE AND GNOME (both of which are great), and is extremely compatible with almost any configuration. It is also amazingly easy to install, as tho only OS OR a dual-boot! Whether you've used Linux before or are new to it, SuSE is the way to go."
11949,1,"I upgraded to XP over 98 and there were definte pluses and minuses:Pluses - Fixed my printer issues, my reboot issues (it would NEVER reboot in 98, it would always hang at the standby screen). It has yet to crash on me. It will let you stay logged when switching users (i.e. you can run programs while another user uses the computer). Stable and much faster than 98 Second EditionMinuses - Had to reinstall a few programs (not many though, and the ones that I did were very easy to do). Did not recognize my 3com network card (I had to go find a new driver on the 3com website...the Win2k driver works on XP). My ATI multimedia center and DVD player won't work yet (ATI is working on XP-compatible drivers).Basically, if you have 95 (God forbid!), 98 or Windows ME, upgrade NOW. This is by far superior to any of those OS's (especially ME, the worst OS Microsoft has ever put out). If you have 2000, then it is a judgement call. If 2000 works fine for you, stay with that. If you have issues with gaming or graphics or anything like that, XP is the way to go.I am so far very happy with XP. Now if I can just get my webcam working again..."
73178,0,"I really look at these 'activity center' software packages for my kids. Unfortunately there wasn't much to go on with this one.The graphics are nice, but the activities get old after about 20 minutes. My 6 year old plowed thru this and got tired of it after 30 minutes!This is one of those software programs that you are better off waiting to buy it when its in the discount rack."
57598,1,"Photoshop CS (forget the numbers from this point on, think &quot;CS&quot;) comes back with an improved File Browser, with very nice features such as the ability for users to add keywords to the files, PhotoMerge (which will allow you to seamlessly put together two or more pictures that were shot &quot;side by side&quot; as in a landscape picture of a city, for instance), and a number of great features that will make the application friendlier to photographers.Among the photographers' goodies comes embedded support for the Camera Raw file format (previously only available through a paid plug-in) and MatchColor to allow you to apply the color of one image to another. Those that scan multiple prints at once are up for a great surprise: the Cop and Straighten feature which does just that... as unbelievable as it sounds, it crops all the scanned pictures and rotate them so as to make them perfectly straight, eliminating the guesswork and the rework from this tedious process.Once again, for image processing there just is no better option (considering it comes bundled with Image Ready as usual, Macromedia Fireworks' direct competition). Photoshop has something in it for all, designers and photographers."
33255,1,"I have always been a big fan of Apple products; from using an Apple IIe in grade school, to a Mac IIsi in high school, to the very first iMac, and now to a brand-new G4 tower. Thankfully I have converted my husband as well. But when we needed a second computer in our house in addition to our iMac DV, we opted for a PC because of its lower cost. We thought it would be really great because it had XP and we'd be able to play more games on it. Bad idea. After a year and a half of use, it became so bogged down with spyware and adware that we had to reformat the hard drive twice in one week. Also, we needed to have a computer with a beefier video card than the iMac has, and unfortunately iMacs are only upgradeable in its RAM.Frustrated, we shopped around for a new Mac to replace the iMac. This time we decided to do it right and invest in a G4 tower. We bought directly from Apple, with 10.2 Jaguar installed.This machine works like a dream. My main problem with OS 9 was the fact that although it had the capability to setup different users on one computer, it didn't work all that well: if I set up a wallpaper on my ID, I would see it on my desktop until my husband signed on, and then I would have HIS wallpaper on my next startup. I also couldn't access all of the programs that he could, even though we were both set up as administrators. These bugs have now been fixed; when I login all of my preferences appear, and the same for my husband. Yet we can both access the same programs.Apple has made tremendous strides in improving their computers' interfacing capabilities with PC products, and OS X 10.2 is no exception. Included in the software are 30-day trials for Microsoft Office, along with other PC products.I could go on and on about the tremendous benefits of Jaguar, but I think it can be best summed up with this: now we are going to sell our PC instead of our iMac, and we have upgraded our iMac to run on Jaguar as well.Go for Jaguar. It truly will simplify your life. I will never buy a PC again (except for Virtual PC for the Mac- some programs just can't be run on a Mac without this program)."
71443,1,"I just got this product today but am very pleased with it so far. I really like the video helps that are included. It helped me to learn the basics very quickly. There are some things that I have not learned yet, but I do not anticipate any difficulty in learning the more complex features either.I was a Music Education major in college and have studied music theory and composition since I was 12 years old. I just wish there was a product like this when I was learning music theory and composition. It would have been a huge help to me. I highly recommend this product for those who need just a basic song writing software. Unless you need something to help with orchestration and really complex composition, this product should provide all you need to get your music written and printed in a professional format."
61930,1,I got this for my 7 year old son for Christmas. He's been more excited and consistent with this than any other exercise activity he can do by himself. He loves the scoring and sets goals for himself. It's easy and convenient to use. I like knowing the music content is encouraging and worry free. The only drawback I've seen is that the mat slips around.
88479,0,"You had better have a serious machine to make this software go. My machine is a quicksilver 1ghz G4 with one gig of ram. Not nearly enough to make logic stable.I run Ivory, Stylus RMX, Trilogy and all are useable, barely.Latency, which was acceptable with logic 6.4.3 using MOTU PCI-424 hardware, is now completely unuseable. I'm only working on sessions I did in the past with my buffer at 1024 samples (!). That's the only way the computer can function with Logic 7.1 without clicks and pops all over the placeLogic, especially using the specrasonics plug-in's crashes about 5 times a day. I've learned to save every move I make.I've been using logic since it was notator on the atari so I KNOW this software. what I'm saying is, you'd better have a kick-butt G5 with many gigs of ram if you even want to entertain the idea of using logic 7.If you have that kind of machine, then go for it, i guess."
23611,1,"An update to my earlier review: Filemaker works great with Excel (contrary to what an earlier reviewer guessed, apparently without testing). Last week I built a small Filemaker database to track contributors and potential contributors to a charitable group with which I work. Yesterday, I received an Excel spreadsheet from another member of the group, and it contained nearly 1,000 names, addresses, and phone numbers. Importing it was a snap: I simply used the &quot;Import&quot; function, choosing Excel as the file-type I wanted to import. Filemaker gave me a nice graphical interface to match Excel columns to fields in my database; it also gave me the chance to add a new field if necessary. Then a button click and the data imported cleanly and quickly, without any problems."
12025,0,"Even though Windows XP has an annoying soccermomish look to it, it does have some nice ""under-the-hood"" features that power users and developers will like: specifically multiple simultaneous logins (ahem... finally 1970's technology arrives at Microsoft) and permissions for registry keys.That said, the ""creamy"" GUI just remind me how Windows XP is a sad attempt to duplicate the OS X experience, though nowhere near as satisfying. Good news? You can turn it off and enjoy classic 2000ish look. Bad news? If you disable the annoying ""clickable"" login screen, you no longer get multiple login (""switch user"") ability.Multimedia-wise, XP seems to be more tolerant towards mm devices, much more so than 2000. It is perhaps for this reason that it will often crash, for the stupidest reasons (for me, it does so when I insert any audio CD and try to have Winamp play it). In general, it seems rather intolerant towards anything not manufactured in the last 2-3 years (sorry!)I'm glad I still have my copy of Windows 2000 around (still the best version of Windows). I've yet to see an OS that recovers from crashes more gracefully, or gives the user more control. However, if you want a Mac OS X throwback (I like OS X, but dislike Apple's tendency to automatically assume all users are blithering idiots), go with XP. At least it looks nice. If ""creamy"" GUI is your bag."
86341,1,"This software of French lessons is offered in three levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. As a beginner I thought I'd never learn a thing! But these lessons teach how to pronounce the words, how to get the proper accent, and how the written language is different from the spoken. Each lesson is done from an interview with a different French person.These lessons will NOT teach how to use French to travel or order in restaurants. While this was my main objective for an upcoming trip to Paris, these lessons introduce more than just one-liners to memorize. It is extremely important to stay focused on sticking with the lessons as to not ""lose"" the momentum that is introduced to a very unique and beautiful language.Not every teaching device will bring everything to the table of need but this group of lessons offers something unique to those who are serious about speaking properly with a French accent. Bonne chance!"
11947,0,"I upgraded from Windows 2000 Pro to XP Pro. While this is probably one of Microsoft's best efforts to date, it just hasn't lived up to the [amount]hat I paid to get the upgrade. To start things off, my Creative SBLive! card failed miserably on both upgrade and scratch install and neither the Creative nor the Windows driver solved the issue. I finally had to use a different sound card, which just irritates me -- but that's really a problem with Creative not Microsoft.Secondly, the autoplay on the CDs/DVDs is annoying. Best to go get the TweakUI power tool and disable it. I found that my CD-ROM would get so tied up every time I loaded a CD, that I just disabled the autoplay feature.Also, a Java VM is no longer built in due to the MS/Sun legal battles -- so after I did the scratch install to attempt to fix my sound problems, I then found out that I had no VM for web viewing. Had to settle for the Sun Java VM which is much slower. They aren't going to provide the VM from the SP when they release it.If you have Windows 2000 or Windows 98 -- then keep it -- unless you have to have it for some hardware or software that you have. Wait until service pack 2 comes out (or later). Let XP get through the wringer thoroughly. If you're running Windows ME, then XP is more stable (since it is based on NT) and might be worth the upgrade cost if you have stability issues -- but as for me, since I can't ship it back because I've opened the software, I'll keep it. But, if I could get my full retail price back, I'd go back to Windows 2000."
56348,0,"We bought an iMac with the intent of converting completely from PC to Mac. What was the one thing that made us keep the PC around? Genealogy. We had hoped that Reunion 8 would be a solution, but it's simply not up to par compared to Family Tree Maker. Yes, there are nice features, and the interface is pretty intuitive, even without a paper manual. But what Family Tree Maker does--and why we're keeping our PC as our genealogy archive--is integrate with Ancestry.com, as well as other genealogical search engines on the Net. I don't want to have to look up information in a browser, and then type it into my genealogy file. For that reason, I'm posting our ""used only once"" copy of Reunion 8 on Amazon, in case someone who's only a Mac user may be interested in it."
28911,1,I have used this program for a number of years in my classroom. It really has made making student awards and certificates a super breeze; I also use it to make cards and signs for parents. It is incredibly easy to navigate and very user friendly. Well worth the cost!
29575,1,"My three (and a half) year old daughter became interested in this game after we received a promotional CD at our local science museum. She loves this game, and has made great progress playing a couple of times per week over the last few months. I think this game will hold her interest for several years, since there are three levels of difficulty.My only complaint is that in order to complete the game, the player must go through a section that involves a high level of physical control (the characters are running and jumping from object to object in traditional video game style) which younger players might not have. We just skip this part, but it would be nice after all her hard work using her brain (critical thinking skills definitely required) to have the reward at the end without my help. The recommended age is 5-8, so perhaps at those ages this part of the game would be accessible."
29828,1,I got the order really fast within 10 days. Word of advice is to make sure you have your other virus and spam blockers turned off or disabled so that you can install this new stuff.
26762,1,This is the best S&Ts by far with voice commands and large directional and distance information; connects effortlessly to Magellan GPS. Just came back from a 500 mile trip with it running the whole time.... took me right to the door of a destination I had never been to before. Accurate every step of the way... excellent voice quality on direction and distance.... One does not even have to look at the laptop screen for an entire trip. Well worth twice the price. What is missing on the pocket PC version is fantastic on the laptop version: the route and the voice info.... so 5 stars for the PC version and 3 stars for the pocket PC version. I still would not be without it for the pocket PC even with the shortcomings.

93904,1,"I updated to XP and than did my homework on several CD burning softwares for several weeks, Click'N Burn, Nero, ect. I found Allot of negative stuff on Roxio ECDC5, but took a chance and found it to be very easy to use and install, as long as you download the 2 updates on Roxio.The software is packed with allot of options.I think some people are not reading the instructions. Make sure your CD-RW is on their list, your CD-ROM supports &quot;digital audio extraction&quot;, get any Roxio updates and you'll start burning CD's not coasters.It's really the best don't be fooled by others."
31633,1,"I have a variety of computers with a variety of operating systems. 2005 was incredibly lousy on my older machines--every bad thing people have said is true on ME, etc. But, on XP and with a relatively modern/powerful machine, 2005 worked like a charm. Its resource hog issues will not be a problem, as there are so many available. Certainly, it's a wonderful program to run if you're looking for a bargain at this date and/or if you like to use a third-party firewall and don't want to have to deal with switching off a suite's firewall features with those attendant problems. For these purposes, it's a good stand-alone anti-virus, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as such to those with newer machines."
74972,1,"This is an excellent product for a beginning Hebrew student. I would note that it would be good for the beginner to have the ability to slow down the speed of the recording. I will sometimes reduce the speed by about 40%. By the time I am more familiar with the passage, the normal speed is fine.The quality of the recordings are excellent. The voice is pleasant.I should note that I have found a few mistakes in the readings. These may be dialect issues, but a beginner may want to confirm with his teacher the pronunciation of the waw with a shureq vowel followed by a shewa vowel. In these recordings, the initial shewa is left silent under those circumstances.I should also note that some recordings are a bit difficult to find. Not all the readings are divided chapter by chapter. For example, it may take a bit of searching for example to find the reading for Gen. 38. You cannot just listen to the file number 38 since there are over 50 files for Genesis. For at least the Pentateuch, the mp3 files are not necessarily organized chapter by chapter. This is not true for the entire Tanakh. The cover for the CD's notes that the readings are arranged by book, chapter, and weekly portion.These slightly negative comments should not in anyway detract from the overall value and use of the recordings. Highly recommended."

It gives me everything that I require: split video into chapters, create convenient motion menus and burn DVDs.The package also includes Tsunami encoder, but it is not advertised on Amazon."
20842,1,"I have been using Mastercook since version 2. Even though it hasn't been improved for years it'st still the best of the bunch. Its interface is not window-like but actually very usable and nice-looking. I love the bookcover representation of each cookbook. I make my own cover w/ photoshop, and you can find free covers on the web too. Searching and meal planning is really easy. You can insert a picture for each step of the direction too. Overall it has just about any feature you can think of for a cookbook, and there are tons of recipes on the internet that's in Mastercook format.About Vista compatibility - I have vista and it works. There's a website that tells you exactly how to do that (google it for Mastercook and Vista). For the IE web import bar to work you must run IE as an administrator. I also use a free program called Tweak-UAC to turn off the annoying Vista prompt whenever I start Mastercook.Now the bad things - it doesn't support unicode so I cannot enter any recipes in Chinese or any other language. This is not a problem for most people though. The ingredient database cannot be updated (you CAN add your own ingredients there but it would be nice to automatically update to the newest USDA database. The rumor also suggest that ValueSoft won't make further improvement to this software anymore, which is a shame. Even the best software fades out after a long time if it's not kept up (remember WordPerfect for Dos?). It would also be nice if it can export shopping list to modern handhelds such as the iphone, ipod, and all smartphones."

29931,1,"I received this product on Oct. 26,2006 and have been using it for only three days, so my observations are a little limited.I successfully installed the program and created an account with Symantec -- no problems there. It ran a full system scan and found and removed some problem files. However, as another rater posted, it slowed down Windows to an agonizing crawl (it took over a minute just to launch an application). Every click of the mouse key meant at least 20 seconds for Windows to respond.Disappointed and wondering if I was going to have to invoke Symantec's warranty of a 60-day refund if not satisfied, I uninstalled the program. With Norton gone, Windows ran FASTER than before I had installed Norton! It must have cleaned up something.So, I went to Symantec's site and found their ""FAQs"" (had to use their search engine to find them) and looked for a problem similar. There was one, and it said that my system might not have enough memory. I checked the system requirements on the box, and it said 256M required, and I have 2G. I re-installed Norton (no problems), let it run a full system scan, and began experimenting by disabling all except the basic feature. Windows ran normally. I then added features back (by checking the appropriate box) one at a time and discovered the most resource-consuming routine is the Automatic Updates. I'm not sure, but it seems that the speed of your internet connection would affect this also (I have a high-speed connection).With the automatic update disabled, I ran a full system scan again, and it found one virus. Windows now runs normally, and I'm satisfied. Will just have to remember to run the updates periodically.Update: No need to remember to run updates periodically. It has a feature that reminds you when Symantec has an update ready.Update #2: Some virus must have gotten by this program because only about four months into the subscription, I got the ""blue screen of death."" The computer would not load Windows, but it would let me run it in Safe Mode. I could not solve this problem and called in an expert. He was not able to solve it either. I ended up builting a new computer, but this time I installed AVG (free) anti-virus, the one the expert recommended. It seems to work better than Norton."

The main change is (if you do not change it) is when you save a file in the new OFFICE Word, for example, it saves the last name of the file to DOCX. The older OFFICE versions 97-2003 saved the last name of the file to DOC. So what happens if you do not do the simple steps that I will explain in this later, is that when you just SAVE a file in the new Word, the older WORD 97-2003 cannot read it. But great news, you can FIX this problem so that if you are like me, you go from the OLD OFFICE to the NEW OFFICE and then BACK TO THE OLD OFFICE AGAIN with files. So here is some helpful info to let you be able to work in the NEW OFFICE and then open up the file you saved in the NEW OFFICE to the OLD OFFICE: If you plan to read and write ANY OFFICE 2007 file and open it up to use later OFFICE 2003 (and even OFFICE 2002), this is what works wonderfully and allows you to use the OFFICE 2007 file in older OFFICE PROGRAMS from 1997 to 2003: While in OFFICE 2007, do this: go to the ROUND OFFICE button on the left, choose SAVE options, then choose SAVE AS OFFICE 97-OFFICE 2003. This allows you to save the file in the older OFFICE formats which each of the older OFFICE files end in the letters DOC for example the this file called VACATION-2006.DOC has this name because it was saved in the OLDER OFFICE(this is a older Word Document). (You want to do this step first as soon as you get the NEW OFFICE 2007 because if you do not do this, the program will save the last name file with the extenstion of DOCX and not DOC). The older Word 97-2003 can only read files that end in DOC, this is why you need to do this. Then later when you go to save a file in OFFICE 2007, go to the ROUND OFFICE BUTTON again. Choose SAVE AS. You then choose the SAVE AS OFFICE 97-2003. I have done this everytime I work in OFFICE 2007 and need to open up an OFFICE 2007 file in OFFICE 2002 or 2003. Even with some of the newer features found in OFFICE 2007 such as the PICTURE FORMAT with the more border features, I have not had a problem at all when I save the file this way and then open it up in either OFFICE 2002 or OFFICE 2003. When you use EXCEL 2007, this procedure is done the exact same way. At first, I did not like the new OFFICE 2007. However, I found that after you click each area of the RIBBON, you quickly learn where everything is and is becomes easier and easier to learn. You know what helped me the most in OFFICE 2007? Right clicking my mouse for an INSTANT MENU. Then about 95% of the time, this INSTANT MENU gives me the feature that I need the most and is the quickest to use. However, I sat down and clicked each area of the RIBBON for about 15 minutes and then I learned the program. And I am a long time MS OFFICE user of many years. And using the right mouse key for an INSTANT MENU works great in ANY Windows program from OFFICE to Internet Explorer. The reason that I just gave this program a 3 and not a 5 is that I feel that the filing system should have kept the older DOC and not added the DOCX. However, this can be overcome, I know as I did the above steps and have opened MANY OFFICE 2007 files in my OLD OFFICE 2002 (and that is wonderful)!"
75487,1,"If you are getting this game you must have the first game, so im sure you already know how fun it is. This add-on pack makes it 10 times better. There are about 10 new path styles, at least ten more coasters, 1 more staff, tons of new gentle rides, and even a new water ride. Also, there is TONS more scenery. And last, but not least many more great scenarios. I found it more of a challenge than the original, but that just adds to the fun. If you liked the original, then you will LOVE the add-on. Well worth five stars."
91090,1,"Old standby Adobe Illustrator 8 for OS 9 fills my bill. I still use a few graphic arts applications that run under OS 9; every once in a while I use AI 8 to ""get it done"". Other than cross-platform Inkscape, not many vector drawing programs offer AI 8 functionality, OS 9 or any other platform."
88463,1,"I have had the Ring Disc for several years now, and am glad that I got it when I did. It is a spectacular thing, and can be used for all sorts of things.If someone is new to the Ring and all that it holds, this disc is indispensable. Not only do you get the libretto for the entire work, but simultaneously you can follow the score as it progresses. Add to this the the ability to isolate each leitmotif, and you are in Wagner heaven!Also included: the ability to identify each character, get a synopisis and see loads of pictures which correspond to the work, and more...I have used this for my own personal Wagner journey, as well as using if as an adjunct to several Ring Cycle programs I have given. I would not know what to do without it.Beg the creator to issue this again-or find a friend who has one. You will treasure it. I promise."
3092,1,"It has many new exciting things, compared to my old program. I wished it had a few things different. It isn't real clear looking when you do a preview and you have to take it all the way as if you were picking it and if you don't like it you have to start over. That is the main dislike I have of it.But overall its a good progrm"
89843,1,I have used the free version for ages and have loved it. I decided to upgrade to PRO for the additional features.I immediately browsed the same web sites on 2 computers sitting side by side. One had Zone Alarm and the other didn't. All the annoying pop-up ads disappeared on the Zone Alarm machine. What a relief.I decided to subject it to the ultimate test. I went to an adult site and then closed the window. The un-protected machine immediately started opening all the other adult site windows. The Zone Alarm machine closed the window cleanly.Anyone that has visited an adult site knows that it is next to impossible to close one adult window without 3 more opening up.I am very satisfied.

27646,1,"With certain recent games like WAC and SAW, it's evident that with each and every Nancy Drew PC release, the graphics and voice acting get better and better. But sometimes, no matter how good the graphics are, they usually can't hide an empty storyline and a game in need of many touch ups. This game is an example of a decent edition to the series, and even though it's not one of my favorites, it doesn't need ""makeup"" to make it shine.Story: 8.5/10. This game has a decent story that holds together pretty well. Much of the game centers around centuries old history, much of it on Marie Antoinette. Although you ended up learning a few things, the story was still very inticing and it wasn't like they were shoving all of the information down your throat.Graphics/Setting: 8/10. I'm not going to rate a lot of this game on graphics, mainly because the graphics of today are automatically compared to these graphics, and considering this game and the new games were released a decade apart, I think it's fair to somewhat disregard the graphics. I liked the setting, even though you stay in one place, and I like moving around more. But this castle was ginormous, and I had plenty of trouble just finding my room.Characters: 8/10. The characters this time all have pretty stand-out personalities. You have Dexter Egan, the caretaker of the building, Professor Hotchkiss, a hilarious if not somewhat annoying author who can never get Nancy's name right, Lisa, a photojournalist, and Jacques Brunais, a french ski intructor. They all have a distinct personality, and are a great touch to the overall atmosphere.Puzzles: 7.5/10. They're weren't that many puzzles, but the ones that were there were hard, but they fit the game.Exploration: 9/10. Exploring is a big part of this game, and I got lost a lot. The castle is so big, and there's plenty for you to explore and have an adventure in.Activities: 4/10. Activities weren't really evident in the older games, and they're weren't any here either.Ending: 6.5/10. The ending was somewhat not surprising, and a pretty simple one too, yet it still gave me the goosebumps that good Nancy Drew PC endings give me. You people know what I mean.Total (averaged): 7.3 out of 10, rounded to....7.5/10.As a diehard Nancy Drew PC fan, I did enjoy this game, and it deserves a spot on any fan's shelf."
87526,1,This product works out of the box like other SMB accounting products I have used. It is better than the OS company's and equal to the checkbook company's product. (I don't work for any of them.) I am not an accountant either.Sage should have a port to Mac.What are those others talking about? What level of skill do they have? You need to understand.
48627,1,"The best web site design tool on the market. After using frontpage for 2 years, I can say, without a doubt, Dreamweaver is number one and will be my only site design tool in the future. Cant beat the price for both applications."
24531,1,"I love the game! It's very realistic and fun. But sometimes when I play it, I never get past the original city to get my supplies. DO NOT follow what your trail guide says about getting suplies. You always end up getting too much. When your out on the trail, make sure you have a gun and the stuff you need to work it, fishing gear, and plenty of vegetables. When you run out of meat, you'll need to hunt a lot. Be sure to gather a lot too. Especially right before winter, you can't gather then."
86803,1,"I've been using Ubuntu since version 6.06, and I love it! Some of the more useful features include:1) Synaptic Package Manager - A central location in which I can find and install/remove just about any software. Windows has nothing like this!2) Automatic updates, for all installed software. Not just what came preinstalled with the operating system.3) Hardware support - With the exception of certain ATI graphics cards (and that's ATI's fault for writing bad drivers), Ubuntu's hardware support is the best I've seen. You plug something in, it works, end of story.4) Clean, well-designed, and infinitely customizable interface. My Ubuntu looks *exactly* how I want it to look."
20031,0,"My daughter loves science and LOVED this program. However, like another reviewer mentioned, it is NOT compatible with XP and after using the software for several weeks it refused to continue to work. If you don't have XP and your child likes science I would highly recommend this product."
74098,0,"Product worked as stated to remove partitions from my hard drive. I have an 8 gig divided into 4 drives and C was filling up. Beware! you must run Drive Mapper (in tools) before you open any programs that were in partitions that you eliminated or even shortcuts if they are in other partitions. There is not a warning to do so and caused me a full day of fixing the problems. Also run defrag when you are finished. It took 17 hours to run mine (Win 98, 300 mghz Pent. 3)Now that it's over, I am pleased with the product. Make sure you know a computer person. This is not for amaturers"
28621,1,"My Daughter is hooked, but I can envision product improvements:I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who used to compete in gymnastics. Although see never got past level 5, she really loves the sport, and tumbles whenever she gets the chance. She now works with the high school team. She wasn't sure about this game at first, but once she got past the boring introductory period, she's spending lots of time creating routines.I hope the developers put some more effort into creating follow-up versions of this game. My daughter would love to be able to create routines and use her own music creatiions. She has a music editing program and has been creating floor music as a hobby. It would be great to have her create complete routines. If it were possible to create routines and save them to a format which would run independent of the game, she would love to be able to make the routines portable to bring to her high school team practices, and to share with others.I also think the developers need to get together with USA Gymnastics so they can create a product which more closely resembles the way a meet is actually run. They should have all the levels, and each level should have a set of required elements. Players could then create optional routines within the level using these required moves. It could also be a great teaching tool at gyms."
48047,1,"This was purchased for my daughter when she was 7 months old - she really didn't grow into it until she was over a year, but at 3 1/2 she still requests it for some of the fun little games. I'm about ready to introduce it to my 14 month old son - It's great to have good beginner software out there."
51216,0,"According to the specifications this product is only available for Windows 95, 98, or NT and supports just a few GPS devices. But it is based on the same program (Topo) used in National Geographic State Series, which is compatible with windows 2000, XP and 60+ GPS receivers. You only need the free Topo upgrade available at Nevertheless, TrailSmart series was created by scanning Trails Illustrated maps, so don't expect the quality of USGS maps found in the State Series. In my opinion trails don't have enough accuracy in this product (I tried Yellowstone)."
62886,1,this is a must have software to keep in touch with all your friends on the move. I have it on my 6600 and I LOVE it
78607,1,this is a nice game. you get to take care of your own horse and do compitions and help out people. don't listen to anyone else. on the computer if brushing takes too long go to options and turn the particuls on. also in real life if it takes you less than five musnutes to groom a horse you must not take care of it welli recemend this game to horse lovers of all sizes and ages!
18706,1,"I like this software better than Quicken 2003 for Mac. It adds a tab called &quot;Quicken Insights&quot; that gives you and overview of all your accounts. You can customize it to show upcoming bills, net worth and other items as you prefer. There is also more analytical information on investments. The software installed flawlessly on my Mac which uses OS X and imported my file in a minute or so from Quicken 2003 without any errors. Registration was a snap. The product is not as robust as the Windows version but works well. The new reports available are very snazzy. I like Quicken 2004 for the Mac."
19454,1,"I admit I'm a Borland devotee, having used their development products for the past ten years. And while I don't think the visual basic IDE's as bad as some people do (especially the latest version), I'd have to say Borland C++ gives you a versatility VC ++ can't touch. Borland's interface is brilliant for GUIs - you just drag your components onto a form, and then alter/optimise the code you need to. Additionally, the GUIs it creates are platform-independent, so all you have to do is recompile to get your program working on another platform. The compiler itself is incredibly fast - this is definitely the best RAD environment available for C++, and I'd say the tool of choice for any serious professional developer. (Having said all this, Borland's eagerly awaited C++ Builder 2006 is now available, although not yet via Amazon.)"

88070,1,"If you have just started or are into your first year of Spanish, or, if you took a few years of Spanish long ago and want a refresher, this CD set is a must have -- and a huge bargain. The two CDs offer a lot of *fun* as well as a *lot* of quality exercises -- it will take you many, many hours to get through them all, and I found myself doing most of them a second or even third time. These CDs will help a lot in reinforcing the basic Spanish vocabulary you are learning in class (or used to know). There is no verb work. Works on both PC and Mac (I'm on a Mac, running system 9.x -- no problem)."
86980,0,"The first CD starts out well and the grammar lessons are great, but as the CD goes into the ""prasebook"" part, it becomes difficult to follow (the female speaker, especially, speaks too fast). Oh well, I did pick up a few things at least!"
26273,1,"I liked this game. Being a Humongous Entertainment fan myself, I found that it fit in nicely with the rest of the Freddi Fish universe.One thing that I can always rely on from Humongous is fantastic titles. However, ever since the release of Pajama Sam 4, I've doubted that. Overall, highly recommended."

4729,2,"I run Win98 and a Pentium 2. I replaced the 2001 version (which ran fine). This slows down my system to the point of being unusable. I installed, uninstalled, custom reinstalled with less features with the same result. Installed OK, may run OK on P4 machines. Wouldn't use with older hardware."
28652,1,"Add in the OptionPack, and you've got IIS4, transaction server, MSMQ, and the ability to host great products like SQL Server, Exchange, and SNA server.NT 4.0 was the workhorse of the late 1990's! Let's face it there were numerous organizations that Held onto NT 4.0 until Windows Server 2003. Windows 2000 & Exchange 2000 were duds, NT 4.0 + Exchange 5.5 was the 'real deal'.You cannot beat NT 4.0's simplicity to manage, it's ultra small footprint, and its fantastic base for supporting mid level applications. This is what Novell Netware 3.x should have been, but it was too freaking impossible to manage compared to NT 4.0."
31006,0,"Recently purchased the upgrade download straight from Ulead's site (had an OEM key for Version 8 SE). The product is certainly more feature full than Windows Movie Maker and, consequently, complex in comparison. However, it's not as intimidating as, say, Vegas Movie Studio. I appreciate the multitude of format output options and the relatively strong ability to customize them. The DD 5.1 feature could be a bit more intuitive however. I've found that simply dragging the spatial icon around isn't enough to fully isolate channels, you need to play with levels as well, which I think is unnecessary.One thing I have found, however, is fairly shoddy performance overall. I'm running Vista HP x32, Core2Quad (q6600) and 3GB ram, yet the program...""lags"" for lack of a better word. Over time and use during a session the program just seems to become less and less responsive. I don't believe it's a memory leak because RAM usage seem in line; same goes with processor usage. So I don't know what the deal is.I've toyed around with the trial of Vegas Movie Studio Platinum and it seems to provide much more solid performance. Though it lacks some convenience features of VS11.5+ (Burning HD video to standard DVD for example) it does seem to be a more pro-sumer product and offer more advanced features and abilities overall."
93726,0,"I got this GPS after much searching. I needed one for hiking and geocaching and this little dude was great! I never could get the card reader to work, but uploaded maps onto the card using the supplied cable. It is a tough GPS too; I dropped it numerous times (including in the water) and never had an issue.I only had two problems with this GPS which eventually caused me to upgrade to the PN-40. First, sometimes it would just sap a battery down instantly. This only happened once or twice, but I would turn on the GPS and within five minutes it would shut down. Second, the processor in this is rather slow. It works when you aren't used to other electronics, but compared to ipods and higher end models, it is slow and annoying.Overall, I would say this is a good beginner GPS to figure out if you like this type of GPS. If you want to do some driving with the GPS and want extra space and processing power, go for the PN-40 or higher."
52770,1,"I started my web page (...) using an online page builder. A good way to start, but not very creative. I then moved up to Adobe PageMill which gave me even more opportunity to design the look I wanted. When I decided on Dreamweaver, it was out of a desire to make my page look even better, and work across platforms. It does the trick.The program is extremely user friendly and easy to learn. Always a good thing when you're dealing with a limited schedule. The FTP interface even makes sure your support files go with the html page. All in all, a must have for the web head in you."
58273,1,"This is the third Nancy Drew cd game I have purchased. I have bought them in reverse order, though, with Message in a Haunted Mansion being first, then Stay Tuned for Danger, then this one. I highly recommend all of them. They are all a lot of fun, challenging and humorous in places. My only complaint on this one (which wouldn't change my opinion on how much fun it is to play) is that this is the only one out of all three that uses cartoon drawings for the characters, instead of 3D graphic animation, like the other two. The scenery is all 3D,though, just like the rest. Needless to say they improved upon this minor detail in the other two games. They are definitely must-buys!"
34614,0,"I found the product difficult to understand and use. But then, I am not a 'tech-type' guy so it may have just been me and not the software."
25431,0,"I am still getting familiar with the features on this one. I was very impressed when I was able to rotate my video 90 deg. I forgot you can't frame video by camera rotation, at least not until now!The only minus I have found so far, since I do some professional editing at church on a larger system, is that videos have to be chopped up into clips in the Movie bin. As opposed to the clip bin. If you chop a large clip into smaller clips in the project area, which is the only place you can do it, I am not able to easily save off those small clips for other projects. The only way that I see to do this is to create a separate project for each small clip, save it, then start the main project.But for the price, this minus is far out weighed by all the plusses. Good job Adobe.Dan"
43254,0,"I upgraded to MS Office 2007 so that I could more easily read those files in the new .docx format. MS Office has the new ""Ribbon"" interface, which seems to offer few new features, but takes up much more screen space (and can not be turned off). What a waste of space. Also, the new Ribbon hides several of the well-known commands that I had always used. For example, where is the ""show/hide table gridlines"" command? Not even Word Help can find it.I installed all the default features, but Office 2007 keeps asking me to install the same features. For example, yesterday Word wanted the thesaurus, which was already installed. Word asked for the Office 2000 (not Office 2008) installation disk. It would be nice if MS did more quality testing and usability studies before they released their bloatware on the public."

52498,1,"I used Quicken extensively for years and loved it a lot. Few years back, when my portfolio started to melt like ice on salt, I quit using Quicken as I was scared to see my stock losses grow each day. Recently, a very good deal on Money 2003 Delux at CompUSA prompted me to get back to the habit of tracking my financial life. It's just been 2-weeks and I already like it a lot. I don't know how well it compares to Quicken 2003 but I sure am happy for getting it.The best thing about Money 2003 is the interface. I like the web look and feel. You can customize the views and display the features you want on home page. With some credit cards and banks, you can setup automatic downloads that will sync your account with the bank. Saves you from a lot of data entry. You can display your budget views on the home page. At times, I can just get all the info. I need on the home page and not worry about running reports. You can setup a passport account at MSN's Money website and you will be able to entry your expenses online when you don't have your PC with you. When you get back to the PC, your Money syncs with the new entries you made online. You can also use the Car View to track info about your cars.On the downside, there sure are few annoying bugs but they didn't bother me much as most of them have work around. This is my advise to anyone who runs into minor problems using money. Delete the transaction and re-enter it and all related problems may be solved.Finally, the microsoft support is excellent. Also, you can use the message boards at http://support.microsoft.com/newsgroups/default.aspx. Just make sure you select Desktop Applications and then Money to view the Money board."
56907,0,"If you want to print photos that look the same on paper as they do on your computer, you have to start with a calibrated monitor. This does an OK job if you can figure out how to apply the instructions to your monitor. I can't recommend it unless you have no other option."
12286,0,"For the most part, I'm quite pleased with Windows XP. I don't know what other people are doing, but all of my hardware aside from the RAM from old computer works fine. XP has a lot of the drivers for your hardware built in. My CD-Burner and CD-Rom were a snap to get up and running, along with my hard drives, floppy and monitor.My biggest complaint is the strange occurence of mouse problems. I know I'm not the only person to experience this, but if you've got a Windows Intellimouse Optical USB (you know, the infared mouse) it will frequently freeze on you. To the OS's credit, you only have to unplug and plug it back in, but it happens all the time.Otherwise, it is quite stable and makes your computer faster. My programs boot faster and when a problem does occur, I don't see the blue screen that makes some of us insane. Usually the computer recovers and you can keep going.I actually like the automatic update thing which never,ever worked in Windows 98 and it's quite easy to use and understand.I also like the new look that the computer enviroment gets. It's not a piece of art or anything, but it's refreshing if you're used to the 9x look.I would score Windows XP higher if I didn't have to constantly unplug my mouse, although there's no compelling reason to purchase it if you're Windows 98 is working and you're happy with it."
83202,1,"I am glad I did the upgrade. There has been a little bit of a learning curve, but worth the time for the new features in Office 2007."

60022,1,"Word 2003 includes development tools that add dynamic features to documents making them powerful than ever. The power beneath all this is XML, allowing the user to embed components for updating data in documents such as stock quotes. Word 2003 offers simple, familiar yet improved features regular users are accustomed to. Majority of the features in Word 2003 are aimed primarily toward businesses and the Enterprise. But are still necessary for the average user because of the control over information across all the Office applications. Tools such as Information Rights Management (IRM), (this controls the flow of information to specific users), persons can be restricted on how they use your Office files; whether it's printing or sharing, very powerful! Reading view is an enhanced mode of print preview; documents are laid out in virtual pages reducing the need to print. The Task Pane is also improved by offering resources to look up information on a particular topic being typed; this is a feature across the core Office applications. Lots of other great features make Word 2003 a worthy upgrade.Excel is a XML mammoth because of the integration with the language. The ability to migrate data between different storage sources and extraction of information to make it flexible in different scenarios. Tables can be transferred back and forth between applications such Word with ease. Excel can continually use the tables from documents as a data source for further expandability. It's the flexibility for data exchange that makes Excel 2003 very powerful.Outlook, is so revamped, this alone is a worthy upgrade. Three panes in Outlook 2003 make e-mail an enjoyable experience. The Mail Pane holds all of the necessary tools found in prior versions of Outlook such as the Outlook Bar, and the different folders such as inbox, calendar, etc. The second pane gives an expanded view of the different items listed in the Mail Pane, like your incoming mail, contacts and calendar, which makes reading these information resources easier on the eye and productive by providing a better view. Reading your e-mail in the third pane (Preview Pane), the user views the message in portrait layout, more content is seen compared to prior versions. Its even better to view e-mails with ""Clear Type"" turned on for Windows XP users. Other features such as improved Virus and Spam protection makes Outlook 2003 a great upgrade. Outlook is not placed on the desktop by default, it can also be minimized to the system tray in Windows, for users connected to an Exchange Server, this displays all the network settings available.PowerPoint 2003 offers the same features of version 2002, but what makes it an enticing upgrade is the package to CD feature that allows users to save presentations onto CD-ROMS. The PowerPoint Viewer included with each Package to CD allows it to be played on other computer systems even if PowerPoint is not installed. Windows media integration is also in PowerPoint 2003, which makes watching presentations more fun and exciting. The effects are fantastic when combined with these elements. The ability to integrate videos into Presentations to create home movies has long been a request of users, even if they have a DVD burner. For the PowerPoint 2000 user this is a worthy upgrade that provides simple yet Powerful tools to take presentation graphics to a new level.Publisher has become a mainstream Office application because of its integration with other Office programs. It connects to product databases; the Mail Merge feature is much improved because it's the same one as Microsoft Word, which offers greater ease of use. The Start Center is awesome, which makes starting publications an organized experience for the user. The interface is less cluttered and more customizable. You can rename pages like Workbooks for better searching, if you are typing large publications. The website features are easier to use; it provides satisfactory integration with FrontPage, for converting websites created in Publisher. With a total of 45 design master sets, users can create attractive e-mails that are fully compatible with many messaging services. The ability to merge data sources using text and images is great.

93094,1,I just purchased Musicmatch Jukebox Plus and I love it. I was shopping around for a audio cd converter to mp3 and found this software to be the best. It does more than just convert audio cd's. It's very user friendly and it's well worth the price.
13564,1,"This game is truely a fun game. You get to save the city as a firefighter, police man, and a paramedic. So try to rent it some where before you buy it. It's a very hard game. I recommend it for children 8 and up. But it's up to you parents. So go and play it. Have fun. You will Love. Play it or else. Go and get it NOW! Thanks."

20761,1,"While there may be other great piano samples out there and there definitely are - possibly more interesting than these - what is amazing about the way Propellerhead implemented this is the flexibility and tone shaping possibilities. They including several mic positions for each sample - ALL of which can be raised or lowered which dramatically effects the tone in a very real world studio way. If you have experience recording, you will know what I am talking about. Mic position has a huge effect on sound. I don't know of any other sample library that does that as effectively and intuitively as this one. The pianos overall are nice though most are too shiny and bright for my taste. Pulling back on the close mics helps that. It also obviously is meant for use with Reason and Record which makes it the ""go to"" piano library if you use those programs."
16389,1,I bought this item and then found the one it was replacing.. I emailed the seller and they returned my money.Very good communication and very HONEST seller.
27029,0,"There were hardly any places to explore on the game and the puzzles were easy compared to other games. Also there is a part on the game where you drive with an ariel view and it gets really annoying. There are a few parts of the game that were neat, but I would reccomend a different Nancy Drew game if you have never played one before."

21074,1,"I read a couple of positive reviews, ordered it, it works better than anything else I've tried. I enjoy running Zone Alarms's spyware tool that is included in the pro version of their firewall just prior to ""Spy Sweeper"" to see how many Zone Alarm misses."
60027,1,"This was another purchase for my husband. He explained to me what it was for and he'd wanted one for a long time. He used to have these when he was building kits to identify the somethings...One thing that confused me (and him too)--the photo on Amazon shows this to be in what looked like a gray case. This doesn't come in a gray case. It doesn't need a case, it is just some way they were displaying it in the photo."
38323,2,"I give TurboTax only 2 stars. Turbotax is an expense, not a money-saving device. I used TurboTax for the first time after always doing everything by hand for personal and small business. I do not plan to purchase it again next year. The software cost $80.00 for one year's taxes (subtract one star for high price). Then you are expected to pay $15.00 or so to file electronically (subtract 2 stars for ripoff service). I am pre-paying each year in excess by less than 1%, so I think that the interest that I lose on pre-payed taxes is less than Turbotax and e-file costs. I just printed my return and mailed it. Turbotax perhaps simplifies data entry somewhat, but by the time you review all of the thousands of questions and options that it provides, you can be finished with your hand calculations. Perhaps you can save some time in subsequent years and maybe you can improve accuracy of data filing, but Turbotax did not perform any special calculations or identify anything surprising and it certainly did not save me any money - Turbotax is an expense. I do not think that it saved me any time in doing my taxes this year and I am not going to pay $80.00 annually to update it even if it is a legitimate deductable business expense. As near as I can tell TurboTax is useful for someone who is impatient, cannot read carefully, or is too lazy to just go to the IRS website, read the material, and perform the simple calculations and book-keeping necessary to file taxes."
92940,1,"The third installment of SPY Fox may have been my least favorite of the three, but it is still a phenomenal piece of children's gameplay. It is funny, creative, and vastly entertaining, even if the previous two were a bit lighter and quirkier. The jokes are humorous to children and adults alike, and I recommend it to anyone--one of my favorite childhood memories."
85003,1,"I am an 'over-the-road' long haul truck driver. As such, mapping and routing is crucial to doing my job well. I actually use 4 different mapping programs (3 of them run on one gps receiver, the other is a stand-alone). It is totally possible to enter the same data into each program and come up with 4 different routes. But that usually doesnt happen. I do get minor discrepancies between them at times. Of the laptop/desktop programs, the Delorme Street Atlas (SA) is by far the best. Having said that, I will admit that it is NOT intuitive to use at first. MS-Streets and Trips (SNT) is easier to use out of the box and for simple short trips. However, after taking the time to beat the learning curve on SA, it is a far superior product than SNT. The third program that I have is a terribly expensive product designed to be used by truckers. It is useless for the most part. I only consult it if I have concerns about truck restricted roads or bridge clearances. They all have mapping errors in them. They cannot possibly keep up with all the road building that goes on, and must rely on input from users. I dont believe that many people take the time to report errors or changes. There is also a considerable lag time from when the map data is created and the software vendor issues the product. So yes, when you buy the latest version, it is already months out of date.I am not sure where they get the data for commercial points of interests. In my opinion, I think many places have to pay for the 'advertising', thus if they choose not to, they wont appear. It was frustrating when I was attempting to find a local post office and the data was for a mailbox location. Again, the management and collection of this type of data is an impossible task,they must rely upon the veracity of the data that is supplied to them. Think of what it would cost to send someone to each and every POI to verify the information, and as well collect new data on new resturants, etc. We wouldnt be able to afford such a conveniece.My advice to you is this, If you are a casual user in familiar areas, consider the dedicated units such as tom-tom or garvin or delphi. I dont believe that you get much by paying a higher price. I wouldnt spend more than a couple of hundred dollars. I would also look for refurbished units. They will give you the best price. Often, they are units returned to stores because the user changed his/her mind. Neither the store nor manufacturer can resell the item as new. There is nothing wrong with it and it will have the same warranty as a brand new one. They are all about the same, though I did like my Delphi unit better than the device I use now that runs Tom Tom. I would stick with the major brands, I just dont trust the no-names. A larger screen is about the only good reason to spend more money.If you are a heavy user, one who is likely to have a laptop in your vehicle with gps, get both SA and SNT. Get the GPS receiver from Delorme. Then go to their website and download a free small program (called a serial port emulator)that will allow SNT and other programs to use the same receiver. For quick and easy routes use SNT. Use SA for your GPS monitoring. Compare the routes between the two products. If they are not the same, make a decision according to your preferences. You will find it much easier to manipulate your route in SA than in SNT.And finally, my best advice to you, is to secure the device that you are using. The most popular item to steal from a car today is a GPS device. Remove it from you windshield, including the bracket. It is also a good idea to clean the windshield so that the ring mark left by the suction cup on the bracket doesnt advertise that you have and use a GPS device. A bother you say! Yep, it is! But not as much bother as having to deal with the result of your car having been broken into and stuff stolen from you! And please -- when passing me on the road wave with more than one finger (I go slow because I have to and it saves on fuel)and give plenty of room before you move back into the lane. At highway speeds it takes me 3 football fields to bring my truck to a panic stop. I dont want to have to live with the fact that I killed someone because the driver of the other vehicle was ignorant or in just too big a hurry."
90123,1,"Excellent, highly polished OS, and a nice update for Mac users.Standard price is a little steep, but if you can fit this into budget, it's well worth it."
53512,1,"Mandrake has done it again. As far as home-use distributions are concerned, this wins hands-down. Installation is automated or highly configurable - either way it's smooth as glass. Post installation it just keeps getting better. There is no better hardware support with any distribution available today. This release supports most HP USB printers! Star office 5.2a, kernel 2.2.14 - I challenge anyone to find a more stable, easy to set up and use, rock solid distribution than this one."
35288,2,"Peter Norton was the savior of many a computer user and consultant. There were few programs that I absolutely depended upon more than Norton Utilities but somewhere between 2002 and 2004 that all changed. The program was probably rewritten from scratch to accommodate Windows XP.After Peter Norton sold it to the ""slicks"", the ""meat"" started disappearing, but it still worked ... sorta. Code bloat became really ugly and new versions often had only cosmetic differences. The worse that happened before 2003 was that some very useful aspects of it such as the hardware diagnostics and disk editing modules were pulled with neither explanation nor alternative offerings.Now it no longer works well. I have had many a virgin installation crash and worse than that:1 - You could not reinstall it2 - You could not uninstall it3 - Norton wanted $35 before they would even talk to you even if you had only had the product for a half hour4 - You could not get a refund5 - and the mail in rebate for the overpriced version, well let's not even go there!Norton produced serveral little fix it tools. I did not use them all but the ones I did use did not work completely. They cleaned up some of the problems but not them all. Since then, to solve the problems it has caused, I've either had to spend a few hours of registry editing or wipe the machine and restart.I do not believe that Symantec hires only incompetent programmers. I do believe that the company is probably run by shortsighted stockholders who know nothing about the business but only want to maximize the bottom line. Squeezing out highly competent and probably expensive employees has resulted in a dramatic decrease in product quality. Once again short term gains will kill a once valuable product. There are many quality alternatives that I'll look over while listening to the death knell increase in intensity of a ex-industry leader."
74984,1,"You have to commit to this program, at LEAST 2 hours a day, or you won't learn anything. If you are commited to learning a new language and have the time to sit down with the program, Rosetta Stone is a great way to go. There is no english at all throughout the program~ You will have to use a translation method if you don't understand the meaning of a word by the clues/pictures provided.Grab a pen and paper, memorize, speak, and learn a new language."
42408,1,"Great product, but rather complex for inexperienced users to master easily. This especially true with the Publisher and Access suites. On the other hand, as users gain experience, the package provides features and options which are very helpful - even if they are not used very often.It would be great if such products were so designed that users did not have to go on specialised courses to quickly gain proficiency."
52558,0,"I wasn't too sure if I wanted to switch from Quicken to MS Money, so I downloaded the trial from Microsoft's website ...As a recent user of Quicken, I wanted to see if Money was worth shelling out for my new, home-built PC. Being on a LAN, it was a relatively quick download. Installing it was where the interesting stuff began.Money doesn't let you run the first-time-setup wizard more than once. I had two credit cards and one checking account, and I didn't have the latest statements handy when I was installing it. So when I tried to modify my accounts later on, I was completely bemused. In comparison, my Quicken program lets me run a wizard each time I want to add an account--great when I got a new credit card after installing the program.Money also does something I don't like--it adds a lot of shortcuts to your desktop--at least three at last count. It also added a sort of ""Live Money"" taskbar button. I don't know what other people tend to do, but all I want in a financial program is finance tracking. I want to see where my money went and whether I'll have enough money at the end of the month, without having to log onto 3 different websites and doing some math. I don't want my financial program to link itself to my MSN Passport and connect to MSN Money unless I tell it to, and sadly, Money doesn't tell me that I have a choice in the matter.I suppose if I were more inclined to fiddle around with the settings, sooner or later I would find a way to turn it off. But I would prefer to be asked before it's done. Just a quibble.Money's pretty, and offers a lot of intergration with MSN Money if you like that sort of thing. It's sort of unfamiliar eye candy, but worth a look. And with the rebates [offered], it's much cheaper than Intuit's offering. That said, I still prefer Quicken for quick familiarity and the layout's ease-of-use. Let's not make me take a class just to learn to use my financial software, Microsoft. Good job, but you can do even better."

53801,1,"In New York Finnish language courses are hard to come by. I have been trying to teach myself to read, speak and hopefully write Finnish for years so I could speak with my cousins and grandmother overseas. It was a daunting task because books left me uninspired and tapes just don't work for me. Finally as a last ditch effort I took a chance on this program. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the program actually makes the process of learning language fun. The program and quizzes are colorful and engaging and manage to combine, listening, reading, understanding and speaking into one fun exercise. I have progressed with this program 100% faster than with the methods I've tried before. I definitely recommend this program to anyone who would like to start learning Finnish.For those who are a bit more advanced or are anxious to get to the next level the Intermediate level for this program is World Talk Finnish."
36345,1,I've just spent my first 15 mins with this CD and I must tell you it is amazing. This is how a language should be taught. The method is absolutely revolutionary. This really is how we must have learned language as children. Try it and I think you'll be very pleased.
86651,1,I thought I would use a program to type this review. I can only type about 20 words a minute at best. Overall compared to prior editions I own which were 4.0 and 7.0 this is a vast improvement. It is a little bit quirky but I believe a lot of that is because I have this on Windows VISTA as opposed to windows XP.If you type less than 20 words per minute I think this is an excellent program. Certainly if you can type more than 40 words per minute you will have to wait until they come out with version 11.0.
84451,1,"After reading all the reviews of this product here, I was a little nervous about installing this, but I'm aware that virus protection is important, especially if you have a business or other key info on your computer. After reading the reviews, I decided to go with the CD-ROM box version rather than a download from the internet, as a few people noted problems with downloads. I did all of the steps the installation noted, including creating an Emergency Disk set and Rescue Disk set of floppies as the installation instructed (NOTE: this took 10 1.44Mb disks, so I'd advise having these around during installation if you choose to create these disk sets). Everything installed well, and the program went to the internet and downloaded update files. After a simple reboot the software scanned my entire system, which took over an hour (I have 2 hard drives, one 20Gig and one 10Gig, with over 110,000 files). The program noted one infected file in my AOL Instant Messenger folder and corrected the problem. The virus scan seemed to hang up for awhile when it found this file, but with a little patience the scan finally continued on with no problems. You can choose how active you want the program to be, whether you want to schedule virus scans or do them on your command, whether the program should be active or inactive, continual internet updates or on-command, etc. I noticed the slightest drop in system performance, but I'd recently installed another 128 meg of RAM and this more than made up for the slight decrease in computer speed. Anyway, this program seems to work well for me with no problems, and I'm satisfied. By the way, I'm running Windows 98 on a PIII600 processor."

57291,1,"Maptech produces the best mapping software I've ever used. I've tried the rest, now I stick with the best. Being a Geography major in college, and working in the mapping industry now, I've used all the others, but maptech is by far the best. Detailed topos, great overlays, outstanding GPS hookup, and the 3-D graphics are unbelieveable!!!!! For anyone in a mapping field, or anyone looking to spice up their outdoor adventures, you have got to get this software."
72579,0,"This is definitely a program for the computer savvy. When it worked for me it was great...I got around very bad viruses twice. However, the degree to which it dragged on my write capabilities (I have a 1.2gig processor, 500+ meg of ram), and seemed to bog me down when running multiple programs at once led to write errors and eventually the need to reformat what became a hopelessly fragmented drive. This on my main computer that suffered from some of the shutdown problems typical of Win98SE. On another computer which I use far more gently, usually keeping one program at a time open, it seems to be fine, though the constant humming of the hard drive is a distraction. My sense is that it should be installed on a very clean machine after full fragmenting, disk scans, etc. for the utmost protection. Unfortunately the documentation does not provide ample caveats and warnings about possible problems -- a feature it has in common with other Roxio software. I may try another install and be far more careful with disk maintenance -- should be done from dos or safe mode -- and shut down, but the jury is out for awhile because I use an excellent Mijenix program which allows me to easily go back to older system settings when things start to screw up. Careful backing up of files, virus checking and firewalling may provide ample protection for most users."
41543,1,"I like this game and think that it does a good job of teaching symbols that relate to sounds heard in words, rhyming and spelling three letter words. It is pretty basic and only covers rhyming and spelling. All the child needs to know how to do is point and click to play the game. Also, it usually does not take a child long to complete the entire game. I would recommend it for an average PreK-K and for students that are having problems with rhyming three letter words and spelling three letter words."

78571,1,"Home Design Quick &amp; Easy, Version 2.0, is not perfect software, but it's pretty darn good -- especially for the price!OK, so it doesn't contain some of the bells and whistles that packages like Punch have. And to be honest, I would really love to be able to print out a ready-made kit for constructing my own model of a home. And it would be great to have sophisticated tallying of materials, and totalling of their costs, and be able to flesh out the framing of the house, heating, plumbing, etc.But after reading disappointing reviews on the Punch! software (with many complaints along the lines of &quot;This would be great software if it actually worked&quot;), I'm glad for now at least that I went with this package instead. I'm not saying there aren't better packages out there, but at under $20, it fit my budget nicely. And if you've read enough reviews, you'll know that easy-to-use home design software that actually does what it's supposed to is nowhere near as common as one would hope.HDQ&amp;E actually IS both (relatively) quick and easy to use. In a matter of hours, I had converted a 2-story home plan I saw online into my own customized version. Start with the short tutorial but be aware that you can do a lot more with this program than that. Once you're done designing, you can decorate the home and fill it with furniture. Give it a brick face. Change wallpaper and carpet. Add a table and chairs. And anything you can see on the screen -- floor plans with dimensions, aerial views, walkthroughs, a view of your dining room filled with furniture -- ALL of these you can print.It takes practice and thought to create odd shaped rooms with angles, but it CAN be done. Hint: Create a bigger room first, then overlay that with a small room on top. The program will automatically cut the angles out for you.It's not bug free. Save your work, especially before doing anything particularly taxing (like rendering). Several times the whole program has just vanished from my computer (266 MHz Pentium running Windows 2000). Once the walls stuck up through the roof (fixed by a bit of tweaking the settings). The aerial view printed with a bit of the back of the house chopped off. And I've had trouble with the roof on a porch. However, all of these are (in my opinion) relatively minor (and mostly fixable or work-aroundable) problems. All in all, it's easy to use, does a decent job of producing what you want it to, and at under $20 (I found it for $18 including shipping from Gateway) the price is DEFINITELY right.I give it 4 stars out of 5!"
54496,1,Writing a business plan is a daunting task for many people.

54973,0,"I'd give TurboTax a middle grade. I understand Intuit's concern about inappropriate copying, but I don't like the scheme they've chosen. On the other hand, I also think that they have gone some way to correct the worst parts of that scheme and I have seen no evidence of the alleged spyware aspects. The functional part of the software is basically good, but is not as easy to use as I'd like. I had one technical glitch, for which support was no help, and I really dislike chat-based support rather than primary free phone support.The copy protection would have been completely unacceptable to me if it had continued to be impossible to access forms mode on a computer other than the one activated for print/e-file, or if the need for activation/re-activation had not been changed to expire after October 15th (allowing printing of previous year's return from a new machine, for example). Otherwise, Intuit provided me enough information to know that if I wanted to work on one machine, then print off another, I needed to activate the software on the printing machine, then install on the working machine. I'm still not terribly happy about the memory footprint of the copy protection, which persists until actually uninstalled, whether I'm running TurboTax or not.The activation method (sending a random number, getting back a matched code) doesn't appear to qualify as spyware, and my firewall hasn't detected any unauthorized attempts by C-Dilla to phone home.The product itself is much as in past years, reasonably easy to use, occasionally maddening. (Just try to figure out where in the interview to go back and modify the amount of a moving expense reimbursement not reported on a W-2! I run into something like that every year.)The process to purchase and download state software (2 states) froze up after I'd authorized the purchase, but when I tried it a second time it recognized that I'd already paid and ran to completion, and I haven't been double-billed (so far; knock on wood!).For some reason, the explanatory videos are all silent in TurboTax on my computer, although when I play the .avi files directly using Windows Media Player, they're fine. I got a lot of useless advice via chat support (uninstall and reinstall all the multimedia components of Windows, keep uninstalling/re-installing TurboTax, etc.) and ultimately no help. As I said, I've had some issue with TurboTax for most every year of the 10 or so I've used the product, and being limited to chat support is EXTREMELY frustrating.(I don't have a CD-writer, so can't comment on any interference there caused by the copy protection.)All in all, a mixed bag!"
89787,1,This product was easy to install and meets my expectations.The Pinnacle software is a memory Hog.
33329,0,"I picked this up primarily to create mp3's off my old albums and cassettes. It works very well for this function, easily allowing the music to be recorded with different options. The ability to auto-remove pops (albums) and hums (cassettes) is very nice as is the audio enhancer where you can bump up the bass or midrange to make it sound better.Once you have the music loaded up your set of tools is quite limited. There is a terrific graphical method of cutting of the ends and fading in/out but thats about it. You do not have the ability to select a portion of the song and do anything like add echo or make it louder. You cannot cut and paste very easily, so for example, if you want to cut 5 seconds of silence out of the middle of a song the manual says to do so you need to load it up twice, use the fader and remove the front half, save it and then load the original, remove the back half, save it, then load both pieces and then cross-fade. If your planning to do much of anything with the songs after thay have been imported a different tool may be a better choice. I dropped it a star because I think cutting and pasting and selecting portions of music is a basic function that ought to be there.The drag and drop audio cd creation works very well, very intuitive and easy to use and worked flawwless on my computer. But its quite a bit slower than other tools I've used. A audio cd of 15 mp3 songs takes about 15-20 minutes to burn (even at 24x) which is not horrible but should be noted. A similar cd burned with other software takes about 5 minutes. I dropped it a star because of the speed.All in all a good tool for the basics of getting music into a computer, whether its coming from audio cd or analog format and then burning &quot;best-of's&quot;"
3005,1,"My daughter, who is six-years old, seemed to like Chester, but she LOVES Dinosaur Chess. The lesson plans are very well designed and the exercises are magnificently creative. Let me give you an example: in order to teach how the knight moves an exercise entails little mice that can eat you up, so you better move fast to the square marked with an X. Super!What makes this chess software different from others like Chessmaster is in its ability to gradually improve play strength as the student gets better. This is a very tricky problem. In other chess programs the chess engine either plays very strongly or very weakly. In Dinosaur Chess, while its internal chess engine gets calibrated for different labels, it adds another dimension to adjust strength: certain chess pieces are missing on the opponent's side depending on the level."
1762,1,"My husband and I used this on our road trip. My tech-gadget-crazed husband thought it was the coolest thing since sliced bread since it told us our speed, elevation and time left on our travel. We had no problems getting around. One small glitch in one of the directions it gave us - it told us to take exit 12B instead of 12A - but we figured it out immediately when it told us we were off route. This was just one bad direction among many good ones. We chalked it up to recent construction."

4593,1,"Pinnacle Instant CD+DVD is by far one of the best programs I have ever used. Nero is also very good. Pinnacle Instant CD+DVD is very informative while you are burning a CD. Much more informative than Nero or Easy CD Creator. The graphical interface is very similar to that of Easy CD Creator's, this one, is much better though. This Program Easily allows you to burn Data and Audio CD's, DVD's, and just about anything else you can think of. If you are looking for a good Burning Program, look no further than Pinnacle Instant CD+DVD."

However, the simpleist remedy is to go to Cnet.com and search for the update software and download for free. :)You WILL be suprised by how many viruses it finds the first, second, and third time you use it.

I have followed countless advice from them using regdelete to remove the software completely twice and reinstalling with no avail. The third try they took me through an extra step after reg delete and guess what? all my projects are now gone too. (except the ones saved to avi.) The program is wonderful when it works. Highest accolades when that becomes possible. Till then...I'm shopping
5354,2,"I bought Money 2004, and I'm starting from scratch - not upgrading from anything. Windows XP professional on a 1 year old Dell with 500 megs Ram.When installing the program I got an error about Norton AntiVirus preventing Money from connecting to banks, and it said to click the More Info button. The button opened a web page that did not list this error. I had to call Tech Support to install the program and they said I may have to call again if I have trouble connecting to Banks.I spent 3 long solid days setting up my budget and catagories and paying my 1st 3 bills. With all the videos and many kinds of help, the screens were not very intuative for just the basics of how to set up a budget and catagories and writing checks. I have not even tried the advanced things like balancing your check book or setting up a portfolio.I had problems setting up my Budget. I get paid every two weeks and video shows you how to set up your paycheck so it knows your gross pay as well as putting your deductions into catagories. My problem is that all reports show my annual gross pay as the wrong amount. I get paid ever 2 weeks which the program lets you enter. Thus there are 26 pay checks per year. The reports show the total income as 25 checks per year which is a very significant error. I tried increasing the date range of the budget, thinking it was chopping off one pay period since the 1st pay check is on 1/6/04. This does not fix the problem. I've had 3 Tech Support calls on this issue and they have not resolved this issue yet. They now admit there is a bug that prevents the annual income from your paycheck, and the budget column total from being correct. This is the basics folks, and it's WRONG!!!Reports do not show what you want to see. After setting up my Budget with budgetted amounts for each Catagory, I wanted to print a report so I could see my Budget. The only report like this prints the budget but also prints 2 columns for each month of the year. If only fits 2 months on a page so a simple 2 page report prints out as 12 pages! And I did not want any months at all. Customizing the report does not fix this problem.After spending lots of time looking at the 6 kinds of HELP it provides and not finding answers, I went to the Microsoft Web site to look in their Knowledge Base. As of 2-1-04, you can not search the database for Money 2004. It only goes up to Money 2003.I'd ask for my money back, but after spending all this time getting it set up, I'm going to live with it.Don't waste your money on Money 2004"
82164,1,"I have the multi-language version of this software, which includes Spanish, Italian, French and German. So I'm reviewing each single-language version as well so those shopping for language-learning software will know exactly what to expect from this.Before You Know It uses the flashcard method of teaching vocabulary four ways. Words and phrases are divided into lists by category. User selects a list then goes to the activity of choice to learn the contents of that list. There are a few more activities available in the Deluxe version that the free trial version doesn't have, but both versions use virtual flashcards the following way:Step 1 - Look at the foreign word and take a guess (out loud or in your head - it doesn't matter because the software trusts you to tell it if you answered correctly). The program will also say the word so you know the proper pronunciation.Step 2 - Look at the foreign word and type in it in English in the space provided. Here you don't get to cheat, because it can tell if your correct or not. The ones you need work on will repeat more often.Step 3 - Look at the English word and guess the foreign one. Again, it will trust you to be honest.Step 4 - Look at the English word and type in the foreign one. This has been the most helpful of all the steps for me, because not only do I have to know the word by now, I have to know how to spell it correctly and include any necessary accent marks.All of the above you can get with the basic version of Before You Know It that is available to download for free via the internet. Why not try it out before you purchase the deluxe version?With the deluxe version, you get more four more activities which include multiple choice, pronunciation practice where you can record your voice and compare your pronunciation with a native speaker (warning: software does NOT include a microphone), and dictation (which is just a repeat of step 4 of the flashcard portion).My favorite thing about this software, though, and what made me go ahead and spend the money for the deluxe version, is the user's ability to customize the program in several different ways:- User can add a word to any list. You just look up more words you want to know online or in a dictionary and add it to the appropriate category.- User can delete any word from any list.- User can copy any word from one list to another.- User can edit any word in any list. This is handy when studying Spanish because you might want to change the translation from European to Latin American.- User can create entire lists and categories of their own, add their own pictures and record their own voices to demonstrate the pronunciation of each word. You can create lists for anything you want to learn - not just languages.- User can download additional, free lists from the Before You Know It website, including state capitals, periodic table of elements (chemistry), multiplication tables, and more. And you can sign up for the free ""list of the week."" Each week, a new list will be sent to you via email.This software will help you master your foreign vocabulary and learn helpful phrases, but it does not teach the rules of grammar for these languages. You won't learn conjugation unless you look up the form of each word yourself and add it to their lists or create your own lists.In other words, the customizing possibilities for this are almost endless if you're willing and able to invest the time to do it. But what it comes with already installed is meant to simply increase your foreign vocabulary and, used alone, will not make anyone a fluent speaker."
37689,0,"This is a great tool for learning the language via immersion. Rather than teaching through a structural method in which the mechanics and vocabulary of any given language are laid out in an organized manner, with Rosetta stone you learn mostly through pictures and figuring things out on your own.This works really well as a means of forcing you to confront and use the language based on hearing, rather than reading, but I personally have found that it still works better as just a supplement to a more traditional structural textbook approach to learning the language. The Rossetta stone approach works great for stuff like learning vocabulary and basic phrases that any ""beginner"" to a foreign language will need, but when it comes to teaching more general rules of the language(i.e. things like conjugating verbs, feminine/masculine/neuter nouns and pronouns, etc, etc) the method is kind of lacking. There were many times that I found myself having to consult textbooks to figure out quite a few of the language's nuances in a much more direct manner than Rosetta Stone's method is able to provide.Which doesn't mean that it's a bad program, but for the price I was hoping that it would be comprehensive enough on its own that you wouldn't need too many supplements. I think it would be better if they would integrate the ""immersion"" approach that they use here (which is very effective in its own way), with the more traditional structural method of teaching foreign languages. This would allow you to move back and forth as needed and adjust the program to your own learning style. As it is, it's definitely a valuable tool, but I don't think its comprehensive enough to justify the price."
13659,0,"After using Bitdefender on trial .I discovered that Bitdefender was so imcompatible with ""First Defense-ISR ""a hard drive imaging software that has saved me from a lot of trouble over the years ,and that it disabled that software.Then trying Mcafee and Norton ,I became fed up with updating virus patterns that wouldn't update from Mcafee and installation problems with Norton which would'nt install.Having used Zone Alarm Pro for a number of years with excellent results .But reading some very scary reviews from readers about installation problems and resource hogging .I gritted my teeth and prayed a little then downloaded a trial version of Zone Alarm Security Suite ,expecting the worst .But lo and behold it installed flawlessly(this was a clean install)I updated the latest virus and spyware patterns without a hitch.Breathing a sigh of relief I proceeded to configure the software also doing a virus and spyware scan ,also without a hitch.After 2 days it became apparent that I was in possession of an excellent security suite and that I was in the clear as far as problems that some reviewers had experienced,I have to confess ,I breathed a sigh of relief and purchased the software as an upgrade to my Zone Alarm Pro.Also I was relieved that the tremendous slow down of my computer that I had experienced with Bitdefender,Mcafee and Norton had disappeared with Zone Alarm .In fact my computer has picked up quite a bit of speed.The one thing I'm not impressed with is the antispyware portion of this suite .After running a spyware scan on Zone Alarm ,then running another scan on Counterspy.I ran a deep scan on Ad-Aware SE and removed 13 more pieces of spyware 4 of them were critical .It doesn't hurt to run several antispyware scans with different software to try to get them all,however I always do the last scan on Ad-Aware and get all the other spyware that other software products has missed. I'm glad I bought Zone Alarm Suite though,it's everything I expected and hoped for in a security suite,and yes the pop up reminders will drive you crazy ,but after 3 years ,I'm used to it ."

Bit the bullet and bought this and have not regretted it since. The ability to work with Windows (or any other OS you install) while keeping Leopard running and running Mac programs simultaneously is amazing. All my friends not only love my new Mac but when I show them how Parallels works and that I can use two OS's at once they're amazed - it's truly like having 2 computers in one.HOWEVER - you MUST, MUST, MUST make sure you're constantly downloading the latest build of this product (it takes about 2 minutes). When I first installed Parallels those bugs I referred to earlier kept making it crash - after some quick research online I noticed that my Build version was not as up-to-date as it should have been and that I needed to download an update so that it could work seamlessly with Leopard. Sure, enough it worked. And the last time I booted up (last night) Parallels alerted me that there was an even newer Build available to download and everything is working even smoother. Latest Build is 5528.From what I've read Parallels is rushing to put the latest Build in the software when you purchase it (to avoid having to download updates) but it's been taking them some time to catch up b/c Leopard is relatively new and as users like me use Parallels with Leopard they're finding things that need fixing.HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT - works great and the ability to work in 2 OS environments at once is a dream come true."

I'm what you can call a coder, I like to know exactly what is written in the source code so that I can change it to my behalf.

The code dreamweaver generates is probably the best you can get using WYSIWYG web page builders.Fireworks is a graphics application almost totally directed to constructing and manipulating imagens for use in web pages.

The games are much too long for my son's attention span and I had to use the task manager to quit the program if when I wanted to leave without finishing the game.

Notes are missing and when it plays it squeeks some notes out.So, I tried it with a Tiff File, same thing.I then tried starting a new, blank sheet music and copying and filling in the notes, but for some reason the selection, copy keys don't seem to work.

The pace is too quick and my son (8) is permitted to move before he has really mastered the lesson. I am able to set the Words Per Minute higher but once he reaches that he is given another 4 keys at once. Although it seems he has mastered the lesson, only his short term memory has learned anything and any long term muscle memory has no chance to develop. Also, there is no way to go backwards and repeat a lesson to review so I have had to make my own worksheets in MSWord to cover keystrokes he is not competent in. This is a fun game for him after his normal keyboarding lesson but I will no longer use it as his instructor."

84255,1,"[...] First of all, anyone looking for an objective opinion should be aware that there are a lot of people out there with an agenda. Some of them are people who will whine about anything with the name Microsoft on it, and some are jealous and competitive Apple Nazis who should simply be ignored.With that out of the way, I've been using Vista Ultimate since it was released, and I'll try to give as much of an unbiased review as I can. I have it installed on a Dell laptop with a 2GHz processor and 2GB RAM.POSITIVES- Vastly improved appearance over XP.- Vastly improved use of system resources. Graphics are handled by the graphics processor, which combined with the addition of features like Superfetch and Readyboost (a brilliant feature which allows up to 4GB of flash memory to be used as a supplement to system memory) makes a much ""heavier"" system boot up and shut down faster than XP. Load times for commonly used applications are also dramatically reduced, using the same approach.- Reliable. I have not encountered a single bug in the OS in four months.- Many new features. On XP, I needed third party software for burning CDs and DVDs, watching DVDs, wireless networking and Bluetooth, just to name a few. All of these are included in Vista Ultimate, and work well enough that I don't need to install alternatives.- Improved security. It is now much harder for malicious code to execute on your system without your knowledge.- Bells and whistles. Aero, desktop gadgets, improved games (including chess), etc.NEGATIVES- The price. It is not cheap.- Lack of third party support. While I have not encountered problems with the OS itself, I have encountered a number of hurdles when it comes to third party software and drivers. Before upgrading, it is essential to check that software or hardware that you rely heavily upon is supported in Vista, or that there is a good alternative available. Many developers are still wed to XP, and have been moving at a snail's pace when it comes to upgrading their products to support Vista. It so happens that my key programs and hardware are all supported now, so for me it has been a good move.- Learning curve. Microsoft has made a bit of a departure (welcome and long overdue from my perspective) from their previous approach of tailoring their products to the lowest common denominator of novice computer users. If you are not at least an intermediate user, you are likely to encounter some things that may confuse you, like the prompts when you try to install software or run certain programs. They are no big deal for someone with moderate computer knowledge, but for those who are technically inept, it could be frustrating. A good ""Vista for Dummies"" type of book may be useful.SUMMARYFor me, the upgrade has been a big positive. Vista is better than XP in almost every way, and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone, with the following exceptions:- If you have an old machine that can't handle it.- If you are a computer novice (although you will probably eventually have to take the step one way or the other).- If you rely on programs or hardware that are currently not supported.Overall, the best analogy I can think of to describe the move from XP Pro to Vista Ultimate would be moving from a solid but unremarkable economy car to a well-built luxury sedan with a lot of extra features. There are some trade-offs, but it vastly improves your overall PC experience. More than anything it makes using your computer, especially for long periods of time, much more enjoyable, which is a big accomplishment."

91821,0,"I've had this software about two weeks, and I do agree with the points made by the lady from S.C., and wanted to mention some other things. It is heavy on templates and pages for babies or small children, so if you aren't scrapping for kiddies, you're very limited here. I cannot see that it has 1200 of anything, though I could be wrong. They may be counting every tiny flower or color block to arrive at that number. And there are only a few 12 x 12 templates, I would say less than 10%. Not that I have access to a 12 x 12 printer, but I would have liked to have that option. And when you start to print anything, it does not give you the option of making a layout, or printing multiples on a page to make the best use of expensive Canon photo paper, and when I chose a 5 x7 size to print, it yielded a finished product more like 4x6, so it is a matter of trial and error to get sizing right. Printing on plain paper yields flat, 2D pages and I didn't like them at all, I haven't tried cardstock yet. If you are into 3D looks, you might consider a better software. Regarding the quality of the templates, there are some very cute designs, but most were not my choice of style or design, as I said, more for children. I would say the percentage I will use is about 25% (generous estimate) There are templates for scrapbook pages (quite a few of those) frames (only a few) diaries/journal (a very few) And each type is divided into baby, general, holiday, birthday, seasonal, etc, so each category has only a handful. If you don't like the one page for Halloween, for example, you're out of luck! And the fonts, well, I have tons of fonts already installed on my computer. If you know how to use Windows to install more fonts, or if you have any other design software, you already have these fonts anyway. Maybe Hallmark is counting the one or two of their own here, but basically you probably already have them. I have used Sierra Print Artist for years and there is much more to it than this software (though Print Artist has a lot of cheesy designs, but you have thousands of things to choose from on Print Artist!)Having said all that, and given the negatives, it is very easy and intuitive to use, the software that any novice should be able to use. And it is easy to import your own photos from your files and simply click on the empty photo frame, and viola! your photo is there in the frame on the page. That easy! So it takes no time to finish a page quickly. I did a baby page in about two clicks of a mouse and it looked pretty good, on photo quality paper (I seriously doubt if any other paper would look good, and I have a good Canon photo printer)In conclusion, if you are a beginner when it comes to using design software, and especially if you are going to be scrappin' for kiddies....it's worth the money and you will probably really like this software. I plan to keep it just for the ease of use and the few templates that I liked. I do wish Hallmark would take this user-friendly technology and give us something with many more options and design features. Perhaps in the future."

I found the Childbirth software, and I thought it would begreat to be in bed with my laptop. This software seems able to provide information about any problem you have concerning childbirth, the post partum period, and baby feeding. They even provided birth announcements you can design yourself. I love it!"
20045,1,"Oz the Magical Adventure is a wonderful educational trip down the yellow brick road. My mom bought this game for my autistic brother and he loves it. The games are entertaining, the characters are wonderful and the animation is highly enjoyable.This adventure puts you into the story of ""The Wizard of Oz"". But something has gone terribly wrong. The Wicked Witch has sent one of her flying monkeys to capture Dorothy and Toto. As Dorothy and Toto are carried away from the yellow brick road Glinda the good witch of the South appears to tell the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and the Lion to keep going to the Emerald City. Once in the throne room of the Emerald City, the Wizard of Oz tells the three companions he will grant their wishes if they rescue Dorothy, kill the Wicked Witch, and bring Dorothy back as proof. He gives you a medallion which will open the door to the witches castle. It's missing nine jewels. The jewels are hidden all around Oz. Your objective now is to help the Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Lion find the jewels and get to Dorothy and Toto. Now it's up to you to save Dorothy, Toto, and all of Oz from the Wicked Witch of the West.This game is based on the original book ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" by L. Frank Baum, not the movie with Judy Garland. The game brings out characters from the book, characters from other Oz books, and new characters that are equaly lovable. You must journey with the Tin Man, Sacarecrow, and Lion to locations in Oz such as the Land of the Munchkins, the Land of the Winkies, and the Country of the Quadlings. In each land there are three games. Between each land there are mini games. Some are to transport you between the lands and some are for plain entertainment and don't have any purpose other than that. There are 15 games total.The games all teach basic logic and directions. For example: In the Land of the Munchkins you must help a juice lady to recover her memory that the wicked witch has stolen. You must listen to her instructions to make a fruity drink that will help her recover and she might be able to tell you where a jewel is hidden. In the land of the Quadlings you must set the water pipes right or the jewel will be stuck. To reset the pipes you need to dircect the colored pipes in different directions so the water will flow the right way.The games are very educational and entertaining. The animation is brilliant. It really brings Oz to life. The Lion, Tin Man, and Scarecrow are always at your side and interact with you so you're never alone. Before each game starts you can select levels (Bronze: Easy, Silver: Medium, Gold: Hard). And after each game you can either quit or choose another level and start over. The game really makes you feel like you've fallen into the book and met all the characters. Me and my mom taught my brother how to play each game. He eventually learned to play the games all by himself. We're hoping he will soon progress to the next level. This game provides really good challenges for 4-8 year olds. The game is always changing so it doesn't get boring quickly. I highly recommend it.So put on your magic slippers, grab your basket, get your dog, and head down the magical yellow brick road for an unforgetable journey through Oz."

32012,1,"This product is easy to use. Why are the directions so difficult to wade through? I ended up calling customer service, after reading the printed material and searching the CD materials. The major hangup was getting past the little popup window inside the folder with the product icon: When you open it, a popup asks for your name, the serial number and your phone number, as I recall. I thought this was the product registration page, which I postponed doing to continue my search for the directions. Had I filled in the registration material and hit ""continue,"" I'd have finished calibrating my monitor and hour and a half sooner. The customer service rep said, ""Yeah, you have to sort of put two and two together."" A simple note on the registration page saying: ""Do this first or we'll never let you get to our directions"" would have been very helpful. Overall, the printed directions need work. By the way, the product is great. At last, my prints look like what's on my monitor."

26912,0,"I've been a user of both Roxio Easy CD Creator and Nero 6 Ultra, and both of these products have severe limitations that make them inferior for anything but your basic burning of tracks to CDs. If you want a product that rips, edits, and burns CDs with lots of options and ease of use, then you can really do no better than get Blaze Audio. Blaze Audio is a fully functional integrated program with many professional features. For example, there are no limits in mixing. In Easy CD Creator, for example, you are limited to a maximum 30-second mix between tracks. There is no such arbitrary limitation with Blaze Audio. As a matter of fact, with Blaze Audio you can stick one track inside another by just pointing your mouse to the location in the tract you want to insert the other tract, press mix, select the other track, and voila, there it is. Nothing could be easier. Blaze Audio also has equalizing, normalizing, volume control, and all the features you could wamt in a rip and burn CD program. I no longer use Easy CD Creator or Nero. Blaze Audio is so much easier to use than the other two and I unhesitatingly recommend Blaze Audio highly over both Easy CD Creator and Nero. Yes, Nero is better than Easy CD Creator, but even Nero doesn't compare to what Blaze Audio has to offer. The people at Blaze Audio obviously know what they're doing and have designed a program that is both full-featured and intuitively easy to use."
46409,1,"This piece of software is what I have been hoping for for since I bought my machine. It is the most elegant and detailed mapping system that I have used. With the Garmin Vista Cx it works flawlessly. You can download any or all of the map data from the disks into the ""Topo"" file and it runs very well on my powerbook G4. It will upload all waypoints, and routes. It will download all waypoints, routes and tracks! The maps are gorgeous! The interactive web feature is cool but young. It has a geocaching feature. The 3d maps are sweet! It downloads updates and new map layers almost perfectly (had to manually download the software update). I only wish that waypoints symbols would transfer to and from my unit but I can easily live without them. Load the Mapsource maps to your device (Garmin ""x"" series saves to swappable memory microSD cards) and use Topo! from your laptop."

90803,1,"I have been using MS Publisher since the early 90's. I have never really gotten into the other ""Office"" products. My computer crashed and I lost the 07 version, and since it was enough for me at this time, I didn't see the practicality of 2010 version at a higher cost, I will probably upgrade at a later date. I have created directories, cookbooks, business and recipe cards, and miscellaneous other documents. I LOVE it! It is a MUST-HAVE for me. I would be lost without it."
51864,1,"I agree 100% with the previous reviewers in the fact that OpenOffice, Firefox, and the other main packages are rich in features and of a very good quality. Even if Microsoft stuff would be free of charge, I'd prefer these packages 10 to 1 over Microsoft, precisely because of quality.Now, the main point I want to make is, that if you have more than one computer, let's say three as I have at home, savings will add up very quickly. For example, just talking about MS Office: each license for each computer is $400+. To be perfectly legal you should buy 3 licenses x $400 = $1,200 (or more). With Open Office you won't spend more for one, than you'll spend for 3, or 20, because it's open source. Under the General Public License, you could install it on an unlimited number of computers, and remain perfectly legal. So, the only Microsoft product my wife and daughter are running on their respective computers, due to compatibility issues with the local school district, is Windows 98SE, but everything else is open source, including Open Office, Firefox, and Thunderbird. Of course, all machines are dual boot with Linux Open Suse 10.0, which in my case is the one that I use almost exclusively.BTW, just if you're considering getting rid of Microsoft products altogether, you can get Linspire 5.0, Suse 10.0, or any other major Linux distro, and you'll be amazed that all of these applications and much, much more, come included. You'll be a happy camper in a world of freedom!"

Only racing around trying to follow a wiggly 3d arrow and go from place to place. After 10 minutes, I was stuck at the bottom of the ocean, and there was only one ramp to get out, it takes quite a while to find the ramp. Ultimately this game is boring, perhaps if it had easy, and hard modes it might be OK, but save your money, get a learning game instead."

I can do touchup on photos, add a wide variety of text, do newsletters, brochures, flyers, you name it.

Simple things like printing labels or an envelope is much easier in Office than iWorks. I'm not even sure you can print labels in Pages (iWorks version of Word). When I purchased iWorks i was under the impression that documents created in iWorks could be opened and edited with Office, they're not. Apple needs to work on making their products cross platform compatible. As far as Office for Mac, it's the best for everyday personal as well as professional use."

14181,1,"I'm a huge Sibelius fan, so when they came out with educational software for young children, and when I saw a demo of this, I had to get a copy for my nephews, ages 7 and 3. Both of them took to this program like I never expected they would. I got a call from my sister-in-law a few days after I delivered the software, and she was shocked, saying she couldn't get the kids off of the computer! (Finally... something got them away from the X-Box!) The greatest thing about this program is that it's equal learning and fun. It teaches the basic musical concepts in ways I never thought of, but ways in which today's technologically-savvy kids can relate and enjoy. I have to admit, I had WAY too much fun playing with it myself! It's sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy, but simple enough for kids to understand. I heard great things about this program on a television review ~ it was a first-place choice for children in a study of educational music software. Very cool, very fun, very educational. A great way to get your children started in music!!"
35188,1,"With the exception of one (big) negative, this has been a terrific upgrade. There is no doubt that this is an 'optimized' system, as my Mac G4 is blazing through things faster than ever. Standards like iPhoto and iTunes still put Apple on the cutting edge, but new features like Safari and the Dashboard/Widgets are great for making your life easier. So, what was the one big negative, you wonder? When I upgraded, my modem driver went AWOL. For four long weeks I was without internet access! Apple engineers worked hard to solve the problem (which was very rare, but I was not the only person to suffer from it), and Apple Tech Support people were fabulous about keeping me posted as to what was happening during my long wait (via phone since I didn't have email). Happily my 'puter is now fully up and running due to an upgrade sent from Apple, direct. Despite this *big* hassle, I have to say that I really like Tiger and I would definitely recommend it to fellow Mac users. The speed and ease of the operating system make it worth the money."
71746,0,"Star Trek Away Team, published by Activision, was an interesting premise gone awry. Personally, I like tactical games where stealth and planning are essential to mission completion. Heck, I just like building bases, preparing for an all-out assault and then blitzing my enemies as I throwing everything at 'em - which is why I like Blizzard's StarCraft and Activision's Star Trek Armada.To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of squad-based game play but I am a big Star Trek nut so I thought, this might be cool. Unfortunately, this game did little to change my original opinion. Set in the time of The Next Generation, sometime after the Dominion War, Away Team focuses on the exploits of Captain Marcus Reflian, commander of a small experimental starship, the USS Incursion, and his group of highly skilled, individually selected crewmembers and their goal to uncover a nefarious plot that threatens every major power in the quadrant, including the seemingly invincible Borg. Players must endure a linear progress through 17 missions. The locales of each mission change, bringing you to Starfleet Academy, aboard Federation starships, Q'onos, and Romulus. Even though the scenery changes game play does not. While in single player mode, you command on average, 4 Federation crewmembers you chose for each mission. Just after the mission briefing you must assemble your away team from the 17 crewmember choices. Each mission has specific skill requirement that must be met in order to meet the primary objective, such as the need for a medical officer (or someone with medical training) and/or a crewmember that is experienced in using the sniper rifle. Only after the skill requirements are met can you play the mission. You must choose your away team from each of the five Starfleet personnel divisions: Command, Engineering, Medical, Security, and Science. This does not mean you cannot ""double-up"" with your personnel. You can have two command officers, a science officer, and a security officer, for example, on your away team, if the skill requirements for that mission are met as you assemble your team. Each character has different skills and inventory items that will enable you to complete your missions.Game play is reminiscent of chess, as you, with your third person perspective, must maneuver your four man away team, step by step, through your scenario world. There are tactical elements involved such as using the sniper rifle to take out a sentry from a distance or you can sneak up on an opponent and rendered him dead or unconscious by phaser, hypospray, or even the Vulcan nerve pinch. However, this brings up two flaws to the game. Firstly, since subterfuge is vital to most missions, players must maneuver their away team to avoid detection by automated security posts or guards. This can make missions very long. In some cases I took over two and a half hours to complete one mission. Secondly, because you can move team members either one at a time or en masse, managing your team and their reactions can be difficult, as the Artificial Intelligence engine of this game is seemingly limited. For example, if one or any member of your team is attacked there will be no reaction unless you command that character, so you're sitting cursing at your team member as they let a Borg attempt to assimilate them. While in other cases you click on a spot where you want your team to walk to - to avoid enemies and they walk right into them, forcing you to start your mission over, as you were supposed to remain undetected for the course of the mission.Fan's of first person shooters were probably overjoyed when Star Trek: Elite Force came out and might hope that Away Team would bring more of that action to life, but unfortunately it does not. I hate to sound blasphemous against the Holy Franchise, but save your money for Dominion Wars.The Pros: Interesting storyline Voiceovers by Brent Spiner and Michael Dorn Decent graphicsThe Cons: Linear mission progression Action repetitive Mission time can be extensive Only two exciting cut scenes - the opening and closing Poor AI"
29775,1,"First let me say I have used lots of various programs over the past few years.Spydoctor is in my top 5.I headed up a malware team; before terms like malware, spyware and adware were even being used in the mainstream.1. My first program was XCLEANER by xblock, since it was one of the first ones for sale out there.It does a decent job, but I like it more as a ""bundle"" of utilities, than for it being a #1 rated in the anti-malware software utility.2. Webroot - For years I used Webroot's spysweeper and I still do on one of my pc's.Only thing I hate is that spysweeper dropped the ability to scan network shares.3. Counterspy - I also use Counterspy by sunbelt software.It and webroot go back and forth, both trading places for 1st place and 2nd place, in the anti-spyware category of software reviews.I like Counterspy slightly over webroot for one big reason; it STILL ALLOWS you to scan your home network ""shares"" or shared-drives.4. Spydoctor - My 3rd pc (old P3-600) has Spydoctor.Over the last Christmas holidays, I also installed Spydoctor for a family member, on their pc.(It found several ""pests"" that the family member's own ISP-provided anti-spy software had missed).5. Zone alarm - not as polished as webroot or counterspy, but getting better.6. mcafee- getting better, but has a ways to go yet, before webroot or counterspy have to start worrying.Okay, I mentioned how Counterspy and Spydoctor still scan shared drives.For a home network, it is great to have the ability to connect to your other family member PC hard drives (or shares) and scan them once a week with a ""different"" scanner product.Webroot dropped the feature in it's home/consumer product.Counterspy and Spydoctor still have it.--------------------[NOTE: anti-virus scanners only allow one product per pc or else they start to walk all over each other, and/or not even work.Anti-spyware software tends to allow you to load MORE THAN ONE anti-spyware program, but you shouldn't.Here is why.Most antispyware programs are like anti-virus programs, IN THAT they too load real-time background scanners.And I have yet to see TWO of them running at the same time WITHOUT causing problems, and/or slowing even a speedy dual core down to the speed of a 386 pc].Anyway, from my own observations; no ""single"" anti-spy scanner program detects every malware out there.So, it doesn't hurt to scan each other's pc, across a family LAN.Anyway, if your anti-spyware program allows network share connections, you simply connect to your other pc's on the home network and start scanning.[Example: You scan your pc, then you connect to a network share for your spouse's pc and scan their computer, and to your kid's and scan theirs.They in turn could do the same.Having they ability to do network share scans is why I still like Spydoctor.Just my 02 cents."
32022,1,"I found the Spyder2Pro to be overall, an easy product to use ... although it did take some doing, and a bit of time, to get the calibration device to sit flat on my notebook screen. I would say that was a big downside to using this device. I also did not see much of a difference (if any) in the before and after screen, after calibrating my monitor ... I have one other notebook computer (a smaller VAIO which is my take-out-in-the-field computer), but have not yet taken the time to calibrate this one to see if there is a difference."

I was given incorrect information that the Leopard would load to my Tiger. The program downloaded to my Mac Tiger without problems. However, when I tried to download the current upgrades, my computer crashed. I completed the process about four times then took it to the Mac Store for a Mac Genius to check. It was determined that my poor little tired Tiger could not handle this upgrade; that it was too old and therefore the information I had been given was incorrect for my circumstances. So, the wonderful people at Mac restored my Tiger to its previous working condition. I am giving my wonderful Tiger to my grandson for his use in grammar school. I purchased a new Snow Leopard for myself and all is well in my world once again.Cannot rate the product but can rate the service. I was very pleased with the ordering and purchasing process through Amazon.com and The Selling Raj, and I look forward to future business with you. Thank-you."

In the last 10 years I've had all sorts of stock and price information stored in Quicken, some of it entered daily. I got a little nervous when I read the bad reviews listed on this site. But you should not be nervous! All my data transferred instantly and Quicken 2004 works beautifully without any glitches. In my years of owning Quicken products I've never had to call customer support so it doesn't bother me that they charge by the minute. Most of these other Quicken users probably have problems with their operating systems and other glitches. The only time quicken didn't work right was when I had bugs in the system software. Purchase a couple of good utility programs and everything in your computer will run fine! Don't be afraid to buy this product."

The only problem - the instruction book has print too small for the deteriorating eyesight of old people, but that is certainly not the fault of Amazon. I am more than satisfied."
69678,1,This game gets Drew back on track.The puzzles are not as difficult as Scarlet Hand.No slide puzzles Yeah!You get to go outside and explore and go to others places around the lake.So there is more to explore and a little creepier.Well worth the money.The story and characters are better developed than the last two.So go and buy it before the next one is released.The next Nancy goes to a haunted Carnival.OOOHH!!
14040,1,What a great suite of products. I have a new employee that I just started on Coreldraw 12 and within 2 weeks he is loving it! I have used the product since version 1 and highly recommend it to someone who needs a easy to use and also a professional suite of products that will get anything from business cards to billboards done!
55989,0,"This game is pretty fun at first, but it gets old very fast. You are called to do a certain task around the island, which is cool, until you get through the tasks and do the same ones over and over again. The only part I thought was real good about this game was the exciting car race. But compared to the other Lego PC games, this is quite boring."
47647,0,Ski Resort Tycoon is exactly what the name implies - build a mountainside ski retreat and try to attract the most business.Performance was perfect. Any computer out today shouldn't have problems running this game. Despite the fact that it's older I had no issues under Windows XP. If you have problems try shutting off background programs like virus scanners.Pros+ Easy to use interface and straightforward explanations+ Neat feature to view resort from building cameras+ good tools and utilities to map out resortCons- dated graphics and terrible sound (to be expected)- very limited selection of buildings and upgrades- tutorial is short and doesn't cover very muchOverall... decent sim game but very limited in scope and appeal. The clunky graphics and sound take away from the game (in my opinion). When compared to Rollercoaster Tycoon and Zoo Tycoon the weakness of Ski Resort is obvious.
41063,1,"This is really nice for editing pictures for websites and such, but the web page wizards refuse to work for me saying that I need to insert CD 2 and when I do it still won't work. The button maker creates buttons that are way to large for use on any webpage, but all in all I am very happy with it. I have turned out some very nice edited JPG's and I am glad I spent the money for it."
87489,0,"First, if you have Streets & Trips 2004 and don't use GPS, don't bother upgrading.Streets & Trips 2005 handles GPS far better than 2004. HOWEVER, there is a price. When using the GPS tracking features, the processor on my 1 GHz laptop with 512 MB memory maxes out. There is NO reason for this. I also have the DeLorme Earthmate GPS with StreetAtlas. There is almost NO performance hit when using GPS with this software. Also, the DeLorme software has a verbal directions option which is very handy when driving alone.Unfortunately, neither software package is perfect. Streets & Trips is much more user friendly and far smarter when creating driving directions. DeLorme has verbal directions, more options and abilities with a GPS, and has a minimal processor hit.Personally, I will most likely keep both on my laptop and use them in conjunction with each other. If you don't like or don't have this option, choose what's more important to you."

62936,1,If you only need to print to a PDF there are free products available. Unfortunately we need to scan to PDF's and there are not any less expensive options available. The product does all of the basic PDF manipulation and OCR.
85140,1,"This is the best game yet!!! I love how you can feed them, pet them, dress them. It's like owning a real dog! My brother makes fun of me cuz i get so into it, he always says ""its not like there real"" but they are!! They have feelings ya know!If you love dogs, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you BUY this GAME!!!!!! If you don't, your really missing out!! THIS IS AN EXCELLENT GAME!!"
25346,1,"This product makes an excellent companion for the other JASC products, most notably, Paint Shop Pro. It provides easy to use, intuitive tools that can make dramatic adjustments in digital photos without having to take a course in photo editing. Included are red-eye reduction, framing options, easy resizing, photo gallery and html support, and a host of other utilities. While not nearly as comprehensive as its big brother, it nevertheless contains some shortcuts that JASC should have included in PSP. The batch processor makes resizing and format changing a snap for galleries of multiple images. No, it won't replace PhotoShop or PSP, but it does produce some quick-and-dirty editing capabilities."
10839,0,"The graphics are minus nil compared to games today but I played it when I was little so there was a lot of sentimental value to me. However, if your into Lego games, your defiantly going to love this one."
78127,1,"This product is definitely better than the previous versions and Macromedia Studio has proved itself to be one of the best web designing software tools on the market. Although this is a pretty handy product for web designers, it still needs improvement. For example, dreamweaver puts all those nasty tags that will be very difficult to debug later on if you get into problems with Mac Computers (Especially Mac IE). Also the price is pretty high although you can get a student version for cheap. Photoshop is still better than Macromedia's products for image processing. So should you buy or upgrade to this product? Upgrade yes, buy only if your company pays for it or if you don't want to spend too much time designing websites and don't care what they look like in Mac computers."
17160,1,"Setting aside the licensing (bundling with/without various OS configurations), pricing (continuing upgrades), and performance issues compared to older versions (if you have a G5, you don't have a choice), VPC 7.0 is, without doubt, one of the handier tools you can have in your software arsenal.As long as you have plenty of disk space (to create the virtual PC hard discs) and plenty of available RAM (the more you can allocate to the guest system, the better), it's practically as good as having a second PC without the hardware.Some of the niftier features include:- ability to 'grab' floppy/CD images without having the actual physical media (use runtime Linux OS iso images without having to actually install, test out BeOS to see what OS X could have been like, etc.)- ability to run multiple OS environments without having to disrupt your existing OS X environment (reboot, shutdown, reset your virtual machine with a click)- saved state of guest OSes so you don't have to shut down and can pick up from where you left offSome caveats:- installation of guest OSes can sometimes be painfully slow, especially on slower Macs- while Windows OSes seem to be OK, running alternative operating systems such as Linux will have trouble syncing system time after restoring from saved state- less than ideal PC performance for any high-end computing (especially compared to Virtual PC 2004 on Windows which is quite fast)"
52509,1,"It is only a couple of days I am using this software so I just want to add something that nobody said so far.Like another user I am still using PocketMoney for Palmand I gave MsMoney a try because I got it for nearly nothing...I red some negative comments about the management of a Flexible Spending Account but I was able to set it up manually.Automatic update with banks/financial institutions? Not too bad: unfortunately my AmEx Corporate is the only one that is not part of the integration, my 401(k) account (Principal) neither. Yes, you can still download a file to import but still... I guess the more users there will be around the more Microsoft and banks will collaborate. The integration with ING Bank or Wachovia is great.Finally one thing that somebody else said: it is TOTALLY customizable."
92050,1,"Previous versions of Red Hat left much to be desired, but with each successive release this distribution has gotten better. In my opinion, Red Hat 7.3 is now the best distribution available yet - easy to configure, robust, and full featured.I installed RH 7.3 on my finicky Inspiron 3800 Laptop. Every other time I have installed Linux (or any other operating system) I had to download drivers for the sound card, for the video card, or other peripherals. Not with Red Hat Linux 7.3. It detected and configured my sound card without any intervention. My PCMCIA ethernet card was also automatically configured.KDE 3.0 is included, and is robust. A slew of new applications are included, allowing you to FAX, scan, edit, run spreadsheets, produce presentations, and just about anything else you could think of - right &quot;out of the box.&quot; I also was pleased to see that KDE displays fonts MUCH better than in previous releases.The only thing lacking in this version (personal version, but included in the Professional version) is Star Office or Open Office (which will allow you to read and write Word document files).Highly recommended."
57304,1,"Maptech's Terrain Navigator is great on your home computer, but Maptech also has a product called the Pocket Navigator that runs on Compaq Ipacs that you can take out in the field with you too!!! What will they think of next??? Now you can take their same USGS Topo Maps, download them onto your pocket pc, and as your hiking see exactly where you are!(sorry folks, doesn't work with the palm pilot)You can even hook it up to there new GPS unit the Navman!!!!They have great info about this product on their website (...) you should check it out! I did and I love it!"
60942,1,"Quick Sync 3.0 does just what it says: background backups of changed files in directories you specify. It has saved my data on several occasions. I have been very pleased with this product, and have used it over the last couple of years. It does not take the place of more extensive backups, but is just great for interval, completely timely backups of work."
40183,1,"This program is easy to use for anyone who has used at least one drawing program in the past. The manual gives you alot of great tips and explains ALL the features. You can export into all general formats which makes your art very portable. If they had included tutorials for each of the tools, I would have given it 5 stars."

I was pleased by the many video clips set to music with the likes of Pamela Anderson and especially Jenny McCarthy caught and kept my attention. I spent hours upon hours infront of my computer viewing each CD from start to finish much like I do with each monthly issue. I found every Playmate to be hotter and sexier than the next. I've noticed often when I'm alone I find myself infront of my computer with Playboy's Collection more often than flipping pages. ... Enjoy! I am...."
80907,0,"Basically let me list the problems.The anitspam and antispyware programs are weak and sometimes ineffective. Sometimes it actually increases the spam you get! Many times the antispyware does not completely remove all parts of the offending program your trying to get rid of!The Antivirus software is really strong but not as strong as Norton Antivirus 2005. It does use fewer system resources and scans much faster than Norton's though! I like PC-Cillin AV and for the most part it is almost equal to Norton AV 2005.The firewall is ok but the default settings leave it vulnerable and wide open! Be prepared to dig in to the guts and fix it yourself!In my opinion, you would be better off buying PC-Cillin Antivirus and using the free firewalls from Zonealarm or Sygate then adding a good antispam program and using many of the FREE antispyware programs readily available...like SPYBOT 1.3 !!!!I really like Trend Micro products but this one falls short."

65310,1,My son absolutely loves this product. He makes trading cards for his Hockey Team and has a blast doing so. It's very easy to use and the cards print out very nicely. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has kids in youth sports.
79192,1,"If you are looking for the highest quality clip art images in bitmat format you will not have to look any further. I have purchased the collection of 25,000 images several months ago and have found them invaluable. The ease of converting them to floating objects in Photoshop or Photo-Paint is as easy as loading the mask channel that is part of each file."
27693,1,"I was a Quicken user for 9 years and made the switch to Money 2000, then 2001. I recently downloaded Money 2002 Trial version and was very happy with it which lead to my purchase of Money 2002 Deluxe.Here's some baseline stats on my system:AMD Athlon 1G with 256 MB RAM. My money file is about 17MB large (containing all transactions since 1991).Things I really liked:- reports run much faster now. (in Money 2001, reports used to take 30-60 seconds; now they take less than 10 seconds; this is still much slower than Quicken's, but is improving).- &quot;Income vs. Spending Over time&quot; graph is now part of the report. This allows for graphing monthly income vs. expense side-by-side. This was alwasy available in Quicken, but not in Money till 2002.- Very clean and nice GUI- Customizable home page with Follow-up notes, Spending Progress, Flagged transactions.- Reconciliation with online bank or charge card downloads are much more intuitive and easy over 2001. [Make sure you turn off automatic Accept in Options].- transaction data entry, download reconciliation, and reports all have their performances improved much.- auto backup of the 17MB file is much quicker now than in 2001.Other reviewers have disliked some Money behaviors, but most of them can be changed via &quot;Options&quot;.- ads can be turned off- registration reminders can be turned off- MoneySide can be turned off- Auto Accepts during download can be turned offOverall, MS Money 2002 is much improved over 2001 in performance and features and GUI."
25829,1,"Maybe I got lucky, but I've installed NIS 2003 on three different computers (2 with 98SE and 1 with XP Home) and I have had no problems whatsoever. Installation was a breeze on all three. I have yet to look at the owners manual as the programs are very intuitive. Because I wanted to network all three computers together, getting a personal firewall was priority one.In short, I would recommend this program to anyone. Just be sure to remove any previous virus/firewall programs on your PC."
92793,2,"I thought this would have more potential based on what the back of the box said and how this program &quot;compared&quot; to the other similar programs! I was so frustrated and disgusted by the time I was done! Not everyone out there has a big, sprawling house... I have a simple cape that I want to do some remodeling on and this program basically ignores any thing of reasonable/modest size - so if you have a modest size house DON'T waste your time or money with this you're better off drawing it yourself with paper and pencil!!!!!If I could I would give it &quot;0&quot; stars."
85210,1,"I love petz.The first petz version i had was petz 4,crazy story how i was introduced. Someone gave me an old computer and we restarted it up it had a couple of icons one of them were petz 4 and i said what the heck is this so we reinstalled it. It was so cool becuz you could breed em, play with em ,and feed em. All had their own personalities like scared orange shorthairs,grumpy bulldogs, finicky persians. Sadly, my old computer that i used to play petz 4 on crashed . Few years later ,i thought about gettin it again instead petz 5. I'm gettin it in the mail in a week i'm so excited to do it all over again. Things that some reviews said was that you have to play games just to get bowls and toys sucks but what i hate is why couldnt they give basic things like 2 bowls and a toy to start you off pretty stupid dont isnt, but that's me.To sum it all up it's a really good game for cat and dog lover or just people who always wanted one like i was when was little, but now i a have a cute,funny,exuberent pittbull but any way that's what i think(read bottom)p.s you can also download other animals into your game like wolves,wild catz,reptilez,and birdz just google it"

89887,1,"My dad bought this for me and when I finally used it I was hooked. It reviewed like everything we'd been learning in my biology class which was great because I couldn't bring the textbook home and didn't like reading it anyway! This helps you make little flash cards and gives you little games to play and stuff. Since I like stuff being presented to me in this way it was love at first ""play"".I lost it a couple years ago and never found it again which has really peeved me because I've been eager to dive back in! I never used the Chemistry part but it pry rocked too.Is this the best program on this subject? No idea. But nonetheless I was happy."
71651,1,"NTI CD&DVD Maker 7 Platinum has been upgraded to Media Maker 8. I had no problems with Maker 7, and Maker 7 has been my main CD/DVD burning program. But Media Maker 8 appears to be incompatible with Microsoft's Media Center. Even when uninstalled it leaves some problems that can take considerable work to repair. Timely service was not available from NTI, and the company falsely claimed it was a problem specific to my computer, not one with their program. The company takes a ""10% transaction fee"" in any refund and if you pay for a CD copy rather than a download, you will lose shipping charges, too. So, I suggest that if you want to try Media Maker 8 (or Maker 8 Premium) do not pay in advance. Go to the NTI website itself and download a trial version first to verify that it will work in your computer before you actually buy it."
70439,1,Wahoo!! Couldn't wait to receive this product for my Mac Poerbook laptop to assist in my independent filmmaking. It is a little complex but fun and effective. Good product! Fast delivery! Excellence seller!!
92222,0,The overall quality is good but.- There are still many inaccuracies. MicroSoft doesn't really take suggestions very well.- The GPS interface is buggy to the point of utter worthlessness- The substitution of Slow/Ave/Fast for the speeds on various road types in lieu of the previous numerical inputs is a BIG step back as far as I am concerned.
67219,1,"All I have to say is WOW! Alphabet is children's software at its finest. This game not only introduces kids to the letters of the alphabet but also to the mouse and keyboard. I enjoyed playing with my daughter because the graphics are so rich and the music is fascinating. This game is really about art. Like a wonderful picture book, Alphabet has given our family hours of enjoyment."
20278,1,"I have been using Visual Age for Java for a while now (since version 1.0) and have found it to be evolving very well.It currently supports all the major Java standards from Enterprise java beans to Java Server pages and all this within the most consistent user interface I have seen in this sort of environments. It integrates very nicely with other IBM tools like Websphere studio, without locking you in.The projects, packages, classes and interfaces are stored in a virtual workspace. This resides in a special file, which is the only drawback to the product (you cannot access the files except from within VAJ unless you export them), but that's the price you pay for extensive search capabilities, versioning and integration.An excelent product overall."
60398,1,"This remarkable program astonishes people. It may be the finest software I have ever used--and I've used more than my share. OmniGraffle is designed to create visual representations of data, from time lines, to flow charts, to electronic diagrams, to office lay-outs, and much, much more. But this sterile list hardly does justice to the amazing flexibility and ease of use of this program. Everything from object fill, to line width, to line features, to labelling, to color, to fonts, to page lay-out are so feature rich, so user friendly as to put any competitors to rest. There certainly is nothing even close to this software in the Windows world. (If you are using something like Visio for these tasks, you are in the stone-age.) I wish I could include a sample document to illustrate what this program can do. But, since I can't, go to OmniGroup's web site (www.omnigroup.com) to check out their examples.I'd give this a 10 if I could."
1044,1,"I have been working with Microsoft Office since it was first released by Microsoft. But this is the best release so far. Once you get use to the new ribbon interface, the products flow so much better. The ribbon interface is the best upgrade to the Microsoft Office products. I use the interface in all of the products except of course in Publisher were the old interface is still in place. It is much easier working with the ribbon interface because all the tools that you need are right in front of you."
86422,1,"This is really nice intuitive software. It feels as though it was designed by photographers rather than computer programmers.If you've ever produced your own prints in a darkroom, this software does those sorts of photo improvements better than any other software out there. For instance you can lighten/darken areas so easily, you just click in the area you want to work on and the software works out what area you want to affect. So you don't need to do the laborious tracing you have to do in Photoshop. It's hard to believe but the software just gets it right and does what you want! This aspect is quite magical and revolutionizes photo processing. You'll get great results faster and easier. You can also do many other traditional photographic alterations really easily, such as make beautiful sepia prints, and make black and white prints with proper contrast and tone like traditional black and white film, something other photo software struggles to achieve.However, Nikon Capture NX lacks some of Photoshop Elements' features. For instance it has no instant spot removal tool. Capture NX is about making existing photos look great, not about changing them completely. So for instance in Photoshop I can move a person to a different place in the picture - I can 'fake' a picture. I can't in Capture NX. Capture NX is more about photography, less about gimmicks. 'Real' photographers - such as people who used to make their own prints from film in a darkroom - will love this software.I also have Photoshop Elements, and I've decided I'll need to keep using that occasionally as well - for spot removal, changing backgrounds and the more gimmicky photo manipulations. But for general photographic use I'll be using Capture NX 90% of the time. I don't have a Nikon camera, I have a Fuji, which shows how Capture NX is good for everyone, not just Nikon owners. By the way, it's worth buying the book about it, because it's so different from other photo software (but actually far easier) that you might not realize how to use it unless you read a book on it.Overall, Nikon Capture seems a little expensive - I reckon it should really cost no more than Photoshop Elements - but is is amazing: a new milestone in photo software."
64626,1,My 2 1/2 year old loves the game. He always want to play Dora even though I do have other games for him as well. He does need my help from time to time but mostly I can let him just go and play on his own with very little super vision. I did not like how easy it is for him to accidently click on higher levels and I would have to fix it and put it back down to level 1 again. Overall I really liked this game for my son.
28200,1,I love this game. My only suggestion is that the houses and hotels should look like houses and hotels instead just like the game board tokens. The properties run the spectrum from landfill to high end real estate so it'd be more fun to see a realistic building(s)that corresponds to the property. Even better would be several building styles from which to choose.
13010,2,"As a 7+ year TT user, I've got to say that 2004 will be my last year. After collecting $40 for Deluxe, they fleeced me for $30 more so that I could complete the ESPP section of my taxes. This was previously included in Deluxe, but no warning was given that they made this change (fewer features for the same price). Plus I'm tired of the terrible support and the annual rebate game they force me to play to get my $10 or $30 back. Will check out TaxAct and TaxCut next year."
26113,0,"Right out of the box I had to download the lattest version before I could backup an entire dvd. It took a couple days to get through to a server. E-mailed tech support and got an answer the next day that their server was having trouble. When backing up an entire dvd you will notice some quality loss. You can't make a backup from the backup, I also had some backups that would play sometimes and not the next. I stopped using X copy express and now use DVD Shrink. It's not point and click, but it is free."
9908,1,"The movie that started a martial arts craze across America with a very good video game as well. Although obviously a remake of Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee, Mortal Kombat is more about pleasing teens than adults. Magic duels, psychic fights, and superhuman Karate are what Mortal Kombat is about. If you like this, try Invincible starring Billy Zane which can be found here at Amazon.com(I bought both here). Invincible is like this but more aimed at an older audience. If it gets you pumped(the opening theme song does!) and/or you simply like Karate movies, this is not the best but is far,far,far from the worst. Buy it if it is cheap but not if it costs over $10. Invincible? Now THAT is worth $10!"
34032,1,"Owning nearly every game in the Nancy Drew PC series, I'd have to say that one of the many things that HERInteractive excels at is the absence of repetition; Each and every one of their games feels unique and is lots of fun, although some may be more enjoyable than other ones. This one also has a unique location, a ranch in the Arizona desert. While sleuthing and the wild west don't seem like a match in your mind, this game is definitely an amazing edition to the series, and deserves a spot on any detective's game shelf.Story: 9/10. This game pretty much has two stories. There's the fact that a glowing white horse gallops past the ranch occasionally at night, and when it does, bad things start to happen. There's also the story that an outlaw named Dirk Valentine left treasure somewhere at or near the ranch. As the game went on, the two stories somewhat started to meld together, and it was super exciting seeing Dirk Valentine's treasure hunt progress.Graphics/Setting: 9/10. For a game that's seven years old, the graphics are still pretty decent even by HERInteractive standards today. Sure, the characters movements are still robotic in this one, but the scenery makes up for it; Which brings me to one of the big highlights of this game, the setting. It was such an incredible idea to put Nancy Drew in the wild west and shortly live the life of a cow girl. The music was absolutely perfect for the setting, and it was a very realistic experience for a pc game.Atmosphere: 9.5/10. Definitely the best atmosphere of any game up to this point, and possibly of the whole series. The AMAZING music fit the game perfectly, and the backgrounds (not the real pictures), were very realistic, and although I played this game on a computer like all other games in this series, I felt somewhat attached to the game's atmosphereCharacters: 8.5/10. The characters were decent this time around. You have three very different cowboys, and Mary Yazzie, a store owner a couple of miles away from the ranch. They each had their own distinct personalities, I just wish they'd shined through more often.Puzzles: 8/10. Not way too many puzzles this time around, which for me was definitely a positive. Most of them fit the game, and were a good balance in terms of difficulty.Ending: 9/10. A somewhat surprising and creepy ending. It's pretty simple, but still took me a few second chances to end the game.Total (averaged): 8.83 out of 10, rounded to....9/10.A truly unique and enjoyable Nancy Drew game, the atmosphere and story is top notch, and this game deserves a spot on any Nancy Drew fan's shelf."
72060,1,"Ventura has always offered more features per dollar than its rival desktop publishing programs (some experts who use them all estimate it would cost $10,000 in add-ins for Quark Express to have all the features included with Ventura). I've tried some of the others, but none really can match the ease of use and power of Ventura 8, and now Ventura 10. Ventura is simply the best for publishing books, newsletters, magazines, brochures, flyers, and catalogs.New to Version 10 is a great ""Publish to PDF"" feature that turns your Ventura documents into letter perfect PDF files with a few clicks of the mouse. Ventura's modeless cursor really speeds up production as does its built-in Database Publisher which enabled us to produce over 300 fully formated pages of our book ""International Job Finder"" in an afternoon -- including two extensive indexes! The Navigator makes it easy to change the order of chapters in a document and easily track down index entries, markers, and cross references.I won't pretend Ventura 10 is perfect -- it was designed to run only in Windows XP and 2000. But it is very stable; bugs are no worse than what its competition offer. Since I started using version 8 several years ago, I have not had to call Tech Support even once. There's an incredible newgroup of Ventura users (at cnews.corel.ca, under corel.graphic_apps) around the world who can quickly -- and accurately -- answer any question you proffer."
67549,1,"I had some difficulty getting this game to work, though I don't think it the fault of the game--it is an older version and we knew that when I ordered it. I finally went to the website the game is supported on and the website for the computer/s we wanted to load this on; amazingly I finally was able to get the game to work ok on Windows XP by using the compatibilty ability of XP, asking for compatibility with Windows 95 and changing the resolution and bit settings. Otherwise we were having trouble with immediate black screen, and freezing up at the first river crossing (both of these problems are mentioned on the website; I haven't been able to load it onto my nephew's computer sucessfully; he uses Windows 98, which should work ok, but even though he has the RAM the game requires, it appears not to when we try. I purchased this for him for a thank you for help he gave me this summer; I guess he will have to use it on his parents computer for now. He had remembered it from using it some while back and is enjoying it again. The game works really well once the difficulties are overcome; the seller did great in prompt delivery and the game was exactly as described. I am rating 4 stars only because of our difficulties getting it to work.....Otherwise, thanks for a great job & the game is great!"
88644,1,"My daughter loves this game. From the ages of 4 to 7 she has enjoyed the building and fixing projects, finishing them with different color options. It helps in learning to following directions and think logically. She really felt like she was using real tools to make the projects. She's not ready to get rid of it yet !"
32867,1,"Like PhotoShop, Porfolio is rich and deep. It rewards patient, attentive souls who study and learn. Portfolio 4 was a Godsend for me eight years ago. With it, I was able to efficiently organize thousands of images and produce a complex CD-ROM project. Since then I have used versions 5, 6, and now 7. All have been very useful.Catalogs are a great feature of Portfolio. You can create multiple catalogs from the same database: one for this book, one for that report, one for this chapter, and another for that chapter. A single image can appear in one catalog or in many catalogs. You can drag an image out of a catalog and drop it in a report. All the while you have just one picture stored in one database. Not that long ago, for Windows users, there was nothing like Portfolio. Now Windows Explorer displays thumbnails, filmstrips, and EXIF data. Programs bundled with digital cameras, like Canon's Zoombrowser, are very easy to use, not to mention Google's Picassa. If one those is working for you, stay with it. However, if you have multiple publishing projects that require searching or scanning thousands of images, and if you use programs like Adobe InDesign to publish them, then you may find Porfolio indispensible."

58253,0,"Well, this game was great at first. I found the clues on the bulletin boards and talked to the suspects. But there were many places that were just too hard. I still haven't reached the end of the mystery. I couldn't figure out how to get into the pharmacy. It took me weeks to figure out how to get into the teachers lounge. I think Hal Tanaka did it, but it's hard to be sure. She accused him, and he denied it. No one else will let me talk to them anymore and I have the tape from Jake's locker, but I'm stuck. So, this may be for kids, but it was a little too hard for someone my age, and even for my dad. I'm not saying that you should make it so easy that it's unbearable, but just try to make it less stressful. Hey, it's a great game! I loved the mystery of everything--great music too! I just think it's too hard to get to the bottom of the mystery."
4556,1,"I bought this language course 2 weeks ago (actually from Transparent's website because they gave a big discount).When I first looked at the course I was a little disappointed. It only has 4 texts. However after working with it I realized that the texts are really long and it will take quite a while to go through them all. What I really love about this product are the activities. They're so much fun. Crosswords, finding missing words in a sentence, unscrambling sentences, and lots more. I enjoy it a lot and noticed that I've learned quite a bit of Swedish already, just by playing these activities.I guess you have to get used to the kind of learning approach this software offers. They don't take you by the hand and lead you on a given path, you have to motivate yourself and find your way around.9/13/2007: I just want to add that this software comes with the flash card software Before You Know It Lite. It's an awesome vocabulary learning software. I actually upgraded to the Deluxe version yesterday. Learning with this software is so much fun I enjoy it every night. (I must be a nerd. :-))"

47833,2,"I would love to give this product a positive review. However, I have not been able to use it. After calling tech support, it seems that Windows 98 2nd edition causes some type of conflict, and although you'll be able to install the program, you will not be able to use the software. Broderbund says that you can return the software to them under their exchange policy, as there is currently no fix for the problem. But...what a pain. If there had just been a note on the package, I never would have bought it until I knew it was compatible with my Operating System."

67782,1,"First, let me start off by noting that almost all of the reviewers that gave Red Hat Linux 9 very low marks had mostly hardware incompatibility issues. They bought Red Hat, threw the CD in the CD drive, and hoped for the best, expecting it to be able to successfully detect and configure all of their particular hardware.While Linux has made tremendous strides in hardware compatibility and usually can work with most hardware right out of the box, it does not have the advantage of market critical mass and monopolistic power that Microsoft has. Thus, all vendors that sell hardware for the home PC provide drivers for Windows, being that Windows has about 95% of that market. That being said, Linux now has made tremdous stides in hardware support. It supports most major hardware products, but lacks in the area of some of the more exotic or bleeding edge graphics cards, sound cards, network cards, and most winmodems. It's getting better all the time (due to open source developers reverse engineering, and many vendors providing drivers), but Linux can't boast the level of hardware support that Windows can, due to market realities.The people who gave bad reviews attempted to blindly install Red Hat Linux on their machines, without checking for hardware support ahead of time. Thus, due to hardware incompatibility or configuration, they had headaches and wrongly blamed Linux.My personal experience with Linux in general and Red Hat 9 in particular has been wonderful. I've installed it on an IBM Thinkpad 600E. The installation went smoothly and I only had to manualy choose the correct video driver. It did not detect the Mwave internal winmodem (I expected this) and did not detect the sound card, but I do not need sound on my notebook. Apparently it is possible to configure so that Red Hat can use the sound card, but I don't need it. But Red Hat did seamlessly detect everything else and it all worked beautifully.I've had a lot of fun with Linux. I'm a programmer and it is chaulk full of development tools (without having to pay mega $ for MS Visual Studio). Linux is a programmers paradise. It also has everything MS Office has (with Open Office and KOffice). It can manipulate graphics with the GIMP, it has tons of games, and endless configuration possibilties. RH Linux loads both the Gnome and KDE desktop environments, and it's fun to play with both, being that they are not exactly alike, and both have different strengths and weeknesses. And both, quite frankly, are much more attractive and fun to use than the Fisher Price interface of Windows XP. They are also far more configurable, with much more eye candy than XP. I've also been able to successfully download and install and use huge software titles like JBuilder 5 and Eclipse (Java Integrated Development Environments).I've also been completely impressed with the amazing stability and efficiency of Linux. I can crash an application, but it never affects the OS. I just have to kill the app, and everything else goes about it's merry way without a hitch. Contrast that with Windows XP, and all of it's bugs and the slightest application problem can bring it to it's knees (prompting you to send a bug report to MS). Or, of course, the infamous Blue Screen of Death. No BSOD in Linux at all. And finally, there are far fewer virus worries with Linux.In short, Linux is great. It might be a bit rough around the edges for some newbie/non technical users, but it is very easy to use (just requires a small learning curve, just like anything else new) and can do so many great things, at a small fraction of the cost of MS alternatives.Those new to Linux should probablly start off with a distribution that runs from a CD, like Knoppix. Knoppix automatically detects and configures your hardware. All you have to do is pop the CD in and reboot. And it is completely risk free because it does not touch your hard drive. Knoppix can give you a taste of how great Linux can be. And if you like what you see, you should first check hardware compatibility at the distros web site, thanprobably re-partition your hard drive with Partition magic. And of the distro set up routines will detect the partitions and allow you easily set up a dual boot PC. Alternatively, buy a whole new PC with Linux pre-loaded (ensuring hardware compatibility). You can do that here at Amazon, or Walmart or Lindows.com, or many others. You can get a new PC for as little as $200 (the cost of WinXP by itself).But do give it a try and be prepared for hardware compatibility and that it is a different OS, so there will be a small learning curve. It's very well worth the effort.The only reasons I did not give Red Hat Linux 9 the full 5 stars is because Red Hat has ended their retail product, concentrating on the enterprise. Also, Red Hat Linux does not include a disc partitioning tool like Mandrake and SuSE do. But I've loved it. I'm now looking forward to partitioning my eMachines PC with WinXP, and loading a dual boot Linux installation. I just have not decided which distribution it's going to be."
68779,1,I purchased the version with the GPS and am very happy with the product. There doesn't seem to be very many changes from the prior years version of this product but I was pleased with that program also. The GPS unit is second to none. It is very accurate and the sensitivity is quite good. It picks up signals quickly even while under cover. The driving guidance works well and gives just the right amount of time when giving verbal directions. Overall this is a good package.
71755,1,I just got this game at Bookmans last night. I have played it and the gameplay is pretty hard. The plot is also weird. Data wants you to incapacitate the Romulan with a Neural Disruptor instead of using a phaser. What is up with that? I am just rating this game 5 stars because I have not played it that much and that I have hopes that the game will be better
74028,0,"After I bought Studio 10 I spent the next 5 weeks tring to get it to work. Pinnacle was not willing to refund, so I settled in to the support forums and eventually it produced a final product. 5 stars for easy and fun to use. 1 star for the hassle and unpreparedness of the software at release. If you are computer savvy and have a lot of patience, go ahead. It will definately challenge you. Or, wait until mid 1st quarter 2006. Rumor has it they should have a patch to fix it, making it a great product."

91316,0,"I've been using Contribute 3 Win/Mac for four months now to update my website.I have three complaints:1. Updating with Contribute 3 is very slow because of waiting while going back and forth between the 'Edit' and 'Publish' modes - even though I have hi-speed cable and a 1GHz G4 Mac.2. Line spacing in Edit mode does not agree with spacing when I go to Publish mode. So has to be done over by trial and error, usually several times as it's erratic and hard to outguess. And all this is dragged out by item 1 above.3. Contribute does not allow viewing and editing Source Code. Hard to understand why they left this out as it's an integral part of web editing."
2455,1,"I enjoyed watching Kasparov discuss the Queen's Gambit with such brilliance, and I agree with other reviewers who say that he comes across as down-to-earh. There is no question about his passion for the game, and any chess player will enjoy the commentary of this legendary grandmaster. I give it four stars because a better production was actually possible. In fact, with a bit of focus and organization, this DVD could have been a valuable instructional tool. The problem is that Kasparov goes on many tangents, and while this is occasionally unavoidable when discussing variations, it can become tedious. It's not a matter of his English, either--he expresses himself well. Overall, I couldn't help but get the impression that this was filmed haphazardly--that is, he probably just sat down and began discussing the opening any which way. What was needed was the careful selection of themes within the framework of the lecture; the DVD could have been divided into crucial minilessons that retained focus instead of random observations with loose-fitting titles. If the aim was to teach, then the approach needs modification. I'm a decent player with club and some tournament experience. I followed him as best as I could, but I can see a beginner being easily overwhelmed and quickly losing interest. As a fan, it's a pleasure to watch him discuss the game; as a life-long student of chess, I expect more."
75017,1,The Rosetta Stone Immersion program is great! I haven't finished with the whole program yet but so far I've reinforced the basic Spanish that I knew and am learning so much more. I am happy that I bought the package with all three levels. It's a big savings compared to buying the levels individually. I highly recommend it!
92361,1,This was a truely good enjoyable film. Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez held their own with a lukewarm script. The groom seemed more like a prop than a character and the women's antics did get a little outrageous...but it was all in good fun. I agree with other reviewers: Wanda Sykes had the best lines and managed to steal a few scenes from the great Ms. Fonda. All in all a good rental.
10612,1,"I've heard mixed reviews on Office for Mac. As a new iMac owner, I am happy to have a familiar Microsoft product to ease the transition. I haven't had any issues yet. Performance seems just as fast as on my PC at work. It's taking awhile to get used to the formatting palettes, particularly on Powerpoint, but that's not a big issue."
81808,1,Audio Studio works fine to transfer LPs to CD. It is easy to reduce pops and clicks. It does not take all of them out automatically but if you spend enough time you can take out the ones it misses. It has a lot of other features that I don't use.
91357,1,"My husband is our household's primary computer user. He's always controlled computer time in our home the way most men control the remote. But now he has a fight on his hands.He bought me Scrapbook Factory Deluxe on Amazon.com a few weeks ago. Big mistake for him because I can't put it down. I'm finally doing something with the gobs of pictures we have of the kids - both old pictures and new digital pictures - and I'm producing really terrific albums and scrapbooks.The software has pretty much everything needed to make scrapbooks every bit as nice as the handmade kind I've made in the past, and there are tons of templates for everything from vacations to weddings to christenings to camping trips. It's really very well done.I highly recommend Scrapbook Factory if you want to do more with your pictures than just keep them in boxes in the basement or on your hard disk. It's definitely a good investment."
91949,1,"As with all the Nancy Drew Games, I really liked this game, but I thought it was not as interesting and original as some of the other ND games. For example, a few times throughout Danger by Design, I thought it was similiar to ""Danger on Deception Island"". Maybe it was the water, maybe it was the ""secret passages"", but Danger By Design really reminded me of previous games. (By the way, I LOVED how references were made to ""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"". I think it's really funny!) Another disappointment was the fashion. Yes, you get to ""put together"" one outfit, but that's pretty much all the interaction with fashion that you get!(I loved the outfits though. They were SO funny!) As an in tern to a famous fashion designer, you think you would get to do more things to do with fashion! The cover of the CD case says ""Go undercover in Paris and unravel a case in style!"" This makes it seem like you should actually have something to do with style. Also, the ending was TOTALLY unrelated to anything, but it was actually very funny, so that's OK.Now onto the good stuff! Contrary to what many people seem to think, I LOVED the ending with the culprit! It is VERY original, and different, and I think that while it seems a little unrealistic, it's fun, so who cares? Also, the reason Minnette wore a mask is funny, and personally I'm glad it wasn't for a gross reason! I was a LITTLE sad by why Minnette was acting so strangely (not because it was a ""bad"" reason, actually I liked the reason) but because... well... I like her! If I say anything else I'll give the ending away, so that's it! Also, I liked all the characters, and the animation was really good! I wish you could interact a little more with the characters, but there's plenty to do! I like how you bake cookies and make tea, and, as always, Bess and George are very funny. On the bad side, this game is relatively short, but it's not tedious, which is what makes some of the games (like ""The Curse of Blackmoor Manor"") long. You can tell that the game is about to end soon, it's very obvious, I don't know if that's bad or good, you decide. I also liked how you have money, and a chance to earn money, and how you can buy stuff!!! You can also go swimming, but make sure you come up for air! :) There is a ""history mystery"" as well, which is actually more of what you try to solve, but it is interesting, so even if you don't like history (I don't especially), you won't be bored. Oh, and if you don't like fashion, don't worry, there's not much in this game! (As I said, I was a little disappointed by this.) One of the other things I liked about this game is that in the beginning, you see Nancy's bedroom (and her teddy bear!) and the game doesn't begin or end with a letter, but the end is kind of like a letter to yourself. I like the letters, but I also like this original way of introducing and ending the game.Overall, I'd say that this game is pretty easy, but not TOO easy. This game is good for beginners, but no matter what level you are you will probably enjoy ""Danger by Design"". On a scale of 1-10, I'd say the difficulty level is 4-6, depending on how good you are at Nancy Drew.One final thing. While this game is not Her Interactive's best, it's still a fun, fast(ish) moving game and worth your money!"
30344,1,"I bought this game for our 4 year old after he tried it out at the Apple Store. It was his first computer game and he gets to use it on Dad's computer. He is having a great time with it and loves the challenges of matching, finding treasure, etc.Because he just turned 4, he has not mastered all of the skills required, but he loves the challenge. This game is educational, helps to improve his computer skills, fun and makes him feel like a winner.I highly recommend this game. Kids may need to get used to using the mouse and I would not buy this for any child under the age of 4."

45696,1,"IMHO, this is a very good Linux distribution among those I have ever used.The system I used to install SuSE Linux 9 Pro is a two-year old IBM ThinkPad T23 (P-III 1.0 GHz, HD 30 GB, Mem 512 MB, MS Windows 2000 Pro preinstalled ...). I have to admit that I did not succeed in the first attempt, either the mouse (ext. USB MS Intelli/Optical Wheel mouse) or the keyboard did not work correctly. In my second attempt, everything went smoothly, and I could work under both SuSE Linux and Win2000 with the GRUB boot manager. All within an hour in the configuration and installation processes. I did not read the manuals at all, the GUI installation interface is very intuitive. Good work by SuSE!!!In the past I have used, from the first day installing Linux on an Intel x486 box, Slackware Linux, Caldera OpenLinux (now SCO!?), TurboLinux, RedHat Linux (6.x - 9), Mandrake Linux, and SuSE Linux. Caldera's OpenLinux 2.4 (eDesktop) was once my favarite. RedHat is OK, but it abandoned further release after RedHat Linux 9; you have to find ""Fedora"" for help.Currently and in the near future, I will rely on SuSE and Slackware for Open Source Linux applications development and Desktop/Laptop uses. If you like more user-friendly installation, configuration and future support , choose SuSE; for a clean and fast Linux, choose Slackware (now in v9.1).Enjoy!!!"
30006,1,"I have installed NISS07 in both a Laptop and a Desktop unit and have found no problems so far. I've had it installed for over a month and updates are working, scans have produced spyware and killed it. I have not noticed either system slowing down or taking a very long time to boot like with NAV06 and NPF06. The Laptop has a 1.3 gig processor with 512mb ram and the desktop has a 2.08 gig AMD processor with 1gb ram. I'm not giving it 5 stars because nobody's perfect!

63439,1,"Pinnacle Studio has features and ease of use over other brands. Most packages will enable edits and music, otherwise they are not marketable. Pinnacle has the whole package in that it is feature rich, but also enables you to make DVD quality (mpeg2+) disks. Many other packages only output to VCD. One competitor Adobe Premier Elements is more complicatd to use and does nothing better. For example, Pinnacle's storybook allows assembling your clips and pictures, then use the timeline for music and fine tuning. Adobe is mostly timeline with hard-to-use music overlays. For those buying consumer/prosumer software Pinnacle is clearly the best."

61537,1,"Works great. I have it on two Windows XP Pro boxes and one Windows Vista Ultimate.I turned off the backup since I have a server that all of my machines backup to using the built in (more flexible) Windows backup/Scheduler. I also unchecked the notification that pops up letting me know it""allowed this or that"".Personally I think Anti-Virus is 90% hype...and 10% reality and that 98% of malware can be avoided by safe computing and automatic updates. Add in a home router (Linksys, Neartgear etc) and you add another layer of protection. I have been using PC's since DOS 3.3 and have never gotten a virus....but have always paid money for AV software.....almost like car insurance.Specials are run on this software all the time...its not uncommon to find it for $19.99.For people having problems. I have seen problems especially if another AV program was un-installed first and a new one was installed. Norton/Symantec is horrible about not fully un-installing.Also new computers these days from the likes of Dell, HP, Toshiba and Acer come polluted with trail-ware to include AV software...some of which are complete security suits. I blow away any new PC and re-install the OS when I get them today, it's the only way to clean out the junk for sure. This of course is not for everyone.Anyhow great product, cheap and very good for the average user that was does not want to tweak their PC......but actually use it."

16693,0,"McAfee's Personal Firewall Plus version 5.0 was almost unilaterally panned by everyone who reviewed it. The same can pretty much be said for McAfee's VirusScan 8.0. I'm not sure the latest versions of these programs are going to do much to quiet the negative reviews.As I stated in my title, VirusScan 9.0 and Firewall Plus 6.0 are not much different from their predecessors. The only real change is the engines underneath the programs. Only time will tell whether or not the improvements in this area are enough to satisfy the critics.Before I get into anything else McAfee related, let me review the actual programs themselves.VirusScan 9.0:Considering all of the time I spend on my computer, whether it be writing a paper, surfing the World Wide Web, chatting with friends on IRC or through instant messaging, it's amazing that I only encounter a few contaminated files and programs a year (I'm not complaining, mind you). Thankfully, I have had a McAfee virus scanner on my computer since day one. And to this day, I have never had a virus or trojan horse successfully infect my computer.Installation is relatively easy (WARNING: Uninstall all McAfee programs AND follow the pre-installation instructions BEFORE attempting to install Virus Scan), taking less than 10 minutes to install, update, and adjust the settings. I have never had an installation or uninstallation issue with VirusScan, and McAfee has consolidated the number of settings (as well as how many levels you have to click through to get to them all) during the last couple of versions.Personal Firewall Plus 6.0:In May 2004, I finally moved out of the dark ages and moved from a dial-up connection to DSL. On the advice of a friend, I purchased a firewall program for the first time ever. Because I already used McAfee VirusScan (yes, I'm a glutton for punishment), I chose to buy Personal Firewall Plus version 5.0.Unlike many of the reviews I read, I did not have any system problems as a result of installing or uninstalling version 5.0. So far, version 6.0 has not given me any problems either. The interface is very easy for me to use, the settings give me just enough adjustibility to do what I need to do, and I have never had a problem with the program starting itself when I boot-up my computer.For someone like me, who is completely port illiterate, McAfee Personal Firewall Plus has done exactly what it is suppose to do: block the bad stuff from reaching my computer.If I was rating the virus scanner and firewall only, I would give them a 5-star rating since I have never had a problem with the programs themselves.Ah, but this is McAfee we are talking about. And when you buy a McAfee product, you also end up buying the stupidity of McAfee. There are three reasons why this McAfee VirusScan/Firewall bundle only gets a 3-star rating from me:REASON 1: McAfee has a habit of messing up their programs through the update features, especially the Security Center pop-up advertisement, uh.... I mean feature, that automatically comes with all McAfee products. So far, none of their update bugs have affected me where Firewall Plus is concerned, but the same cannot be said about VirusScan.REASON 2: As reported by many a reviewer, McAfee's customer service department is a joke. Their live instant messaging service has yet to ever resolve a customer's problem (an overstatement, I'm sure...... but not by much). And their paid service isn't much better. I know many people who refuse to purchase anything McAfee because of past experiences with their customer service department. Can't say I really blame them.REASON 3: I cannot stand the blatant McAfee advertisement that is known as Security Center. The splash screen that appears everytime you start your computer (and for which McAfee refuses to allow us to turn off) is nothing more than a pop-up advertisement that you pay to have installed on your computer. This splash screen is oh-so-nice in telling you what McAfee products you have yet to install on your computer. It doesn't matter if you are using a competitor's product. Security Center doesn't bother to check to see. It just forever tells you that you don't have McAfee this or McAfee that.Bottom line: If you are having problems with the previous versions, go ahead and buy these new versions. But I don't think the internal engine changes McAfee has made are worth the price (even a rebated price) to mess with upgrading now. Wait for the new versions to come out towards the end of 2005."

16923,1,"I had an under $99 program from another company that was popular, hard to use, buggy, and poorly supported. After reading reviews, and visiting their support site (a good idea for any software!), I chose HD Pro. I needed the pro version because the house I'm drawing has a cathedral ceiling with the roof slope different from the ceiling slope.Out of the box, installation and basic functions were easy. Less obvious things were easy to find in the help, after a few hours I felt proficient (it includes tutorials that looked good, but I didn't use them). For example, pony walls (bottom half is differrent construction from top half) are very easy. Simple roofs are easy, compex roofs are more challenging, but I suspect that they would be so in any program. The only thing so far that has been difficult (and poorly explained) is doing the entry on a raised ranch (it's between two floors, and has it's own levels for floor, ceiling and roof).Overall, I'm happy with this, you get what you pay for."

92376,1,This is a very unfunny movie about a woman named Charlie played by Jennifer Lopez who is engaged to Kevin. Kevin's mother Viola played by Jane Fonda does not approve of the union and sets about trying to destroy their relationship. At one point Charlie asks Viola if Liposuction hurts? If I ever met Jane Fonda I would most probably ask her the same question. One gets the impression that Viola could seriously benefit from some continued mandatory Anger Management Classes.I give this turkey of a movie 5 stars because the Professional Hair and Make Up guys have performed wonders on Ms. Fonda after an hour in the makeup trailer on the movie set.
72757,0,"Pretty good product. Still trying to learn my way around it. Definitely NOT as intuitive as Microsoft Money. Example: Reconciling an account in Money was pretty straight forward. You click transactions listed on your statement and when done, Money dings, you click confirmation and voila! iBank has you enter your statement and then you drag transactions onto the statement, you only know you are done when the transaction amount = 0. However, it is very easy to get confused and have debits as credits and vice versa. Basically, not nearly as easy to do as in Money. The nice thing is that it does keep a running list of statements you have entered, so theoretically no more digging through the filing cabinet to find that old statement.I don't download statements (I'm old school) and can't comment on that.iBank does what I need, it just makes me work a bit more than Money did. So, pretty good product, but definitely not great."
30373,0,"My 5 year old son was more excited about the game rather than the actual movie, however once we got it home and loaded I was greatly dissappointed. We were able to conquer the first adventure and then were not able to find any others. We searched and searched and even restarted the game many times. Finally, after an hour of trying to figure out what was wrong, I went to the website to find, to our dissappointmen, that it is only a cheap little demo. It seems like it would be a great game but Disney definitely should have stated that it is only a DEMO."
4782,1,"I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98. Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected. Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine. This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?"
12382,1,"I think XP is really great! To the people who have incompatibility issues, they are NOT irreconciable in most cases. You ALWAYS have to get the drivers for your older hard and software when you upgrade your operating systems. Many times, these are totally free and downloadable online. Check it out. This happened to us when we went from Windows 95 to 98, it's pretty standard. Such is the &quot;progress&quot; of computers!"
80019,1,"Let's start with a few disclaimers. If you don't have at least 2 Gigabytes of RAM on your computer, 50+ gigabytes of memory and a processor running at 1.5 gHZ or faster, there's a chance that this program will give you some issues. Additionally, as I've just learned from the earlier reviews, this program has the tendency to ""bug up"" from time to time. I've never had such a problem, but I'm certainly not the only in-design user out there.Everyone has that set of programs on their computer that they go back to, time after time, either out of necessity or out of love. For me, those programs would be Mozilla Firefox, Google Earth, Microsoft Word and--surprise, surprise--Adobe In-Design 3. Certainly, the last enjoys far less attention than the first three, but that's why I'm writing this review. If I can get the everyday consumer to stop, pause and examine this gem of a program a bit more closely, I'll be doing my job.Adobe In-Design is, among other things, a layout program. ""I already have one of those,"" you think to yourself, and point to your Frontpage, Pagemaker or Microsoft Word CD. That's what I thought for the better part of my life. I was satisfied with the design capabilities of Word; sure, they weren't what the Post or the Times would use, but I got by. That's when a high school journalism class introduced me to In-Design. The software, complex and intimidating at first, soon became second nature as I mastered all the little quirks of the program.Let's get one thing straight before we move on: this is not the type of software you want (or need) for Julie's fifth birthday invitation or the bakery's ""Help Wanted"" ad. In-Design is an expensive program. It also gives you a 747's worth of knobs, switches and settings to play around with. After 3 or 4 years of In-Design experience, I can safely say that I've only mastered 20% of the program. If you're looking for a simple, quick and cheap software, exit out of this page and do not return.If you're still reading, that means you want to bring your design enterprise to the next level. This is where I explain why I gave this little box five stars. In-Design gives you more control than you can ever imagine. It's tailored to the professional; though I can't bring up any links, I'm pretty sure that some of the world's largest newsletters, newspapers and magazines run on it or a like program. Adobe In-Design doesn't just replace the cursor with a box-and-grid format; it lets you fine-tune your boxes, grids, text boxes, pictures and graphics to an unrivaled extent. ID lets you manage strokes (borders), swatches (color palettes), individual hue options, multiple pages and a plethora of text effects. One of its best features is ""Object Styles,"" which allows you to set up a predetermined design for a box or graphic and replicate it across multiple versions of that box/graphic.In-Design lets you adjust the font, leading, tracking, kerning, horizontal and vertical scaling, baseline shift and skew FOR A SINGLE LETTER. It goes to the thousandth of a pica in box measurements. (That's a thousandth of a 72nd of an inch.) There's also the good old pen tool, armed with a dizzying array of line and curve options. Forgive me if it sounds like I'm listing features; when it comes to a program like CS3, you tend to lapse into that sort of tone.Admittedly, I'm not a professional designer. My pitch is better than that, though. In-Design MADE me want to become a professional designer, even if I'd had almost no layout experience beforehand. If you want to see how far Adobe's unmatched design program can take you, I would highly suggest adding this program to the toolbox. Expensive it might be, but InDesign is worth every cent."
9785,0,"The first time I seen this movie I thought it was great especially since I compared it to other video-game to movie translations which were horrible and disappointing, but for some reason, it got boring real fast after I watched it for the third time. When I saw it for the first time, I thought I would have to watch it at least 20 times before it even started to get boring because martial arts mixed with science-fiction is my absolute favorite kind of movie. The acting can get a little annoying but it's good enough as far as I'm concerned. The fight scenes was full of action and well choreographed, however the problem I have with the fight cheoreagraphy is that the kombatants didn't seem to show much style. Look at the last and AWSOME fight scene on the movie, &quot;Drive&quot; starring Mark Dacascos and you might understand what I mean if you don't by reading this review. (&quot;Drive&quot; was originally shown on H.B.O.) The biggest problem with &quot;MK:The Movie&quot; is that it, like the video-game, lacks originality. I mean for one thing, the story is a lot like the one from Bruce Lee's &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;. Think about it: The bad guy is responsible for the death of the main character's sibling. Later, the main character and a couple of friends go to an island, owned by the bad guy, to fight in a tournement and so on. The worst character in &quot;MK:The Movie&quot; seemed to be Sonya. Sure, she does look like her video-game counterpart, but the one fight scene with her, where she fights Kano, is LAME. In conclusion, this is good enough to rent a couple of times, but you might not want to buy it unless you are obssessed with MK. My copy of it is literally collecting dust. (WARNING: DONT EVEN WATCH THE SEQUAL!)"
64921,1,"Just returned from a workshop at the Santa Fe Photo Workshop. Was amazed to learn how much more I can do with Elements 3.0 compared to 2.0. There was no difference in the class between the capabilities of my Elements 3.0 and the folks who were using Photoshop CS2; however, there were lots of things I would not have been able to do in 2.0. I am sure that for professional photographers, CS2 offers many advantages - but, as a ""serious amateur"", I am glad I didn't spring for the additional cost. I love the way you can move back and forth between the quick fix function and standard editing with just a click on buttons at the top of the screen. Having the adjustment sliders down the right side of the screen is very convenient - although that makes the photo workspace smaller. For the price, Elements 3.0 is top notch in my opinion."

84323,1,"As an early adapter of new technology, and someone that had been beta testing the program for over a year before released to the general public, know that there is much more to the new Vista OS than just the pretty interface.A couple of things to keep in mind, especially if you don't want to be overly frustrated during the installation process. 1) make sure you run the compatibility application that is available for down load from Microsoft. This will do a scan of your system and give you a heads up as for what applications on your current system, will work and which ones wont (assume that if it gets mentioned in the scan report, it wont work). Personally I tend to do a wide variety of graphic work beyond just the pre-installed software that comes with Microsoft. I will say that the new movie maker, photo gallery, photo editing, are all decent programs for the beginner, not for the professional. 2) be prepared for printer issues. For some reason, even though this OS was years in the works, manufacturers have not pro actively made many printer drivers available. MAKE SURE YOUR PRINTER WILL WORK WITH VISTA. 3) be prepared to confirm every action you do. Vista uses a new security control process called ""USER ACCOUNT CONTROL,"" and let me tell you, you will be beating you mouse in no time with the frequency of the pop up for this control. Delete a folder, you get a warning, change a file name, you get a warning, move a file from a back up drive to a new location, you get a warning. If you have seen the Apple commercial talking about the new security feature, there is a great amount of truth in what is being presented. Then again, you can just turn it off, but you will have a little red shield with an ""X"" warning you of potential danger in your system tray (the bunch of icons in the lower right corner of your screen, by the clock).So is the upgrade worth it, perhaps, but you will get it anyway if you purchase a new system. It may be worth just waiting. On the other hand, I will say the new Office, I think is fantastic, if you get a chance, definitely check it out.Good luckBy no means am I saying this is a bad program, actually to the contrary, I have been very pleased with Vista, just be aware of what you are getting yourself into."

The most common complaint when my students go to the required Quark courses: ""It's like stepping back into the dark ages."" They all hate it once they have tried InDesign."

49828,0,"Power Chinese is a rather old program for Windows. My newer computer had difficulties with the software because of how it runs in Windows. I would recommend that the company update their software, because nobody will really know how well it will work on their computer.This being said, if it DOES work on your computer it is rather good. The program is not rigorous, and seems repetetive, but it really works to help you slowly remember characters you've seen. This is by no means a good stand-alone program, and should be used in combination with Chinese classes, audio tapes, and books. It is self-paced, so you can go as quickly or slowly as you'd like and then come back later to where you left off.This program requires computer-sit time, too. If you're not willing to set time aside each day for this then it is probably not worth your money. Overall, it is another good tool in language acquision."
55392,1,"I read all of the negative press this year on the new product activation technology, but went ahead and used Turbo Tax Deluxe based on my past positive experience. The software works great and I had no problems with product activation. The interview process is easy to understand and the error checking function stopped me from making a mistake in my federal return. Additionally, I used the e-file feature for the first time this year and it worked flawlessly. Intuit spends millions of dollars every year to create a great piece of software and they have every right to protect this intellectual property. Many of the complainers on this and other sites probably don't realize it, but this protection technology is used by many media and technology companies."

65759,1,I've bought this with The leopard OS for 2 Mac computers. It is cheaper than buying 2 (single user) iLife :). It is fun and easy to use. My brother was able to create a nice DVD of a couple of family events with some cool effects.
27492,1,"The graphics have gotten even better in this game! It's not really that freaky but there are parts that it is. And once you finish the game, it's fun to replay it and do stupid stuff like kill yourself or get yourself kicked out or something like that. As usual, the features of the game are still impressive and ever improving. As for the challenge of the mystery game? It's a pretty good challenge all right because you're timed! Only 3 days for you to solve the mystery. Well you don't really get timed until the very end, but still. Very pressuring that is. The puzzles are quite...puzzling as well. It's a great game for people of ALL ages and a fun game too! Buy it today!"
5397,0,"I loved Appleworks for OS9. It provided a straightforward, easy-to-use word processor, spreadsheet, database, and illustration tools at very reasonable cost. Appleworks had everything anyone would need for home use -except the ability to read or write MS Word documents. I used Appleworks for personal projects, though, because it was a pleasure to use. Appleworks 6.2.9 for OSX is an entirely different animal. It's buggy beyond belief. Apple shouldn't have released software that has not been successfully upgraded for their current operating system. (I don't know why Amazon is still selling 6.2.7, as I bought 6.2.9 months ago. But the two versions have no obvious differences.)The good news is that Appleworks can now read MS Word documents...sort of. When you open a Word document, it launches TextEdit. You can read the document in TextEdit and modify it if you like. But tabs don't translate well. If there are columns created with tabs, the document will be indecipherable. Other nice features (that are not new) include a convenient thesaurus. It's not comprehensive, but it is good enough to be useful in finding definitions and alternatives to words. It's easy to turn off ""Smart Quotes"" in Preferences, and one click of the mouse will make it the default. No need to create a template. The spellchecker works when you tell it to, not while you're typing.Creating a good-looking document and, in fact, knowing how it will look when printed is a frustrating undertaking. What was so simple and easy in OS9 has become a challenge in OSX. The first thing you will notice when you begin to create a document is the size of the document window. Appleworks' windows no longer open to a usable size. They are small. So first you must resize the window using the zoom percentage tool in the lower left-hand corner. 125% should be about right for most purposes. Then, for word processing, you will need to select ""fractional character widths"" in Preferences, if you'd like to be able to read what you've typed. Otherwise most fonts will display with gaps between some letters while others are on top of one another, making it impossible to see the periods at the end of sentences or to tell which spaces between words and letters are real. Oddly, even without fractional character widths enabled, the document will print without odd spaces. Fonts also print much heavier than they appear. Type looks wispy onscreen and barely legible in some fonts, but they print fine. That's not much help if you can't see how it will look as you are creating the document.Some lines are missing the last couple of tabs on the line, making it impossible to use tabs to line up text on the far right side of the document. The cursor jumps down to the next line before it should. I have disabled the .cwk suffix in Preferences, but it still appears on some documents, and I cannot get rid of it manually. The font menu sticks and is difficult to scroll down. The spellcheck window appears inconveniently at the very bottom of the screen. It can be moved, but it is far too small and cannot be resized. Appleworks won't save documents with backslashes in the file name, although you can inexplicably add the backslashes later.None of these problems were present in Appleworks 6.0 or 6.2 that I had for OS9. I experimented with Appleworks 6.2.7 and 6.2.9 in an Apple store to make sure I didn't just have a defective copy and found the same deficiencies. So I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend Appleworks for OSX, although I enjoyed using it in OS9. I couldn't say how 6.2.7 or 6.2.9 perform in OS9, but I wouldn't risk the upgrade if I still had OS9. I would copy Appleworks 6.2 and install the upgrade on one copy only, to see how it goes."
85133,1,"I love the idea of multiple litterz, and all the new stuff, but 1,2, and 3 were better, quality wise. The animation was much better, and I like the ""toy closet"" instead of the idea of ""'fun' mini games."" They wern't fun. When I was little, I got catz 3 and I was sad that it didn't work on Windows XP. If you have Windows 95/98, get catz 3, but if you have XP or ME, this game is your best bet."
58303,1,"Mom's review: I bought this for my 10 year old daugther, and she loves it. While she hasn't solved the case yet she has enjoyed hours of finding clues and moving through the case.Persistence, and thinking carefully pays off with this game. So do good notes. The graphics are great and Nancy's magnifying glass changes color when directed at a clue or direction in which she can moveKymmi's review: I really liked &quot;Secrets Can Kill&quot; It's really exiting when you hear the freaky music when you're alone in one room. The way you talk to someone when you're Nancy Drew is so cool they actually give you choices on what to say. I would rate this Cd rom an eight because it's a really good game but it's realy hard and adult. Because I'm only ten. But if I were 12 or 13 I would rate it a 10."

Another biology reference that I found helpful was:The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations Volume 1 and Volume 2 by Patrick LeonardiThese two volumes made learning the five kingdoms, genetics, plant form and function and heredity easier.

62971,1,"...and I have been computing since 1981! Versatile, powerful, and very user-friendly; none of the other programs of the type that I've tried have equaled it.Unfortunately, my new Windows 7/64 bit laptop is not at all compatible with this program, and I've been told by other users that even Vista rejects it (although a few claim it still works with their Vista computers). Also, MGI has been absorbed by a company named Roxio, and the possibility of a fix is not very likely. There is reportedly a new version from Roxio (PhotoSuite 8, I think it's named)that has been criticized by some reviewers as a poor replacement for PhotoSuite 4; I have not tried it yet, and have no plans to do so in the near future.So, if you are still running Windows XP or earlier versions of that operating system, you're in luck, at least until you have to purchase a new computer.Like the song went: ""You don't know what you've got 'till it's gone""!"
60059,0,"For some reason the program works for me. I have a P4 (3Ghz) with 1GB of RAM. Available HD space is about 40 GB. I made a 75-minute video with added transitions and sound and burned it to a DVD, it took about 3.5 hrs. to complete. The computer ran very slow during this process. Tech support said the software must complete the ""rendering"" process twice before it will burn to a disc. Personally, I think the minimum hardware requirement is a fast P4 with 1GB of RAM and lots of room on the HD, anything less may lock up the computer. I also downloaded the latest patches. The program will still lock up my computer at times... Steve"
61250,1,"Don't think about video capture cards, going into the operating system, or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power, plug Dazzle's USB plug into your usb port, and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on Dazzle, install the software, and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting.EXCELLENT quality, and they will lower the quality if you want a smaller file - like, say, if you want to back-up your vcr to a cd-r. The test for quality is time - tell it to record to 70 minutes, and your work is DONE.I REALLY like the fact that the software is so stable, I recorded a SIX HOUR VCR tape using a 512 meg XP machine - not a moment's problem.They also included software that makes editing these video files real easy, if you want. That is just icing on the cake.Strong, solid, silent - the John Wayne of VCR to computer file translator tools.As an aside, I have held onto some VCR tapes for years, one for more than a decade, hoping something like Dazzle would come along.Prayers answered.Just shut up and BUY it."
49674,1,"I have been using Act! since Act! 2000. Upgraded to 2005 which was a huge adjustment for me. Just upgraded to 2007 so that I can sync with Quick books. 2007 is pretty much the same as 2005 in which they told me it was 35% faster. Not sure in what regards but anyway.....I loved the speed of previous versions (2000) but I love the new features of Act even more. Import and export to Excel and the opportunities features are a definite improvement.I did call about the QB's integration program to a fellow in India which annoyed me since I was able to troubleshoot it myself while on the phone. He was just reading from the manual. My previous installs of 2005 were horrific. 2 weeks to get it up and running. This install of 2007 was a piece of cake. I do find that if I have an issue such as updates not installing and such that I can go to their website, type in the error code and it will walk me through it. Use tech support as a last resort.I have looked into other CRM's but none have the features and integration of Act!. So, for now, I will stick with Act!. The 4 stars should be 3-1/2 in actuality.

41518,1,"If you are looking for a software solution to organize both your contacts and day-to-day operations, this is it. Shortly after the first version of Maximizer was released, I performed an in-depth comparison of an In-House developed system, Act, Goldmine, and Maximizer. Maximizer was the better product in terms of ease-of-use, flexibility, and capability. I recently repeated that same analysis and determined Maximizer clearly remains the best choice.Maximizer has allowed me to do the work of an entire team - making the company seem much larger to the outside world while making each client and potential client feel as though he or she is my most important account. How? 1) By giving me total, instant recall of all past conversations and events for tens of thousands of contacts. In the few seconds the receptionist is transferring the call, I can pull up the contact and review his entire history in terms of past conversations, meeting notes, documents and unlimited user-defined fields customized to my operation, 2) By giving me the ability to easily email quotes or other information which the person often receives while he or she is still on the phone with me, 3) By allowing me to attach and save those quotes or any type of electronic document to that client, 4) By giving me the memory of an elephant - enabling me to schedule contact reminders, some of which may be more than a year into the future, 5) By making it easy to quickly print labels and merge contact information for mass personalized mailings, faxes, or emails. The size of the project makes little difference. A personalized message can be sent to 20,000 people as easily as it can be sent to one person, 5) By continually embracing and integrating new technology into the system, 6) By allowing unlimited contacts per client thus reducing data entry for new contacts... I could continue the list for some time, but by now you have probably gotten the point. I'm completely sold on this application....For only a few extra dollars, Maximizer 5.0 or Enterprise will add more time saving and business organizing features. Version 6.0 shows even more promise.To summarize: I would enthusiastically recommend this tool to my best friend while hoping my competitors never find it.(In case you're wondering, I am in no way associated with the MultiActive company or Maximizer.)"

32539,0,"Having just purchased a 3D television and a 3D Blu-ray player, I needed some material to see just how cool this new technology was. I bought this video primarily based on the reviews I found here on Amazon and because I wanted to see something -real- that was filmed in 3D, not a cartoon that is, on some level, bound to be unrealistic.The 3D here was somewhat cool but very artificial looking. Rather than having fleshed-out dimensionality it looked like a few layers of 2D cutouts presented front-to-back. Yes, there was depth between objects but the objects themselves had no substance. I disappointed with the results and thought that perhaps this is a natural limitation of the technology - until I watched the underwater feature ofIMAX 3D Triple Feature: Galapagos, Into the Deep, Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs (Blu-ray 3D), which was just stunning. Now I realize that the 3D effect just wasn't very natural looking on this disc.The material is certainly interesting, if not a bit dated. It's fascinating to see just how -large- the inside of the ISS is and watching people float along with real left-right perspective gives a good sense of scale. It does seem that the filmmakers overdid the parallax for most of the shots which gives the 3D stage a rather hokey look.While the subject material is interesting, this wasn't the ""3D Demonstration Disc"" that I was hoping it would be."

When you have trouble solving a problem, it shows you how to do it step by step, or you can use the built in calculator.You are a green charactor in a ""spooky"" mansion, where math awaits you in traps(complete the problem and get out of the trap) and in your missions. Yeah, it's cool.I am in 5th grade."

46855,1,"Ever since I switched to an operating system that doesn't hang, crash unexpectedly, or cause my peripherals to randomly stop working (Mac OS:X) my wife has hounded me to replace the one piece of the MicroSoft Office Suite that she used on a regular basis: Publisher.With the advent of Printfolio I was finally able to do so for her. In fact, this OS:X native application not only works BETTER than Publisher ever did, but it is also natively intuitive. Publisher, because it was a third party software that was purchased by M$, had consistency problems. For example, context menus that were brought up by right clicking on objects were different than the rest of the Office Suite, and objects behaved differently than in other parts of the Suite as well.Printfolio doesn't have these idiosyncrasies. In fact, within twenty minutes of taking it out of the box I had designed fantastic, professional-looking DOUBLE SIDED business cards using an imported photo, WITHOUT using a template (of which there are literally HUNDREDS to choose from.) It was so easy to use that I couldn't believe I was done so swiftly and went on to make my card look ridiculous because all of the tools are so easy to use. (Resist the temptation!)So why only four stars? Well, the Printfolio comes with an extra CD-Rom which is 900MB of ClipArt. For some reason this would not install properly on my Powerbook. Installation would hang at 88% and then quit with an error message ""Install Failed"" and no other explanation.So, the SOFTWARE seems to work admirably, but the EXTRAS failed. Since I purchased this specifically for the software and could care less about the ClipArt, this doesn't really affect me, but it might be a problem for you.I strongly recommend this software for anyone looking to replace Publisher with the Macintosh.~D."

Many of the problems have already been described and my biggest complaint is the transition time time between photoshop and the editor. However, once in any place the product does shine.

That night tried to get back to the hotel that was saved as a favorite. The route did not follow the recommendation of the local's, but it should get us there right?(could not get it to use MAJOR highways). Well down the road we go and part way to the hotel in the middle of the road it stated we needed to turn left (IE there was NO road to turn on to). Keeped going and it recalculated the route, next exit turn around go back the way we just traveled to the turn left with NO ROAD to turn on to (we are lost now late at night with most every thing closed). Found a 24hr gas station and got direction which forced us to use a toll road! Did not use Tomtom the rest of the trip. Have use the tomtom site for support with email replys, they MUST be ""outsourced"" as they don't answer question or only one of severial and can't even answer simple question like how to MAKE the route go to a different way (found this on my own (not straight forward), due to NO SUPPORT).Last item is the POI fonts are to large and the screen does not scroll right/left to see all the word's (NO answer from support again!)Looking at Copilot for PDA's (they will give you a credit other software)."
73265,1,"I have used Frontpage and Dreamweaver in producing web pages over the past few years. Most of my sites have moved to dynamic webpages using PHP/MySQL on Unix based systems. Adobe GoLive has great support for PHP and MySQL on an OSX based system allowing one to develop sites locally and test them before deployment. This is a cool feature mainly found on the Mac OSX version as I have not used this program on a windows Machine. The closest I come is running Windows 98SE via Virtual PC.If you use a work group to create webpages, the Adobe WebDEV server is great for manageing changes amoung the different designers. WebDev took a couple installs to work correctly on our MAC workstation that doubles as our development/test server, but once it was set up, it has been easy to use and stable.The one feature that Golive lacks compared to DW is no intergration of BBedit text editing software. There are still some mac coders that can't live without BBEdit and I am one of them. The lack of cross support with BBedit is why I gave this a 4 star rating instead of a 5."

The next week, i popped in the disk aftr playing the game a lot to find out that it was getting boaring after a week! I found my self not making animals and animal shelters but building rollercoasters and pools.I would say to not get this game unless you are a hard-core rct3 gammer like me.

2427,1,"Even BetterI bought the first title Learn to Play Chess with Fritz and Chesster about a year ago for my son and he liked it a lot. He likes it so much that I got curious and started playing it myself. This software really taught me how to play chess so easily and in such a fun way. I did not play chess when I bought it but I do now!When I saw on Amazon that there is a sequel available I ordered it right away and I have to say: It is even better than the first one.If you know the basic rules of chess you will learn so much with this program so easily. There are 21 games within the game that teach you everything you need to know in order to play chess better. You learn about opening strategies, forks and skewers, pinning, castling, deflection, square rules, and, and, and...The story is a lot of fun and makes you go through the games and learn because you really want to help free Chesster from the evil King Black (he is really evil).Like in the first title the training mode comes with ten levels of difficulty from very easy to very difficult. But this version comes with a really nice coach function giving hints and tips while you play. Also, you can now reverse the board so that you can play with black at any time.I also really like the graphics and the whole atmosphere the game provides. It really makes chess a game you want to play.This program should get 6 and not just 5 stars."
89378,1,We bought this for our 6-yr old girl and 2-yr old boy. They have plenty of other toys and computer games but they choose to play this every day. There is a lot of variety in the activities and Hasbro did a nice job in offering challenge for older kids but also making it mostly foolproof for young children. This is the coolest piece of children's software that I have seen. My only caveat is that the game has little educational value -- it's for playing not learning.

While the product has a pretty rough user interface- as far as I can remember, not particularly improved over the previous, free version of Groove- it still beats using a shared folder or (shudder) e-mail as a way of keeping our work in synch. It easily saves me enough time and aggravation to be worth the price."

It's inside the acquarium with the fish. Two things I don't care for are the number of fish allowed at one time (only 7) and that the clock has a logo on it. The instructions say I can deminish the logo size, but even though I have followed them carefully many times, the logo size is unchanged. Nevertheless, it is a pleasing, visual treat and I like it best of all my screen savers."

86052,1,Garmin Map Update 2008 City Navigator for North America NT (010-10989-00 and 010-10989-50)As I read the other reviews I expected to have trouble with this program and I did. You must have all info with you and expect to call then for help. The help line was helpful as if they had this type of problems all the time. There software protection is extreme to the point that it will bring in the program hackers. The upgrade worked and my unit is much better than it was. The errors I have seen so far have been small ones. This is a good upgrade for an older unit. Unlock code only good for one unit upgrade. I now have three different Garmin units that I use. With the price of the upgrade (Close to the cost of some new units) and it is only good for one of my units I will be looking into buying a different brand next time.Prof. Gadget
15172,1,"I am a professional multimedia artist, and have been using Bryce and Poser since they were first released in the early 90's.Bryce was the first affordable 3D landscape and rendering tool available to the masses. I played around with it and was most impressed by the interface. As I design user interfaces for software applications, I know quite a bit on the topic. Bryce, in my opinion, still has one of the best interfaces of any 3D software I have ever used. Newbie's and pros alike will enjoy the simple and elegant interface. Once you get used to it, you will be slightly annoyed that others have not followed it's design.With the release of version 4.0, Bryce became more than an interesting 3D tool, it became a serious contender among 3D applications. It must be said that Bryce is not a 3D modeling tool, per se, I have seen amazing things modeled in Bryce, by extremely patient people who fully utilize the Boolean functionality. I do my modeling in other programs and then import them into Bryce for rendering. Many 3D artists use multiple tools to get the job done and Bryce is a excellent addition to anyone's 3D toolset. Most notable in 4.0 was the addition of animation.With the release of version 6.0, two major things have happened, the rendering engine has improved dramatically, making render times much better and now it is seamlessly integrated with DAZ Studio, which could eliminate the need for preparatory work in Poser, as DAZ Studio is free! Now you can prep your figures in DAZ Studio and simply click on the Bryce icon to switch over to Bryce!I can't say enough about this program, I use it for 95% of all my 3D projects, for rendering and animations. See my website for dozens of examples.I have rendered scenes ranging from forests and deserts to space... the only limit with Bryce is your imagination. There are other landscape software packages like VUE, that can do some things much better, but for the price, versatility and ease of use, Bryce is still a heavy contender.For my part, Bryce will always have a place among my 3D arsenal."

2075,1,"After a hitch free install, Windows ME has yet to give me any major headaches after around 2 months of use now (got a copy from Tech Data before the official release date). My system is a Duron 700, 128 MB RAM, Asus A7V, Geforce2 MX, SB Live!, and IBM 75GXP 30 GB ATA-100 Drive. Aside from some minor DUN problems (most of which were likely caused by an ISP upgrade and a flaky winmodem), Windows ME has yet to be the nightmare it has been for other users. I did nothing special, just simply did a clean install on an empty drive, and have had no problems. I admit I haven't stressed it out much, but I would consider my computer use that of the average net/game junkie, so I've been somewhat surprised reading the other reviews. Maybe I just got lucky with a configuration that WinME can handle with no hassle. From my experience I can say for me it is more stable than Win98B (I have yet to experience a B.S.O.D., and only a couple of random lockups...pretty good for Windows, IMO)"

45926,1,"Very easy to install, it runs smoothly and my 3 year olds are enjoying it immensely. Very entertaining as well as educational."
35645,1,"my advice is to make sure you need it before you buy it, but if you know you need it, then buy it. How will you know? If you need it, you would already know that you do. If you don't know that you need server version, then you probably don't need it. Most day to day tasks are done by the normal version of the os in ways that are much simpler than the server tools. Now you do get a variety of nice things with the unlimited client, such as server managment systems, monitoring systems, etc., but if you are just doing a basic install without a complex networking or users/groups system, then you probably should try to do what you need to do with a 10.1 or 10.2 and see if you actually have to own the server. I would say the ideal application of a server install is for a medium to large lab install using netboot, where the actual cost of doing it via server will lower the TCO significantly."
393,1,"Basically like the program - Word is particularly useful in a world where anyone who wants to send or receive a document from you probably already uses it. Entourage is a more usable organizer than the Palm desktop in terms of material you can record in the various tasks, appointments, etc. (Palm's is prettier, but only a bit.) The big problem as of this writing (6/10/02) is that we STILL can't sync Entourage to Palm. As far as I'm concerned, that makes Entourage not-yet-usable, since daily syncing with a Palm is, for me and probably most users, an absolute must! So basically I've bought a word processing program with a convenient but, for the foreseeable future, useless (albeit elegant) desktop organizer. Wish it had a database program, too... in theory, Excel can do that, but it's nowhere near as friendly as Appleworks' database program."

Major problems encountered include clock setting at 15320 (instead of 2002)-outlook not letting you open certain hyperlinks(the kind for example in a newspaper which lets you link to an article-does let you connect with url's.) And the biggest problem is getting an HP 6300 Scanner to work. Nothing HP has lets the scanner connection survive past the first reboot. Tried all the tricks they sent, the XP software, and the patch put 5/30/2002 that is supposed to fix this problem. HP needs to get it together and fix this. Scanner still works on my other ME system. Finally, it does not seem to like to start other users and run DSL-only likes the first one put in. Other that that, I like-very smooth."

77385,1,"The original title of my review was going to be ""snookered again,"" but I've since had a change of heart (and sound card). I originally purchased Dragon NaturallySpeaking version 4 years ago which was a total piece of junk. Upon hearing a short review on NPR, it sounded like things had improved.First off, caveat emptor. You need a good sound card. Nuance is not very helpful here. Their website/docs simply state you need a Sound Blaster 16. I don't know if it's occurred to them you can't purchase a Sound Blaster 16 card anymore (nor would you want to), and they should just bite the bullet and present a list of cards that work well (like they do for microphones). I bought a Sound Blaster X-fi XtremeMusic which seems to work. Second, you need a hefty machine. For me this is a 2.4 GHz dual processor XP workstation with a gig of RAM. The box says you can get by with 512 MB of RAM and a 1 GHz processor, I'm not sure I believe this.Once you have the right hardware in place the software seems to work fairly well. This review was dictated using the software. However, I'm not giving them five stars because they still seem to suffer from poor software engineering. As an example, take the set up and training process. I was waiting for a new sound card to arrive and thought I would try using my onboard sound card built into my Dell. The setup process did claim that the sound quality was insufficient. Unfortunately, navigating out of the process was impossible leaving me stuck at the ""welcome to general training"" screen. When the new sound card arrived, Dragon was still stuck looking at the on board sound system and had no UI to allow me to use the new sound card. My only solution was to disable the onboard sound system which luckily forced Dragon back into configuration mode where I could reselect my microphone parameters. A second example of amateur software development was an error message (""can't load compatibility module"") that is caused by Dragon's attempt to build a link between icons on the desktop and voice commands. This message wouldn't be so bad if it were not accompanied by random crashes (""dragon is unable to respond, please close all applications using...""). A recently posted knowledge base article states that the error message only comes up if links are invalid on the desktop, and suggest removing things using RegEdit (I kid you not). After uninstalling a SonyEricsson desktop link that I wasn't using, the message went away along with the random crashes.In summary, Dragon has matured from snake-oil ware (v4) to usable. However, they need to make an investiment in the non-voice rec modules of their software."
86463,1,"With this software you will be able to edit in professional level pictures you have taken and they will look with a real professional look. very intuitive and easy to learn, Capture NX is a not expensive solution for you editing purposes. However, the real potential is when using Nikon's RAW format, beause if using a simple JPG picture, not all the possibilities are available. But still, you can imprve a lot those pics. One of the problems I have found is when trying to edit pictures taken with a HP still camera. Due to the compression format they use, Capture NX will not open them. But using other brands like Kodak, Fuji, Sony, Canon or Casio, editing will be just a few clicks. As it uses a non-destructive edit system, you can undo many changes without risking the original file. I think it s a good alternative if your budget does not allow you to buy a copy of Photoshop. Capture NX offers a very precise and accurate edit just in one part of the picture if you need it, or work with the whole image. It requires some time to really know how to operate this program, but you can be sure it would be less than other edithing software."

45594,1,"Comic Life Deluxe is an ingenious piece of software that is designed to help you layout and create comic strips using your existing iPhoto library, or by capturing images with an attached iSight camera. You can use it for a variety of other tasks if you choose, but it is primarily built for fun in creating comic strips.It has the same look and feel of the interface used in most native Mac applications that use an integrated system allowing you to work with your iPhoto albums. You just drag and drop your photos onto your page where you can instantly ""comicify"" or digitally alter your photos to look like comic drawings. There are many different filters and effects included. The built in fonts, templates, word/thought balloons, and page layouts provide a wide array of choices and options and everything works on a simple drag and drop method.When you are finished you can print, export to HTML, save as PDF or publish directly to your .Mac account and share your comics with the entire world. From what I can tell, this product appears to be rock solid and very intuitive. If you are familiar with iPhoto, iMovie or iDVD, then you should have no problem finding your way around in this program. It provides all of the basic tools you need to allow your imagination explore the depths of your creativity. I love it. One of the best apps I've ever purchased for a mere $30."

No but really, decent game if you love Sims but it's addicting and sometimes VERY annoying especially when you can't finish you $10,000,000 blockbuster because your maintenance guys are no where to be found. Or, you haven't hired any but thats not your fault! You've been working on the next Matrix knock off set in the middle ages. It's going to be great Neo renamed David for the time period has to save the world by flying! It's awesome. You could watch it on ""The Movies"" user created content website if I weren't too much of a slacker to upload it. Have fun playing if you do buy, but I'd highly recommend getting Screenwriter instead and putting your brainpower to actually production work that may turn into a B movie deal someday. AH-"
91488,0,"AW is a great tool, albeit an aging one. Adobe refuses to discuss any plans for continued development of this product, so keep that in mind before you spend $2k on a product that very well may be shelved by its developer (the last major release was in 2004). I have used AW for years and love it, but I'm increasingly seeing clients and fellow developers moving on to other tools due to a lack of development and uncertainty as to its future. It's a great product, but I would do some homework before purchasing it."

58048,1,"The mystery game, The Curse of Blackmoor Manor, is truly a fun and entertaining game. But you must realize that when it says. 'For adventerous girl's 10 and up.' You should really pay attention. Very suspensful and anticipating. You need a lot of logic to figure out the many puzzels. Make sure that you would not be scared because at parts, the game made me jump out of my skin!"
26050,1,"I have been using Homestead Professional for months and I have nothing but praise for the site-hosting software. My restaurant's website is so professional looking you would never guess that I built it myself in a matter of hours.Homestead makes it easy to build a website from scratch. It is like using MSWord or Powerpoint. I just used my company logo, combined with the standard Homestead tools to make my website professional, simple, and easy to navigate. In fact, the Homestead software includes a navigation bar tool. When I want to add a new page to my website I add it once to the navigation bar. Now that new page can be viewed from ALL of my website pages.Check out my website at ... and you will see what I mean."

You can not limit the range of the search to one county or for the specific travel place.3. Very poor import from the internet interface (i.e. from maps, sites)."

So it's the other two's job to find them.They find themselves underground and have ended up in the plant peoples lair.It's the cluefinders job to find their friends and stop the plant people from destroying earth! I recomend this game to kids who are in 5th or to kids who are going into 6th.
93335,1,Very happy with this software. Makes designing pattern easy and it great to see your design in full color.
8638,1,"Over all this software is very good.The software does crash. But not as often as other reviews make it appear. Also, I had to download the latest update manually because it couldn't auto-magically figure out my internet connection is persistent.My experience with this can be summed up easily. It is easy to use, when you have a question or you are at a loss, the answer is already on the screen or one click away.This software was obviously designed with end users in mind. It has a simple layout and it just couldn't be easier to use in my opinion.The reports look professional and clean. I find it hard to believe others were complaining about the final reports. If the reports generated aren't clean and/or professional enough, I would have to say someone is living in a fantasy world. No banker, angel, or VC wants to see animated gifs or pinstripes on a business plan. Please get a grip on reality before you attempt to start a business!All the numbers are integrated and calculated so they are consistent across the entire business plan. If you had to do that manually you would be screwed every time you made a revision to a single entry. You would have to find where that entry was calculated across your entire plan and make the changes everywhere... This feature ALONE is worth the price of admission!The software comes with two books also. No, not user manuals. Books that help you understand more about starting a business and how to plan appropriately.I can see why this is highly recommended. I will recommend it to anyone who is serious about starting a business and wants to validate their assumptions or get funding."

61227,1,"I got the Dazzle to convert several home movies from S-VHS to DVD. The Dazzle was very simple to connect and start capturing. The software that came with the device was not as nice. The direct-to-disk works well, but you can only capture one movie to the disk and it closes it. It would be nice if you could leave the DVD open and burn multiple movies to it. The Pinnacle Quick Start is okay, but it requires several patches to run on Vista, where it still doesn't behave well."
40883,1,"The Trial version (30 days) was so convincing that I ordered the Network version a couple of months later (time to gather the necessary amount of money to purchase it online). Then, I showed it to a friend of mine, an ESL too. He is harder than myself to be convinced that a software is a must-have.Surprisingly, after having tested it a few days long, he asked me to order a second copy for his own computer.As an ESL I need to refresh my pronunciation a couple of weeks before each trip to the USA in order to be immersed as quickly as possible. Now thanks to Pronunciation Patterns, this task has become an easy daily brain exercise.If you download the Trial Version, don't be shy: Click every button. Click every link. Take the time to explore every room of this very big apartment. Every corner of the magic place is worth a visit. All the positive reviews reflect what I think about this wonderful software.I ordered the Network version out of curiosity: Which new features will be added in the future or How to make the best even better? A special thanks for the excellent Customer Service.Last but not least, I ordered a third copy to help little schoolers (9-12) in Africa learn how to pronounce English accurately."
79845,1,"Because of the explosion of video and audio editing on PC s, it is imperative to keep your media drives / partitions in as defragmented a state as possible, and on a regular basis, to ensure speedy and reliable operation. It&#8217;s amazing how much fragmentation quickly occurs on a media drive/partition. or even after applying a Windows service pack, such as SP2.Windows does come with its own defragger, but it can only be run manually and can&#8217;t - unlike Diskeeper Pro - perform a boot-time defrag to get fragmented page files and other difficulties resolved with NTFS formatted drives/partitions, which you really need to be using for media editing, instead of FAT32. The Win 98 defragger is useless unless run in Safe-Mode, but this isn&#8217;t a problem for Diskeeper.This is a well priced product and has many other features to keep your files and drives/partitions in good shape."
71105,0,"My two boys (8 and 6 years old) both really loved this program when we first installed it and couldn't get enough of it. The interface is easy to use and the screen is bright and colorful. The problem was that it just didn't hold their interest. After a few days of playing around with it, they got bored. You can only create very simple compositions and the novelty factor quickly wore off. It's not a bad buy for the money (the ""real"" composer software is much more expensive), but it just didn't have the long term ""playability"" of what I would consider a good software program."
47674,1,"Even if your older now but love charlie brown you can still smile a bit while playing this game. Though it would be best used if it were shared with a younger child who may already like charlie brown/snoopy or someone who has no idea who they are, it will bring fun and smiles to anyone who plays it. While the gameplay is simple, it is something that young kids can do without getting too frustrated and still have fun. Peanuts will always be my favorite cartoon/comic strip, Schulz never talked down to his audience and always portrayed children as the smartest among us. If you think about it when you were a kid you didn't have all the baggage you do now, everything was simple and straightforward. and I can't imagine anyone who reads Peanuts not to find at least one character that they can identify with. I sometimes feel like Charlie Brown, a bit alone and unloved, and even though I try hard, it doesn't always mean I'll succeed, but then at times I am like Snoopy. I never let anything get in my way of trying new things. Snoopy was only a dog but never let that get in his way or doing the things he loved. He never gave up, neither did charlie brown, that's something that will always be good to teach our children, and it isn't too bad to relearn it now that we are adults. This game is fun, and should be shared with everyone, young and old."
44747,0,"I used this for a week in France. In Montmarte Paris, it had me going in circles and kept telling me to make u-turns every 2 blocks. I made a few then realized it was malfunctioning. I used the compass to get to a major highway where it recovered its senses. The pronunciations of French streets with English grammar rules were funny but generally understandable. I use a tom-tom more often and get about the same results in France, Italy, and England. Both units tell you to take city streets that are pedestrian only or take you down one lane, two-way, sometimes scenic farm roads or harrowing mountain roads theoretically to save a split-second or more on your travel time when you might prefer a highway or 2-lane street. The travel time computers on any gps I have used do not seem to factor traffic lights into the equation and obviously cannot predict time lost from having to go off a one-lane road to pass an oncoming car, truck, or bus. The alternative routing helps get around closed, blocked, or otherwise objectionable roads or traffic jams but you have to invoke it at just the right moment for the software to interpret correctly what you mean and not reroute you back to the same place. The maps are much better than nothing but nowhere near perfect. I'd rate it between 3 and 4 stars."
26626,1,"I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews from early on - users frustrated by not being able to update the forms. I have also always done my own taxes, without need of any software. Except, I graduated from school, got married, and bought a condo (took out a mortgage), started paying back student loans. So the taxes were going to be a lot more complicated this year, and I decided to give the software a try.I was very pleasantly surprised by how easy taxes were using Tax Cut (both the State and Federal versions). Basically, I answered the questions the software asked, and the forms complete themselves. When you first run the software, it checks online to download the latest forms (which are available now). Just enter the information to answer the questions. There were also a few deductions I was not aware of in previous years when I did the taxes myself. In a couple of hours, my wife and I were done; printed the forms out, and very happy with the returns we will receive.I haven't tried TurboTax to compare. But for a first time user, I find no fault with TaxCut at all. It seems both complete, and was certainly easy to use."
59200,0,"This program works very well--it was able to detect some viruses on my computer as soon as it was installed.It also helps greatly when downloading, as it IMMEDIATELY notifies you if you have a ""worm"" or other sort of virus. It has even saved me from other viruses sent to my computer over p2p software.I have a decent knowledge of anti-virus software, but I haven't used Norton since Windows 3.11 (YES, 3.11 not 3.1) in 1994.The software works as it's supposed to--it can scan every single file on your computer, skip certain ones if [for some reason] you want, you can query tasks, etc. It also has options like ""file shredder"" to totally erase data off your HD if you need that much security.I honestly haven't tried auto-update with this version, I manually installed; but I have done auto-update with versions in the past.The BAD is that although this program seems to use little resources--ocassionally (TWICE A DAY!) it eats up a TON of your virtual memory for no apparent reason. At first I thought it was some large files I was moving but I've done that several times after and the problem is not specific to that. This problem lasts at least 3 minutes--where your computer will slow to a crawl. CPU usage in ""Task Manager"" will remain low--like 10% or 12% but your ""Page File"" will be huge (500+ mb).This may have something to do with the size of your page file--but that's a ridiculous glitch.OTHERWISE the program is easy to install and maintain, it uses very little resources* except for that HUGE glitch imo. [Windows XP seems to operate at the same level as it does without the program.] The options on how to set this program up are fairly simple, e.g. ""enable system scanning"" to scan downloads, system files, etc.*(The important specs--my computer has an AMD Athlon XP 1800+, 256MB DDR 2100, 40GB 7200 rpm HD + 20GB 5400 rpm HD, GeForce 4 Ti4200)***EDIT: In case anyone was confused I meant I have used McAfee in Windows 3.11 and stopped using Norton's antivirus programs at that time. I've stopped using this program, but it can come in handy when getting rid viruses.Also I meant that I manually installed the program and disabled auto-update [for virus database files] but kept it up to date. Auto-updating in previous software seems to have worked correctly."
49072,1,"I always buy the new Windows operating system when it comes out. To date this is the best one yet. I have had minor problems with prior versions but so far with Vista I have had only one minor problem, I can not get the screen blanker to work. I have not really given it a lot of time to figure it out but I'm sure there is a simple solution which I will find. Other then that I find it to be better then XP Professional. This is a worthwhile upgrade for your computer.GordonP.S.The windows automatic up date fixed the problem right after I wrote the review. It works fine now."

3781,1,"For those of us who don't want to study all the tech verbage and intracacies, emc8 is a great program. What could be more simple than just clicking on the menu item and having the program guide you. I noticed that roxio 8 is in the top 15 of Amazon's top sellers. I think it shows that the program is usable for most people, not just the techies. The slide show creator is broken down into just a few steps. I found there were enough format options though to get a good range of looks. I knocked off one star because the program didn't really work until I downloaded the fix. I would hope that by the time the program is boxed it wouldn't have major problems. The good news is that the fix cleared up the problems."

66194,1,"I've been using components of Lotus Smartsuite since the demise of Visicalc (and THAT goes back a long way.) Compared to other software, Lotus is easier to use, crashes WAY less often (almost never, in fact), handles complicated formatting better, and is all-around easier to use.Lotus 1-2-3 is, hands-down, the fastest spreadsheet program to use. Gone are the ridiculous required mouse movements that infest other programs. A simple /-command and I've reformatted, moved, copied, pasted entire columns, rows or sheets. I can keep my hands on the keys and finish my work, rather than figure out why some editing commands are under &quot;edit&quot; and others are under &quot;font&quot; and others are under &quot;format&quot; - ugh!WordPro is far superior to other &quot;Word&quot; processors for many of the same reasons. I prepare an exhaustive audit and budget report each year with embedded charts and tables. I once mistakenly tried to migrate it to Word, but simply could not tolerate Word's eccentricities. Why did that graphic link to the page and not the paragraph? Why does inserting a line make this graphic move UP and the other graphics move DOWN? Where are the formatting commands - aAArgh! WordPro gives me none of that headache.Given the choice, I would choose SmartSuite over any office suite out there. It helps me get more work done - period."

50636,1,"This was the first scrapbook program I bought and the first thing I noticed was that it doesn't come with much of a manual. It is not user friendly, but once I tinkered with it, right clicked here and there, and basically experimented, I discovered all the possibilities it has. The browse option has allowed me to bring in almost all of my clipart without losing quality, and if there is a white backgound, I simply cut it out. The collages I have created have been so awesome that I am beginning to get requests for side jobs--nice to get paid for something I love to do! My only request (something I have read in another review) is to be able to add frames or shapes in varying colors to border my photos with--the real basic scrapbooking techniques. Other than that, I have to admit I absolutely love it and the final projects are amazing!"

They are virtually the same but it only runs on Intel Macs."
67695,1,"For those seeking to edit photos and paint their own pictures in the computer, this program is a steal. (I don't make web pages, so I cannot comment on that. I imagine the other reviewers know what they're talking about!)However, I do edit photos and I do draw. PSP offers a lot to beginners and experienced artists alike. However, if you have never used a raster bitmap graphics program, PSP can be a trial. But so can every other graphics program out there. Corel's (Procreate's) Painter 7 is a world beater, but the learning curve is vastly beyond PSP. I would recommend Painter 7 for very serious computer artists, but this one will do excellent work for the beginner, especially novice artists. Editing photos is fun, though not necessarily easy, with any of these programs, but PSP designers show a sense of humor with some of the new brushes. One looks like a 3D green and blue blob. I don't know what anyone would do with it, but it is fun to spread across the canvas. Think of painting with a tube of bi-colored paint. The brush engine is far better than the early versions of PSP, but I still don't see any buildup (transparent) brushes. If anyone knows how to do this in Paintshop Pro, please inform me. It's this lack which keeps me from giving it a full five stars, even at the price. Photoshop and Painter handle this easily and it is a property I demand from any painting program- for one thing, it helps make editing photographs much easier. Also, I found this program's handling of layers rather clumsy... maybe it is my fault, but the other programs handle them excellently. If something claims to give great value for the money, then it should at least handle the minimum requirements for the jobs it's supposed to do. There are graphics programs out there even less expensive than PSP, but give Photoshop a good run for its money.Adobe Photoshop is expensive compared to either Painter 7 or PSP and does little beyond PSP for most home users. Actually, it's much more expensive than either one. PSP is a good buy, with a bunch of weird and beautiful brushes."

27748,2,"...and that's all she wrote, folks.Vista is the worst investment I ever made. I would gladly switch back to Windows XP at any time, but then my 8GB of Ram won't be detected and the computer definitely wouldn't run to it's full capacity. Perhaps that's the only appeal of Vista at this point...being able to run so much Ram that no one is actually going to need for another 4 years (and yes I'm guilty of it too). I have had nothing but problems with this OS since the day it was installed.If you're looking to purchase the 64-bit Windows Vista package, make sure that you don't need your computer for anything important. I can get nothing to work on this computer at all. Everything you have probably heard about Vista's compatibility issues is true...virtually everything I've tried to use so far has not worked. This includes important peripherals and necessary programs. With my previous computer dying of old age and the tremendous deal on OEM parts on NewEgg, I figured Vista was definitely the way to go. I am so badly regretting that decision now. We use my wife's 5 year old Dell laptop as the primary computer now since my Vista desktop is basically only good for gaming and nothing else.Here's a list of all the things that are thus far incompatible with Vista. This is all from first-hand experience:- Dell Printers- Limewire- Olympus Digital Cameras- Canon Digital Camera- Various types of USB optical mouse- Dell Jukebox MP3 Players- I-Pods- I-Tunes- Digital Camcorders- Roughly 80% of games created pre-2006 (that I've tried)- Various Dell Scanners- Various HP Printers and Scanners- Various USB-related devices- Various speaker systems- And more every dayI had Vista professionally installed...I don't know what I'm doing when it comes to installations like that so I wanted to have it done by someone who knows what they are doing. When I gave the person the parts and Vista, I thought he was joking when he said ""I'll see you again in about a month when you want to downgrade back to XP."" If I had only known then what I know now. In one month of owning Vista i've had nothing but frustration and anger. The only thing it does well is run World of Warcraft, and my wife is thrilled at the amount of space we have for her Real Arcade games.I probably sound like I'm just whining...well, I'm one of the many who have had nothing but problems with Vista. As badly as my old computer was running before it just died, it still was compatible with everything I owned. Since I ""upgraded"" to Vista 64 with my new computer, I haven't been able to print, scan, load pictures onto my computer, or do anything else that any home office NEEDS.Don't be an idiot like me and get Vista because you want 8 gigs of ram, which you DO NOT NEED for any logical reason. XP 64 works just as good, and you won't have to deal with Vista's rampant issues. Just think of Vista as the Next ""Windows 2000"". Since the new Windows is launching in 2009, Vista is just another Microsoft stumbling block that's costing us too much money and wasted time. I'm glad I bought this trash product OEM and didn't pay full price. This is the worst OS I have ever used. Go with XP and stay away from Vista at all costs."
54732,2,I have used Avery Design pro for a few years already and really did like the things it did.However - for some unknown reason the old (free) program I was using quit working. It was not a demo it came on a disc that I got inside of Avery products I purchased some years ago.Long story short....The new program will not install.After many weeks of working with Avery and Microsoft the only explination is - my installer has a problem.Funny thing is - I have loaded other programs and they worked fine.The last possible cure mentioned so far is - DUMP THE SYSTEM completely and reboot. That sounds drastic to me so I will keep trying to repair the problem.Too bad for these delays.I already have a folder full of saved short cuts with Avery. My wife's quilt club needs some of these things done again. Have no way to replace them without going through it with a picture program that does not work very well.FrustratedRichard M.
7997,1,"I did an upgrade from Tiger to Leopard without reformatting my drive. Though that's not always the most efficient way of doing things, everything went very smooth.The bugs I'm experiencing are specific to applications. If you are an InDesign CS3 user, be ready for some hang ups and crashes. Adobe and Apple are still working on this issue. Though there is one workaround for the ID CS3 crashes that has worked for me through research on this issue. Every time you open ID, just create a new blank document - then go about your business opening an existing file, etc. That seems to work for me - haven't had a crash since I started doing the ""new blank document"" trick.The only other bug I ran across is using my Epson Perfection 3200 Scanner through Photoshop CS3. It hangs up the first time - but when if I force quit Photoshop, and reopen it and perform the same task - all works fine. Other than that, I really enjoy all the new features of Leopard."
54278,1,"When I first got this program yeas ago, I wasn't even close to 90% accuracy. Plus, the results were inconsistent. I do a lot of writing and seminars and I can't type anywhere near as quickly as ideas come to my mind. I still have my old, slow computer - Windows 2000, 866Mhz, and I think 300+MB of RAM but I'm now getting consistent accurate results: 94% - 98% on long dictations. 96%-100% on shorter ones. The biggest difference? THE MICROPHONE!I recently bought a professional, studio microphone specifically for voice. I didn't buy it for Dragon. I bought it to record professional quality speeches and presentations for Web, CD, & DVD. I had abandoned Dragon but decided to give it another chance with the new microphone. Without retraining it, accuracy shot through the roof! So, Dragon is back in the mix.The other tricks I learned (mostly because my computer is old, slow and doesn't have a lot of memory):1. Frequently I make an audio recording on my computer first and then transcribe it--especially if it's going to be long. That way I don't have to worry about Dragon running out of memory on me.2. Having an audio backup is also helpful because Dragon doesn't misspell words. It puts in the word it ""thinks"" you said. If you forget what you said and Dragon's guess isn't close enough, you may not be able to figure it out. The ""Play that Back"" feature doesn't have unlimited capacity and the voice recording doesn't get saved with the dictation.I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 only because even though it does work, you need the right equipment and a lot of training time (or at least I did). It's not ready to go out of the box. I don't think you'll need a $200-$300 professional recording microphone like the one I bought, but I think you will likely have to invest in something."

It was really hard for him not to look down. The skin that fits over the keys is the perfect solution! My 10 year old is doing great on this program. The course has a lesson for accuracy, speed, and also the 10 number keys. Also has 4 games, that are not ""cartoonish"", but yet purposeful and fun. I am also enjoying it to bring my typing speed up, and love the reviews that you can do if you struggled with a lesson. Great, great great!!!"
6697,1,"If your child has played beginning level software and is ready to move on to more advanced gameplay, Humongous Entertainment's Pajama Sam series (and Freddi Fish and Putt-Putt as well) are an excellent choice. These titles take the cognitive tasks up a notch as children must accumulate specific items, navigate a number of locations, and use their problem-solving skills to help new friends and achieve larger goals. Along the way, funny and lovable Pajama Sam will meet a number of nice characters, visit a variety of interesting locations and play mini-games as he completes the larger task of getting a representative of each food group out of a pickle so they can get to an important meeting. Along the way he will solve a lot of smaller puzzles and click on many objects that dance or act out funny events. Specifics change if you start a new game, and you will want to play with your child a few times before they'll be able to enjoy it on their own, so each game is good for hours of fun.This is a fine game in a great series. We have all the Pajama Sam titles and enjoy them all."

49795,2,"I've been spoiled by FL Studio 5.0 and my demo copy of Project 5. A friend of mine was going to let go of his copy of Sonar 4 because he just bought Sonar 5. But he hasn't gotten around to it yet, and in my impatience I ventured into the software aisle of Comp USA looking for an inexpensive tool that I could use to automate the VST control interface of FL Studio while I lay down some audio tracks. I came across Magix Music Studio 10 Deluxe. By the looks of the screenshots and the promises on the box, as well as what few reviews I've found on the product, I decided to give it a shot.I loaded it up and quickly discovered, however, that this kludge of a product had been literally sawed in two. The audio multi-track recording environment is one environment, while the MIDI and VSTi/DXi multi-track recording environment is a COMPLETELY SEPERATE PROGRAM!! Can you believe it? Yes, you can record audio, by loading WAV files but possibly in realtime also, within the MIDI recording environment. But all those nifty audio effects must be loaded up into the seperate program.To make things worse, there does not appear to be a way to specify the default MIDI output device, so the MIDI Out on my MIDI controller is being used as the default device for MIDI playback because it's the first thing it finds. And if THAT wasn't bad enough, trying to use ASIO doesn't work for me because the ASIO drivers keep giving me messageboxes saying ""cannot use clock rate of 44khz"" or whatever. (I guess this is because my sound card--an Audigy--is set up for 48kHz.)And if you're like me, you'll throw up over your computer monitor when you see the remnants of an 80's/90's-looking user interface filling up half of the product's windows. It still uses pixellated two-color toolbar icons that remind me of the days of System 6.x on the Macintosh.I have not done enough tinkering to give it a full evaluation, right now I'm still recovering from the shock factor of how utterly useless this thing is. I should have gone with Sonar 4 Home Studio on the rack there, or Cakewalk Music Creator, or drove over to Guitar Center to pick up Cubase SE, or something, anything other than this.Heck, the Voyetra offering looked to be better than this."
55707,0,I got this package on Ebay for a killer deal and I am glad I did not pay the full price for it.The strength of the package is that it allows you to view your progress and gives your instructor some degree of control. The weakness is that the program is very confusing to work with and not user friendly.On the menu you have to choose from a drop down list of activities. The program gives you NO idea of where to start. Which activities should I do first?The book cancels out some of the confusion. However....the book should have been more practical and more easier to read...too rigid as one person said.I would not suggest this for the absolute beginner.

Manual is nearly worthless--had to buy a separate book that covered VideoWave. Help files just as bad. Final production snagged repeatedly and gave no clue why. Most irritating is that any effects can't be viewed until the video is produced, which is very time consuming. I'd check out other programs first...it's possible that this is the best you can do in this price range."
55832,1,"I've used a number of different backup software and found that Norton Ghost suits my backup needs. It' saved my rear end on several occassions when I needed to recover my hard drive. It's also easy to use and much faster than other previous versions I've had. The thing that really makes me mad at Norton is that I re-installed it several times on my Dell desktop (which gave away with just Windows installed) and then went install it in my new HP Notebook and they cancelled my product key. They assummed that I'm not the same person who bought the product.

76860,0,"We spent two weeks driving and sightseeing in Italy. Be aware that the maps on this microSD are not the very latest from Garmin. We asked the Amazon seller about the version and were informed 2013.xx and received version 2013.10, while the latest is 2013.30. For half the cost of Garmin's latest we felt that the slightly older version would be okay and it was. The product contained all the roads we needed from La Spezia to Martina Franca to Amalfi.We were generally happy with the routing between cities and in newer cities. In older cities with narrow streets and tall buildings the GPS had difficulty finding our location.There was a significant error in the maps traveling east of Caserta. The GPS was sure we were not on the road we actually were on and could not route us to our next destination. The other general routing problem was Garmin thinks some roads are 90 kph roads but were actually 50 kph. Instead of sending us the fastest route we ended up on small poorly maintained back roads.As other reviewers have mentioned be sure to bring a good road map and before starting on the route zoom out and compare the calculated route with your map to make sure it makes sense.Fortunately Italian roads are very well signed, with directional markers at intersections and route numbers at regular intervals. One final complaint about Garmin's maps is that many in-the-country streets have a proper name on the GPS, but on the paper maps and road signs have a route number.Safe driving."

It became frustrating having to go through all of the conversations every time you played the game, especially since the movies were all too long. Plus, it was annoying to see that every place you traveled to was empty except for the main character(s). Another thing I noticed is that the characters' mouths didn't move. It didn't look so good considering that the rest of the graphics looked all right. Other than all that, it's okay for very young girls."

See my review on MS Vista for further details. Tech support has been trying to fix this problem for over two weeks now, and as of my last conversation with them, it will perhaps spill over into three weeks before they are able to make any determination of what went wrong.

In addition I post my photos on Pbase so family and friends can always see the latest photos. I started looking into Digital Asset Management after I started to fall behind on updates of the Pbase photo website because of the time consuming process of managing my collection. In case you have not looked, there are products out there such as Idimager, Imatch, Extensis Porfolio, and many more. I downloaded demos of Imatch and Iview Media Pro and used each only briefly. Although Imatch costs only $49.00 or so and Iview costs about 3x more (around $160) I chose Iview because I felt the interface was just easier to use. Of course this says nothing about the features in each product and I am not attempting a feature by feature comparison because I don't have the time. I do think that Imatch is an excellent product and the few features I am looking for appeared to be available in both products. I recommend that anyone looking to purchase software attempt to download a demo first."

5380,1,"I had been a steady user of Money 2000 first and then, Money 2003. I popped the environmentally-friendly-packaged CD in my computer (minimal packaging, truly) and 5 minutes later, I was looking at my previous data, in the new environment of Money 2004 Deluxe. As for the advantages that it has to offer, I have yet to comment on that: most likely I will write a review about them, when I have enjoyed them for a while.Now, as for the reason I upgraded, that's something else. I had gotten myself a copy of Microsoft Money Deluxe 2003 for Bank One: bad idea, terrible mistake -don't let your banking institution talk you into it! After a few months of using it, I started encountering a super-annoying bug that would cause every single point and click of my mouse in the interface to popup a notice saying that the operation could not be completed. Needless to say that Bank One's tech support was most unhelpful and I ended up dropping the piece of software off of my computer.I was seriously going to switch over to Quicken, but I read a consistent number of very negative reviews about their new version, so I decided to stick with MS Money, plus they were offering an incredible Mail-In rebate that made it almost a no-brainer. So far, no complaints... I will report back in a few months with more comments."
60178,2,Do not buy anything from Pinnacle. Their software deceptively leads you to believe that you need to purchase further programs to burn DVDs.

I have filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive trade policies and knowingly offering defective products.
22662,0,"I've just completed reading the reviews on various home design software deciding which one to purchase. While they all seem to leave something to be desired (not to mention their confusing names and software lineage), you can make a variety of roof types with this software. I have the demo for ""3D Home Architect"" Home Design Deluxe 6 by Broderbund as it says in the About dialog. I assume this is the software included in the suite.Today I made a standard gable roof using the default 20 or 45 degrees, a standard hip roof, a low angle ranch style gable roof of 15 degrees, a ""shed"" style gable roof with two pitches 15 and 20 degrees on each side, one of 15 and 5 degrees. I tried to make a flat roof, but either I missed something or you need to make a gable roof of zero degrees, but it would not accept anything below 5 degrees.The slope can be specified in 1 in N style, N in 12 or percent instead of degrees.The roof tools are a bit counter-intuitive and obscure. It took me a while to figure out how to use them. Although the Wizard is limited to a choice of 20 or 45 degree pitches, if you look at the roof properties, you can specify ANY ANGLE once a roof is constructed. Also, in the roof list there are only 20 and 45 degree pitches listed standard for Hip roofs. But you can change these to any angle.One of the difficult things to notice and get your head around is that these tiny blue squares on the roof selection marquee are how you affect changes to just one section of the automatically generated roof. So to create a gable roof, you need to first create a Hip roof, then select the roof, select the blue square for the end you want a gable, then click Properties, then change the roof type for that section to gable. I know, it is weird, having to change the roof type for just a section when ""gable"" usually refers to the whole roof.If you don't select the blue square you will change the whole roof and just get frustrated.Making a curved roof is also strange. It creates one with Hip style ends. You must select and convert the ends to Gable, oddly enough to create an arched roof with ""gable"" ends where the siding is exposed beneath the curve. You have to get used to working with each end of a roof individually. The end result is unfortunately a kind of ""barn"" style roof that is not really curved. By increasing the radius on sections, I was able to get a smoother curve without flat spots. If you think about it, the radius of a curved roof is wider at the base than the building, so the default radius is not enough. By fiddling with the roof data I was able to make a downward curved oriental gable roof. I still was not able to make a satisfactory curved roof or for it to display truss framing for it. I may try adjusting a double slope.It always crashes when I try to TrueView render the scene, from the diagnostics it apparently is my ATI drivers or more probably the OpenGL drivers. Crashes have been rare otherwise."

48501,1,"ZipMagic always had been as good as/better than WinZip, but now with the newest version it sprints 10 miles ahead the competition. It has never been so easy to inflate/deflate .zip-files. After installation the computer sees zip-files as ordinairy directories so you can browse/copy files in a mouseclick. In this version you can also make self-executable .exe files, which is very handy. There is also automatic virus-scanning (not default, have to turn it on!!!) And a lot more. If you own Microsoft Outlook it only gets better....If you add an attachment to an e-mail it automatically inflates it when it gets to a certain limit. This is really good thinking. There are a lot more options which I haven't told you yet so........ if you do a reasonable or a big amount of zipping/unzipping then this is the product to buy! If you hardly zip/unzip, stick to the cheaper WinZip"
72223,1,"Amazon and other e-tailers are offering it for free after rebate, which is how I picked up my copy.After purchasing my first DSLR recently (Canon Rebel XT - LOVE IT!), I started really getting into photography. The camera included a basic editor and organizer (Arcsoft and Zoombrowser) which are good programs, but I wanted something more powerfull for editing, organizing, and creating things like slideshows and albums. Of course, I want Photoshop CS2, but I can not justify the outrageous cost. So for the cost of shipping, I thought I'd try this out...At the time, I did not realize Studio was not a full version of Paint Shop Pro version 9 or 10 - I have not used either of the full versions, but I understand there are many filters and advanced features missing from Studio that may have been useful to me.Nevertheless, PSP Studio is still very usable and it offers a complete, though somewhat basic, set of features for the beginner. I was up and running quickly, creating much better pictures instantly without spending a bunch of time in help. I was even able to figure out how to select people out of a pic and merge with others, using layers and adding effects. The results were good and I was pleased.In addition to the photo editing features, there are some good graphics creation and editing capabilities that look like they could be fun and useful.I ended up liking Album a lot, though there were some annoyances, like less than optimal, somewhat clumsy navigation. The slideshow feature is nice but feature poor. I really liked the create features. My 3 year old daughter loved the quick-and-dirty photo albums I created after an outing. I liked it so much, I bit on the upgrade offer and ordered version 6 because it included some XTra theme packs that I was considering buying for Album 5.Album 6 is better than 5, especially with the theme packs, and worth the 30 or so dollars if you are looking for a good, but not great, organizer.Both the Paint Shop Pro Studio editor and Album programs perform very very well. Load time is a bit slow (not bad) but once you are up and running, its very snappy and efficient.But less than 2 months into using Studio, I found that I had outgrown it. The photo editing is not as powerfull or full featured as its competitors. Though the basic filters are included (unsharp, add/remove noise, etc) they are quite limited compared to others. One option I was looking for was a levels tool, but apparently it does not exist in Studio.Finally, there is no RAW support in Studio, and neither Album 5 or 6 allow you to view RAW files at all (though 6 includes a basic RAW editor, I prefer Digital Photo Professional that came with my camera).One other thing to consider..there is MUCH more free content available online for users of Adobe products than there are for Panit Shop Pro. When looking for info like tutorials and how-to guides, even when targeting Paint Shop Pro, you find countless Photoshop resources, but limited PSP sites - PSP content is there, but much harder to find, especially for this trimmed down Studio version. Even though much of the Adobe content is for the full CS2 version, much of the feature set overlaps with Elements, so it is often usable (at least for the basic features) and there are still more Elements specific resources than PSP.I downloaded a copy of PhotoShop Elements 4 2 nights ago, and was very impressed. Much better organizer with RAW support, and the editing features and slide show features are much, much better than any of the products I have mentioned, alone and combined. The program is a bit sluggish, but not horribly so, and the interface is nice and intuitive. I'm willing to pay for these new features so I ordered a copy of Elements 4.0/Premier 2.0 bundle.I would give Studio a 3 if it was over the $30 price point, but for free it deserves a 4.If you are just looking for something basic for a casual, family photographer that might even get a little ambitious, or you think you will just be doing basic to moderate editing and organizing, this a really great solution for free. But if you expect to develop your skills as a photographer or want to create more fancy slideshows and such, consider Photoshop Elements 4."
61220,1,"The Dazzle DVD Recorder hardware does a good job of converting analog video into a digital format. My wife leaves unrecorded sections of tape in between shots and these can make it difficult for a unit to frame properly. The Dazzle unit was able to synchronize quickly on the next section of recording although a few frames had to be removed. A previous unit was unable to resynchronize under these circumstances placing the top part of a scene on the bottom.The bargain is in the software that comes with the unit. You get Pinnacle Studio 10.5 which provides a good set of video editing functions. There is a newer release of this software on the market but this version will help to give you a good finished video that can be placed on DVD. The software and drivers are designed for Windows XP. Before doing anything I recommend you go to their web site and download the latest driver for the Dazzle DVD Recorder and the Studio updates. You get version 10.5 of the software. You will need to download version 10.7, version 10.8, and Pixie5Updater. Version 10.8 gives you Vista compatability according to Pinnacle but I have not tried it.Before installing Studio you should download a patch called Pixie5Updater. This solves a compatability problem with Internet Explorer 7. On some PCs Studio will halt installation midway if this patch is not installed first.I have been using Pinnacle Studio 10 before buying the Dazzle unit and paid more for that software than for the Dazzle unit. That is why I consider it a bargain even though there is a newer version."

The toolbars look the same and the icons perform the same functions as Office. PP8 is easier to use than Photoshop and more intuitive.

I find myself turning to PP8 more often than all of my other photo editing programs combined (Arcsoft Photo Studio, Microsoft Photo Editor, Adobe Photo Deluxe and Microsoft Picture It!)."

79097,1,"After reading some of the comments on Amazon, I was reluctant to upgrade our small business to ACT! 2006. However, I eventually decided to take the plunge on the advice of some colleagues.We followed the detailed instructions to convert our corporate database of about 3,500 contacts with detailed notes and histories from ACT! 2004 to ACT! 2006. The conversion took awhile, but aside from the longer than expected conversion process, the installation was seamless.Although the new sync models are a bit tricky to set-up, we have found the new network sync is far more robust than the previous email sync which presented some data exchange issues for our company.Some users, especially with laptops, have noticed that start-up is longer than with our prior version. But, our users are able to perform many other tasks, especially database tasks, much faster than before. Everyone in our organization has at least 512 RAM and on balance everyone is more than satisfied with the overall performance.We were looking at upgrading the organization from v 6.3, because we required compatability with Windows XP and our sales team needed support for the latest Palm devices. A huge unexpected benefit of ACT! 2006 is the significant improvement in company management over ACT! 2004.While Sage can still make some improvements in this product, we are pretty satisfied with our upgrade decision. And, we found ACT! 2006 to be an extremely good value compared to alternatives in the market. We give ACT! 2006 4 out of 5 stars. Sage needs to work a little harder to get a fifth star."

73814,2,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter has been using Disney's Preschool software for about a month without a problem. After two session on this software she found the activities to be too easy, the only difficultly being mouse speed. She has asked to go back to Pooh.The games are not intuitive and there is a lot of verbal instruction. There are also several logic flaws, such as arranging items for a picture and then the picture taken has nothing to do with the arrangement. In the phonics section, if you select the wrong letter the character actually says, ""Wow, that was off. Way off.""I think the whole reward system is too complicated and takes you away from doing the activities. Disney has the same issue, just less so. Software makers should focus on fun educational activities and not on long story lines or rewards."

92189,1,"This product was recommended to me by a computer-expert friend as much easier to use than the usual ones. I am now almost finished with my first website (which includes lots of graphics, pop-up windows, and a music download) and it has really been a breeze. I don't consider myself good with computers, but this program let me worry much more about what I wanted to put on the site, and how I wanted it to look, than about how I was going to implement that. The tutorials in the included ""Getting Started"" booklet are well worth working through, and the ""Using Freeway"" book, also included, goes into more detail -- a refreshing change from those programs that come with zero paper help documentation. And the results look professional -- as soon as another friend saw my half-done first website, he wanted to hire me to do one for him!"

8838,1,"I must come to the defense of the the program based on the other reviews. My son loves it. He has been observed to be at least 6 months ahead of average on verbal and learning skills and is not bored by the program.The slow response to pressing a key can only be caused by a slow computer. Ours is nearly 5 years old and responds wonderfully. As to using it with a 3 year old, it is rated 9-24 months, not 36. Comments by other reviewers suggest that THEY were not impressed, remember it is for the kid not the adult. As to pushing all the keys, be ready to teach your child from the first play to touch a single key rather than bang on it at will. My son learned this on the first day.Give it a try."
34495,1,"Kai's photo Soap is a great product to use to touch up your scanned images, digital photos and especially restoring old photographs. When using this software, it gives you great control as to touching up, clone painting. The tools you work with feel just like you were using a paint brush, eraser, pencil, whatever you are using. It is especially good to use when you are working with an old photograph that is very badly scratched. You can zoom in and clone paint from another source in the photo and once you're done you would never know there was a scratch there."
47886,1,"dogz4 is sooo fun! it seems so much more detailed than other games. for example- you must feed your dogz frequently or they begin to lose weight. also, if you dont keep your house clean and put out bug traps, you'll get roaches! you can even plant a garden! the dogs can even have pupz. it is fun to get to see how your dalmation/lab mix or great dane/dachsund mix will turn out! there are, i think...7 different dog breeds to choose from. i would have given this game a 5, but this game, for some reason or another, seems like it messes up easily. i thought mine was broke, but found out how to fix it fortunately. some people are not that lucky!"

The suggestion was to run searches for( ab*, ac*...za*..) on the titles instead of entire articles. It isnt a perfect solution but it helps.For being the best encyclopedia and its extensive articles I think it deserves to be re-rated. Falling short of perfection with the lack of a contents page, which I hope will be corrected. In addition the tech support from the web sites was very prompt and professional."

Even then, to get really deep into it, you may consider taking a class or getting mentored by someone who uses it alot. It is dramatically more complicated than Garageband, but it has so many more possibilities.Reason is not for the beginner, but if you do start with it, get the support and it won't let you down."
2259,1,"I am a photographer, and Photoshop CS2 has done wonders for me. I can greatly improve the quality of my photographs by just using a few layers. Once you learn to get around this massive program, you will fall in love with it. It is so much fun, and there are a thousands of things you can do with just one picture. I know they have just come out with the new CS3 version, but CS2 is still very up to date, and is worth the money. However, if you have never worked with photoshop at all, getting started can be frustrating. I recommend joining NAPP (National Association of Photoshop Professionals) or taking some classes so you can learn to use the features. Next to my camera, this program has been the best business investment I have made."
84237,1,"Vista 64 is a nice improvement over XP. It loads much faster than XP and in general the interface is pleasant to work with. As with any new os release there are adjustments to be made. The control panel components, while essentially the same, have changed just enough that you will have to explore it to find the same components that are in XP.In order use Vista, however, you will probably have to upgrade your computer. The upgrade, for many, and depending on your needs, probably means a new system to include at least the following: 256mb PCI-E video card(I chose a 512mb XFX); 2gb ram (I went with 4gb to meet my needs for rendering video projects); core 2 duo cpu(I chose a 2.4 chip) (or AMD equivalent). To use these, you will need motherboard that supports the above. (I'm using an ASUS P5B-Deluxe because of its dual gigbit LAN and the fact that it supports a quad cpu).You might find that your current scsi equipment, i.e. film/slide scanner, printer, etc. is not supported by either Vista or the compenents manufacturer. Also, currently, my USB Okidata Laser(C3200n) that I purchased a few months ago has no Vista driver available, although Okidata indicates it will in the near future. Therefore I would recommend that if you want to use those components, keep a working copy of XP until you spend more money to upgrade them."

I'm also elated to have Numbers 08 which I think is a very simple program to use, especially for people new to spreadsheet layout. These programs can only get better with time."
88343,1,"I must confess that I am only new to this product, and this review is on the impression I have gained while working through the first (of eight) unit. I have been most impressed with the way in which the material is presented, and how quickly I have picked up words, then phrases, and then concepts. The material very much builds on itself; first introducing nouns, then verbs, the prepositions, then adjectives. It allows you to hear, read, and then identify the concept/phrase on the basis of four pictures (as other reviewers have noted, the pictures are pretty horid, and it's sometimes difficult to identify the correct photo even if you know the phrase). All that said, I am looking forward to seeing how my understanding of Latin grows as I progress through the program.I also purchased Wheelock's Latin and Cassell's Latin/English dictionary. For the time being, I have decided to park Wheelock's on my bookshelf, and instead have been using Rosetta Stone and my dictionary. As an art history PhD, I was forced to learn to read both German and Latin, and thus have a basic understanding of both a romance and non-romance language. I don't consider myself particularly skilled in the realm of languages, but at least this software makes it fun to do.Highly recommended."
10039,1,"Nolo's WillMaker returns to its roots by changing its name back to the original. WillMaker Plus 2004 is an update to Quicken Lawyer 2003. You still get a bunch of general-use legal forms (such as complaint letters, in case, say, you don't like the software!), but what the program really shines is still in estate planning. Through a Q&amp;A process, you can write your own will. I recommend you make a list of your major assets before starting the will-making session, because that'll make things a total breeze. The program includes clear instructions to guide you through the process. You can also create other estate planning forms for things like living trusts, power of attorney, etc. I have always felt the price for the program was a bit high, and still think so, but if you want a comprehensive suite of will-making tools, this is simply the best."

So i played the game, and found out that even though it entertained me, it just wasn't as good as the other games. For some strange reason, after i beat it, i didn't want to play it again.

54994,1,"I purchased TaxCut after reading all of the bad reviews here. I am sorry I did. TaxCut would not update, it has an inferior user interface and it did not figure the best rebate for me on my taxes. I then purchased TurboTax and it automatically figured my taxes with no errors. It even advised me to get an IRA for my wife which turned a several hundred dollar tax bill into a tax refund. It also automatically handled the hard to understand Montana state tax rules which TaxCut did not.Forget the license issues. You CAN run the software on multiple machines (you can only print from the 1st one). You CAN use this software in the future. Intuit's website points out that after Oct 23, 2003 the activation will no longer be required so if you ever need to reinstall because of an audit, YOU CAN DO SO!Buy it, and get the best refund from the IRS (which is why you would buy this software in the 1st place). After you are done, uninstall it, delete C_dilla, and wait for your IRS refund check."
139,1,"I bought this bundled with EZ-Firewall. In spite of the dumb name this AV software is unbeatable. Despite or maybe BECAUSE of it's lean and mean characteristics. It is small, fast and effective.Norton and McAfee should study this program hard. AV programs should be unobtrusive and require little overhead. Norton takes over your system and eats resources like no tomorrow. McAfee is just nagware constantly reminding you of all the great other McAffee products that you haven't bought yet and to add injury to insult it misses things. Before I installed eTrust in one machine I scanned with Norton with the latest sig file, system rea clean, ETrust found 4 virus files on the first sweep after installation! Real ones. (McAfee was better when it was inexpensive shareware)I trust this software and have purchased several licenses, one for each machine. It is well worth it. Scrap the other bloatware, this will make your machine safe and still usable. With eTrust installed I know I am safe.Highly recommended.eTrust just works."
18346,1,"Got this for my 6 yr. old daughter for her birthday and she just loves it. We loved it too because we installed it on our networked computer sytem at home and it worked great the first time - no tweeking required!!

4362,1,Received Garfield quickly and started it the same day. Have been doing the lessons every day and I can see my improvement. The cartoons are great and keep me laughing. I can't wait until my next typing class in school to show the teacher.
1828,1,The game was fun for my 3 yr old and 6 yr old for about 2 months and it did teach them about 3-D graphics so I would still recommend this product. It's pricy but after your kids are done w/the software you can always send it to their cousins! It arrived on time and as pictured so I'd buy from this seller again!
43099,1,"I am liking the Office Home and Student. I wish however that it wasn't so different from the last Office home. It is not impossible, but it takes a while to figure out things I used to do with ease. Now I waste a little time trying to do the simplest things. Unfortunately, Microsoft could not say when the new Office will come out, so I got this now. I just hope they give us a huge discount when the new 2010 release comes out."

30955,1,"VideoStudio 11 is impressive. I also suffered through crummy, buggy previous Pinnacle Studio versions. I tried to install Pinnacle 11 on a 4 year old laptop but it complained that my driver was out of date (though it's not) and runs very slowly. Plus Pinnacle still nickel and dimes you for every little function and template that should be included (""you can download mpeg2 functionality now for only $10!"") Adobe Premier Elements 3 would not install period due to having an older AMD processor. Plus Adobe can edit HD - but it can't output to HD formats? Okay . . . To heck with them.Video Studio runs solid and fast, and my old laptop can even edit 1080i HDV just fine with the proxy editing function. The other programs don't have it. Capture is smooth and fast and scenes are detected quickly. Rendering is fast as well. And it has 7 video tracks where Pinnacle has only 2.The other companies are not very up front about their steep hardware requirements. Do your research and make sure you have newish hardware and a good video card and lots of RAM if you go with something else. Especially if you have any hope of editing HD. Ulead just works. Don't bother with the base version though, it's kind of crippled compared to the Plus version.Pinnacle 11 specifically the Ultimate version is still kind of tempting to me but only because it's got a very superior ""Ken Burns"" style pan-and-zoom program for still photos included as an integrated add-on. If that doesn't interest you then forget it."
31367,1,"One of the joys of being a packrat is discovering really cool stuff you forgot you ever owned. The Simpsons Cartoon Studio joins my list of rediscovered gems. I fired this thing up in my XP PC (it's also compatible with Macs) and soon found myself spending more time than I had planned just having fun. It is true, my friends - while you probably won't transform yourself into Matt Groening, you can indeed make your own Simpsons cartoons. It's not inherently easy to do, but with time, practice, and some imagination, you can amuse your friends and indulge the little child in you that always wanted to grow up and be a cartoonist.This software gives you more options than you might expect, especially given the fact it was released way back in 1996. First, you can choose from a total of 35 backdrops, including many beloved Springfield locations, as the setting for your little cartoon adventure. Fill the space with your choice of a huge number of items - furniture, signs, electronic gadgets, three-eyed fish, etc. Once the scene is set, bring on the actors - luckily, you won't have to deal with threatened actors' strikes in order to bring your Simpsons creations life. Almost all of your favorites are here: Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Mr. Burns (Excellent!), Smithers, Krusty, Milhouse, Barney, Moe, Nelson, Flanders, Ralph, the aliens, etc. Each of them comes equipped with a number of different actions and sound clips. Naturally, the Simpsons family members offer you the most options, but you can easily add such elements as Homer running and falling down, Lisa getting down with her bad self on the saxophone, Bart skateboarding by, Maggie plopping down on the ground, Nelson pointing and laughing, Barney burping - it goes on and on. Then there are a number of choices for background music, after which you can add opening and closing credits, screen dissolves, special effects (lots of good stuff here), and basically engage in unrestrained cartoon mayhem.Ah, but things aren't quite that simple, and here is where a lot of home cartoonists meet with frustration. It can be a challenge to make things happen the way you want them to, and the interface is a little clumsy at first. After a reasonable amount of time, however, everything starts to click; you learn how to make the cartoon last as long as you want, how to make that darn piece of furniture stay in the scene from start to finish, where and how to introduce new characters midway through the cartoon, how and when to insert the appropriate voices for your characters' actions, and everything else you need to know to let that little Groening demon inside you out to play. It looks hard at first, but it really isn't. I'm not sure how easily younger children can adapt to the interface, but older children and all those of us committed to remaining young at heart can have a lot of fun with this software. So can your friends, to whom you can send your little masterpieces - whether or not they have this software themselves."

48228,1,"Site Server and it's big sister ECommerce Edition do just about everything any website wants to do. These facilities include Personalisation and Membership, Content Deployment, Searching Multiple Websites and File Locations, Personalised Direct Mailings and a Knowledge Management application. It has a full set of analysis tools that are easy to use and produce useful information and not just pretty pictures.Standard Site Server is primarily aimed at intranet solutions but can be equally easily used for non-ecommerce applications. It would be fair to say that it is complete overkill for many intranet solutions unless you use the direct mailing to staff or want to create a centralised document store of some form. It is not, however, aimed at being a complete document management solution. However, most people have now realised that websites or intranets and just another communication media for your staff or client community and so this product is useful for second generation sites that want to go the extra mile.A lot of the database work is aimed towards SQL Server but the documentation in both Microsoft manuals and third-party books on proper SQL integration is sketchy or contains errata. The product is also so complex that you have to read every line of the Wrox books to make sure you don't make mistakes.Securing your site under NT also create its problems. Part of that is the underlying NT OS and a significant section is the sheer scale of the product. Wrox books on P&amp;M have some information on securing LDAP servers etc., but I have yet to see a 'bible' on security covering this product in particular and IIS in general.Microsoft also seem to have no upgrade pricing when moving from Site Server to ECommerce Edition so carefully evaluate whether to spend the extra money now on ECommerce. It is easy not to activate the commerce pipelines until you are ready.To summarise, implementing this product can scale to a major undertaking but the payback on a correctly implemented site is worth the effort."

Kidspeak introduces you to 10 languages and 10 fun characters. It includs popular Spanish to the rare Hebrew. If all your for is to know how to say hello in Italian than Kidspeak is defientely for you. I love the characters that interact with the gamer throughout the learning experience. They pronounce and sound the words and pharses wonderfully. I've gone through every language on these cds and can say proudly that I know how to count to ten in all 10 languages. To get an idea what exactly you will receive in Kidspeak here you go: Languages: Spanish, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Indonesian, Korean, Hebrew, Chinese, and Portuguese on 3 cds.I'm very glad that my mother got me this game for my sister and I. I learn so much just by clicking on a mouse. Parents, please don't deny your kid's the chance to explore so much and learn new things outside their mother tongue. The games are so rich and fun even for me, a college student.Don't turn down this chance, seriously. I have been in love with languages for as long as I can remeber and Kidspeak brought that out in me."

17188,0,"I have used GoBack Deluxe 3.xx for about five years and have occassionally had it fail catastrophically as others have. I have been successful at repairing and resuming use of my hard drive and GoBack with the use of ""Ultimate Boot CD"" in its various incarnations, last using version 3.4 to effect the fix. You must create this boot CD from a download from the web (see Google). Open UBCD after booting it and select ""File System Tools"" to TestDisk (5.7 was the version on UBCD 3.4), after load select quit and old partitions appear, have it analyze partitions (which have been ""destroyed"" by GoBack), write each to disk (save) and then write classic MBR to first sector. These instructions may be a bit garbled, as I am referring to my own notes; your mileage may vary, but it sure beats buying a new machine (or HD and or OS) or paying a tech a couple of hundred bucks to do what I just described. Takes about half an hour, even muddling through. Try it."
64436,1,"My sister and I got this game out of a cereal box. When we first started playing it, it was pretty much broken. The graphics were distorted, so everything was black or illegible. This made it pretty hard to play word games, and thus the CHALLENGE. One level we had to do completely by randomly guessing, but we were DETERMINED. Also, the villains were scary as all get out, as they would just randomly appear, all fragmented and half-neonish.Then, one day, the game started working correctly. We were elated! Then-we were heartbroken. Word Detective, it turns out, is not nearly as much fun if you can read the words. The games were too easy, the villains were not frightening, and we did not feel the same sense of accomplishment.If you can get your hands on a malfunctioning version of this game, it is a solid 4 stars-perhaps even 5. The game as intended is not worth your money."

The graphics are stunning, the material about dinosaurs is terrific and the progression of levels and different games, makes this software a must have for any youngster.

Based upon the poor reviews of MS Streets &amp; Trips 2004 (crashing etc.) I thought I'd try Delorme instead.Regardless of what you may think of Microsoft, they *do* do a pretty good job of making their products easy to use. Delorme Street Atlas, in comparison, has an odd user interface that isn't easy to pick up quickly."

In 3 months, I have already paid for the price of the software, after rebate, since I cancelled my other Bill Pay. The integration is awesome, and even better since I use Money for the Pocket PC."

39395,0,"Initially I bought this to run with Windows XP and Windows Me since they are both listed as being supported by Amazon. But, after speaking with Sony tech support I have found that Acid 4.0 is not fully functional with Windows ME. When you run this on a Windows ME system, you can not Render a project to a MP3 file. This is becuase there are no supported templates for MP3 for Acid 4.0 with Windows ME. Also, it locks up my system periodically when I try to do live recordings. But, with Windows XP it works fine. And, if you have a Sony VAIO system that came preinstalled with the Deluxe versions of Acid and SoundForge, be advised that the base Acid 4.0 and SoundForge 1.1 do not have the same capabilities. You will have to update Acid 4.0 and SoundForge so you can perform the same tasks as the pre installed software on your Sony VAIO. However, I do like the multi-track editor."
19011,1,"This product was great. Driving around the country roads in England, I did't need to worry about finding my way. can give an address or just a city and follow the directions. When returning my rental car to the airport, it found me a gas station and then back to the rental return. Only improvement is that when going into a roundabout (lots and lots of them in England), it said exit 2 and street name but the signs were the street numbers - A24, etc. Not a big problem if you just listen to and follow second exit though. It also gave an idea of how long the jouney would take so that was helpful too."

55536,1,After purchasing True Image 9.0 I had occasion to contact customer support. After answering my question they told me I could upgrade to version 10.0 for free. I did and like the software very much. After creating a back-up I later used the software to restore my hard drive due to corruption. The restore went off flawlessly.

24799,2,"I bought the item used, so I paid virtually nothing for it. Under those conditions, I'd have to say I'm satisfied with it. But I would not recommend spending any more than you're willing to waste on an annoying, slim-featured, slow and unreliable application.Sometimes it will open an MS document. Sometimes it won't. Because it's java based you need to make sure all your file and folder names, in the entire document hierarchy, follow rigid file-naming requirements. No spaces, no slashes, no special characters, and so on. Even when opening a properly-named document at the root level of your hard-drive, however, at times the document inexplicably opens up as a blank page. A day or two later, the same document might open perfectly. This happens not only with documents translated from MS apps, but with documents actually created in Thinkfree Office itself.The interface and features are more those of an html editor than a word processor, or spreadsheet, or slideshow creator.Although it can be used to create passable alternatives to MS documents, it has very few features of the actual MS programs. Expect problems and inconsistencies if transfering files between Thinkfree and MS Office users. The look and even the data may change in inexplicable ways.It is extremely slow. When you open a document, it will seem as if the computer or the application may have hung up or failed. Even more confusing, you can navigate to the open dialog while the application is in the middle of trying to open a document, so it seems for all the world like the document is not responding. But just keep waiting ... eventually the program will get around to making an attempt at opening the document. If you're lucky, you might actually get a usable document in a minute or two. Or maybe a blank page. You can take bets while you're waiting, if you want to make it interesting.In short, purchase this if you can deal with the annoyances and unreliability. It is useful for trying to open the occasional email attachment. But be aware that this is definitely not a professional-grade software package capable of handling business needs."

78843,1,"I was impressed with the animation and graphics for this game and even more so the storyline and tasks that motivate kids to want to reach the goal - doing every task in the ""city"" (to help the merchants with math) so the arcade can open and the player can spend the money he or she has ""earned"" to play games. My daughter(5 yrs.)is so hooked and her math skills really improved. You can even track your child's progress. My only criticism is that it was a tad bit hard to navigate and figure out how close to the goal she was."
44545,1,"This little SD card saved our vacation. Typically we tend to rely on maps and self navigation, and it makes for a tense vacation when we're arguing over roads that aren't there, places that are impossible to find, etc. This time, we bought the SD card for my Garmin nuvi 660. This little gem got us to the most remote areas of southern England imaginable! Not one of our coastal locations was a problem to find. In one case, we stayed in a ""town"" that was literally three houses amid the moors. No road signs, one-lane roads, and no problem at all with this map! It's worth every cent. We found another retailer who sold it for much much less, but knowing what I know now, I'd not hesitate to pay what retailers here are asking for it!"

33954,1,"My daughter (age 12, and fixated on all things French) has been trying to learn French through a variety of media--workbooks and audiotapes, Muzzy videos, textbooks, none very stimulating--so I bought this CD for her to try.First, let me start with the software itself: it was real discouraging when I first installed the French 8.1 Deluxe edition--kept getting error messages about MicServer Pass (error 26). Had to shut down probably 30 times the first few hours of use. Finally determined that there seemed to be some kind of conflict with other programs/graphics on my system--primarily a Japanese Hello Kitty screen saver installed. ALSO, I learned that you just can't click that mouse as fast as you'd like in the Play/Record mode, because if you click faster than, say, a 5 sec increment, the system freezes. I assume it's because the program just isn't developed enough to handle incoming audio recognition and cursor commands while simulataneously processing video/graphics/data transmission. Well, what do you expect, it didn't cost that much to begin with. So I have learned to slow my mouse clicking down a bit. In addition, I highly recommend you run AdAware, Spybot, and some kind of Utilities Clean-up/Fix program before installing this--and do what the installation instructions suggest, END all other programs running in the background. Finally, I would say that the less processes you have running while you are using this feature, the better!About the program itself: I learned French in middle school, as well as 1 semester in college. (I also have a total of 3 years high school/college Spanish experience). So, based upon my knowledge of foreign languages, and the varieties of media I have used--the classroom, workbooks, textbooks, videos--I would say this software is the most entertaining method of learning a language. My daughter, who has NO foreign language experience, says this system of language learning works best for her, thus far.This program--although not labeled so, take my word for it--is designed for conversational French. The strengths in this program are the French speakers and their pronounciation. Their phrases are short and to the point. In the beginning, the phrases are everyday phrases and the key to learning them is saying them over and over again; basically, MIMICRY [the accompanying 184-page reference book is just a written form of all the narrative you hear on the software, it is NOT a workbook or dictionary]. I told my daughter DO NOT RUSH through this, stick with the same lesson for at least a week. There are optional grammar notes for those interested or for those (like me) who never paid much attention to grammar exercises in school, but they are not the key to learning. After all, you don't see young children reading grammar books and they can speak quite well.The voice recognition feature is not entirely accurate (I said ba-ba-ba-ba into the mic once and it gave me an excellent rating!) but it provides enough feedback so my daughter feels like she is making progress, mainly by copying the French speakers. It trains the ear to recognize French sounds.As you go on in this program, you can pace yourself when things get a bit more challenging. Some of the phrases don't have much to do with everyday life, but they tend to teach the repetition/variation of common phrases over and over again, so it builds on the foundation. Using the program myself, I can determine where I am rusty. Also, I see my daughter decide (by herself and by the automatic scoring) where she needs to go back and review. The interactive functions--visual, written and verbal--really help reinforce what you've learned.I would think that if one continued with the entire program and put as much effort into it as in a class--say, at least 1/2 hour a day up to 1 hour a day on weekends--then, by the end of the CD course one would be quite confident and fairly proficient at speaking and understanding spoken French, or the written level used by a daily newspaper in France."
59193,2,After downoading and installing the software for both the Firewall and the Virus Scan I was unable to use my sync software (Active Sync 3.5)for my IPAQ. After spending an hour with the online chat-support at McAfee the only resolution was to disable the firewall to get a a partial sync on my IPAQ. I still kept getting the message: tcp/ip network transport not installed? I was then directed to MS. No solutions from MS. At this point I uninstalled the entire program and requested a refund. I use my PDA as much as my PC and need a Firewall- Virus Scan program that works within this mini network.
79246,1,"I needed to upgrade my home computer to telecommute from work. I purchased this software to upgrade a Mac Version Excel 4.0. It worked beautifully! I can now transfer files from my computer to work with no problem, even with the work computers being PC! The features are great, all the newest shortcut buttons, and workbook options. I love it! It is absolutely wonderful!I highly recommend you upgrade to the 2001 version, no matter what format or how old your previous version of Excel"

I have to constantly select the correct color profile at bootup and nothing I've tried seems to fix that. When I do run with the color profile, it's great though, so I give it 3 stars. 5 is the software was good."

48378,1,"Documents to Gp Professional 3.0 is deffinatley the most necessary Palm appliation ever! The fact that it lets you view and edit Microsoft Word and Excel Documents on you handheld is what first cought my attention. At that, I decided to buy it.Though Docuemnts To Go 3.o Professional contains scaled down viewers for Microsoft Excel and Word documents, it provides just enough without taking up tremendous amounts of space on your Palm powered handheld. [It] makes it much more convient than converting all your documents to the Palm document form, and best of all...it retains all formating.Instead of going through the pesky process of converting all my documents whenever I want to put them on my handheld, I can now just copy them to it. And another good feature of this program is that when you Hot Snyc, it automatically updates the files on your handheld is newer versions are available.Now, the reason that I would reccomend buying this product from Amazon is that it is at least ten dollars cheaper than buying it from a local store, shipping included. I made the mistake of buying it from Office Depot and I payed a whopping $79.99.Now whoever you are, if you hae a handheld, this is a program that you MUST have."
9467,0,"As someone who has also played more than my fair share of horse games, I was a bit frustrated and disappointed by this game. For starters, the NICE thing about this game is that it has a more complete manual than most UBISOFT games. However, in keeping with tradition for UBISOFT, on the downside, there are still MAJOR gaps to be filled in - as you can see from other reviewers questions. The sequence of events is not always naturally progressive so there are some areas that you need to make a leap of logic to fill in.There are some areas - such as talking to your horse - which continue to be mysterious no matter how many notes you take. What your horse ""does"" doesn't always match up to the descriptions given. Also, having found something in the manual that didn't match up in game play, I am a bit suspicious that they made sure everything ""written"" had a matching equivalent in game.Additionally, while the level of the game scales up - as in the courses get harder - so too does your level of expected competency. As you get to the last week in the game your expected level of competency is higher than any other week, and the challenges are MUCH harder. As most who have played the game know is near impossible to make any jumping circuit without having at least one refusal(on the cross country course) or at least one bar down (in the show jumping), but during the last week thats exactly what's expected of you. Suffice it to say, with 34 cross country jumps and 15 show jumping jumps, the odds are just that much higher that you won't succeed. I've found myself saving and repeating courses over and over again just so I can try to get the best score possible. You get three fails at any week or task before you're expelled.And as a side note, I am NOT a fan of the ""love interest"" side story, mostly because I find it to be VERY creepy and very disturbing at the end. I just found the concepts to be more mature than should be in a game of this level (E for everyone).Overall the game is entertaining, but frustrating requiring more hours of repetition than actual progressive game time."
85178,1,"If you find yourself in a situation at which you can't or are not allowed to have pets in your house, I recommend this game 100%. It's perfect for others too, especially pet lovers. But especially for YOU, that can't have pets, this game is abosolutely everything that you would have with a real pet.They need attention, they have personalities, they can be trained, they miss you when you're not there, they receive you happily when you open your computer, they bring a lot of responsibility and so much happiness... Don't waste your time on other pet simulators... I've tried 'em all and this one is the one that TOTALLY rocks... (Besides Dogz1, Dogz2 and 4... 3 isn't that good... not recommended.)"
44329,1,"This student edition of Microsoft Office 07 comes with four programs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. Unless you specifically have a need for another Microsoft Office program, this will be more than enough for the average Office user. You've got all the essentials: a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet (Excel), a slide show creator (PowerPoint), and even a nice program to put all your notes (OneNote). Home and Student Office 07 version gives you the basic programs at a cheaper price than the other versions of Office.The main difference you'll find between this 07 version and the Microsoft Office 03 is that all the programs now have the ""ribbon"" instead of being menu-driven. The ribbon is a much more visual representation of all the features you can use. All the different tasks are grouped into ribbons; which are divided up into different tabs you can click on. For example, if you clicked on the ""Insert"" tab in Word you would find tasks such as ""inserting"" a header or ""inserting"" a table. What this means is that instead of being hidden in menus and submenus, most features now can be found simply by being in the right tab. This allows you to find some useful features that you might otherwise not have known existed.Everything from Microsoft 03 is there, it just might take awhile to get used to the new layout of things. There are also a lot of cool new features added in this version, such as easily being able to write complex math equations in Word (it was such a pain in Word 03) and being provided with an easy format to create a bibliography in APA, MLA, Chicago style etc.Perhaps the only drawback of Office 07 is that it's such a drastic change from Office 03 that it will take awhile to get used to. After years of knowing all the complex menus you'll have to learn where everything is all over again, which can be frustrating for vetrans of Office 03. However, if you just give it some time, you'll fall in love with just how well everything is set up and appreciate the new visual style this version implements.Pros:* The new visual style allows easy access to all the various features* You can still save files in Office 97-03 format (Example .doc)Cons:* You must relearn where everything is because of the Ribbon* Not all websites/ programs recognize the new 07 filesFinal Recommendation: Buy it, get used to it, and love it!"
37163,1,I have used this organizer for many years and this purchase was a recent upgrade. It is a great product for those that like to have an organizer that they can bring up on the computer screen. There is an address book included along with a number of other features.
66060,1,this keeps you motivated to do it. After the first week you can unlock items and it makes you want to continue doing it. None of the workouts are the same its great!this really helps. I just wish it had an option to let you take time off. I threw out my back and wasnt able to do the workouts for a while but i didnt want it to count against me
53097,1,"I have been using this terrific software for over a year now. I love it.The program allows me to easily format invitations and envelopes, posters, programs, all sorts of things. The fonts are so beautiful and different, I always get compliments on them. The images and borders are easy to manipulate and alter to make them very unique. In addition, it is very easy to incorporate my own images and manipulate them effortlessly as well.Anything you could possibly want to do, this software makes it easier. I highly recommend it."

I thought this version would be an improvement because it is newer, but I can't stand all the extra time it takes to save invoices, payables and most everything else. However, it still gets the job done, so I can tolerate it until something better comes along."
87636,2,"I remember hearing a lot of good things about this game, but I put it in and it was slow even on a modern computer, I'm not sure if it had to do with installing full install or what. But the story is cool. Missions are a tad bit easy. overall a classic though, defiantly gave star craft a run for its money and that is what was around when this came out."

35430,1,"My five year old just started playing video games and this is a good starter. The game is very forgiving, as SpongeBob never truly dies and my son gets a chance to start over at the last check point. This limits frustration since he doesn't have to start from the beginning every time. There are some areas that require a little adult help, but if one of us is not immediately available, there is enough to do in each area to keep him entertained. He will even jump SpongeBob off a cliff, so he can play the same area over and over."
81705,0,"If you have an old computer or want to use certain old applications - especially DOS-based applications, Windows 98 SE is probably your best bet. If you decide to get Windows 98, be sure to visit windowsupdate.com one of the first things you do, if you plan to go on the internet with the old computer at all. The fixes there should also improve some stability issues with this operating system. Also, be aware that Microsoft is discontinuing support in June 2006 (though forums elsewhere on the net and knowledge base articles will still be available).This operating system also does not have as many drivers for newer hardware built in as do the newer operating systems Windows ME and XP, so you will often need to visit manufacturers sites for drivers or use installation cds that came with your hardware. But if you have mainly older hardware you are using (like a Iomega ditto drive) that would not be as much of an issue. If you don't want to invest the time reading on forums about technical issues occasionally, or are completely new to computers and do not know what DOS is, you would probably be better off with Windows XP if your computer will support it. I myself use Windows 98 SE on my 2nd computer, and XP professional on my main computer. The second computer is too slow (200 mhz) and has too small a hard drive (2 gig) for XP, but runs Office 97 and old DOS games (that are no longer compatible with ME or XP) just fine."
8210,1,"I'm taking my 2nd Photoshop studio course in a college setting in the Commercial Art department right now. I'm an artist who sells her art online. I've quickly discovered that if you ask another student what another design program is like in another CART course offering, the response will be, &quot;Well, it's hard but it's easier than Photoshop.&quot; So far there is NO program I've mentioned in the commercial art department that is not considered easier than Photoshop. That said, it is an absolutely fabulous program and if you are an artist, photographer, designer or work with images in any professional way, then this is the program for you. Conversely, if you are not such a person or, even worse, have minimal computer skills, then I think you'd do better with something simpler, like Paint Shop Pro."
79575,0,"A good upgrade if it weren't for the unforgettable ""printer driver"" bug under Vista.Unless you want to suffer from horribly slow performance, you will need to install a ""default printer"" driver (there are links to more info on this in the Adobe support forums).Why Adobe has not made a patch available for this is hard to understand.Until they do, I cannot give more than three stars to this, otherwise fine, upgrade."
7332,1,"Wasn't certain if I should switch - it's a lot of work to transition everything over to a new system.But, the price breaks that have been out this season enticed me to buy to try it out at the beginning of this year. Well, I've done the work (less than I thought) and the payoff is incredible. The quality of the reports I get with MS is far superior than what I could get from QuickBooks.Wish they had done this years ago. Now all of my systems work very well together, I am finally state of the art with a company that provides great support (Intuit was completely inept at service - they don't get how to run a software support center.)MS knows how to do great product and great support. I'm done with second rate software now that I see what this stuff can do...makes me more in control of my business and even gives me ideas on how I can look at the business in different ways."
1206,1,This product is awesome. Since I installed it there have been NO sperious advertisements Period
86343,1,I am a beginner in French and I am so happy I found this program. It's easy. There is absolutely no memorization and finally no homework. I have seen the Rosetta Stone program at a friend's house and in my opinion it's just not as good. SmartFrench offers a real approach and allows you to experience the language the way it is really spoken. They make you work on random conversations by French people. People talk about themselves or their work and it's fun. It's entertaining and efficient. The program is easy to use and I am learning very fast. I feel that I am learning much more than just words or sentences. I like the fact that on the same CD-Rom there are three levels from Beginner to Advanced. I definitely give 5 stars to this program.

This purchase was a waste of time and money both. The interface was cluncky and difficult to use. Switching areas requires switching between 6 different disks. There limited symbols that can be placed on the map.

42653,0,"I do not do well with anything about a computer that is not real straight forward. I have not been happy with the word program. I go to close a document and it makes me close it twice and the word program from 2003 did not make me do that. I do not want to spend time calling customer support so I just downloaded open source and use their word similar program and it is just fine. I am sure it is something that would take all of two seconds to fix but I don't like feeling helpless when I expect it to just be right to begin with. They sell a million of these, right? Also, it bugs me that I can't convert Microsoft Works documents into word. They are the same company for crying out loud. Anyway, my wife insisted I get her excel program back after I deleted it when we got a new computer and this was a very reasonable price to make my peace with her. It's probably pretty good for the money."
72023,1,"Every Product has its own quirks. But Peachtree is the best of its kind out there in the market. There might be some cosmetic shortcomings, but for one who is buying it really to use its core functionality, a few minor one time adjustments is a no effort thing.Peachtree is the software that sells the most, even at this price. People do not buy it just for the heck of it. It's the core that matters, not the face."
52276,2,"I cannot express enough how absolutely terrible this program is.First, let me say that I have been an avid Quicken user since 1994. At that time, I was balancing my checkbook by hand and Quicken was a lifesaver. At first I used it to print out checks and balance my checkbook electronically. But, as technology quickly grew, I began to use Quicken to pay bills electronically, track my investments online, categorize my expenses, and track my net worth. Upgrades were offered at a discount to existing users, and they incorporated straightforward, necessary changes which enhanced the program's usefulness. Life was good.Then, somewhere around 2000, Quicken started to fall apart. In an obvious attempt to make more money, they stopped offering discounted upgrades to existing users. In addition, program changes were, by-and-large, becoming unecessary. So, in order to justify selling a new program each year, they kept needlessly overhauling the interface from one version to the next. So each time you upgraded, you had to re-learn everything. And if you stuck with your current version, as I tried to do, you could not fully utilize the online features because they were no longer supported. So you were forced to upgrade - at full price - to whatever Intuit wanted to throw your way.I am happy to annouce that, with Quicken 2003 Deluxe, I have just purchased my last and final upgrade. I am sad, however, to announce that Intuit has finally gone over the edge. First of all, the interface is ridiculous. It's so confusing that you simply cannot perform even the simplest tasks without going through a myriad of confusing pop-up screens and menus. Nothing is Intuitive (ironically) and almost nothing comes without errors, advertisements, or problems. For example, I have several fairly straightforward securities through a 401K account. But for some reason, the price per share for some of the securities kept coming up as zero - and I was unable to update the prices, either manually or online. This was an obvious bug in the program that cost me many hours of frustration with no resolution. Again, let me express that I am an advanced user and I am very certain that this is a programming bug. Of course, the only free technical support that Intuit now offers is a weak online database which resolved none of my problems. If you want to talk to a live person, you have to pay for both the call and the service. Incredible.But the problems don't end there. I'll spare you the long story of how I wasn't able to register the program because of a bug in the included browser - so I couldn't use any of the online features without getting annoying pop-up reminders to register the program - even though the program wouldn't allow me to register it! I won't tell you about how the program kept re-booting my system because of browser conflicts with Internet Explorer. And I certainly won't relay the long and tiring story about how my unlock code - which I had legitimately paid for - failed to work upon re-installing the program from factory purchased discs. Their solution to this problem was to call an 800 number, which, when called, gives you a message that the number is no longer supported. Incredible.So, after all of that, I went and bought Microsoft Money 2003 - regardless of what I had just spent on Quicken. I'm happy to report that the installation was easy, the set-up was flawless, and there is not a bug to be found. In addition, there are no advertisements, there is plenty of support, and the interface is absoutely intuitive. I was up and running in less than 2 hours with all of the capabilities of Quicken and then some.In summary, Quicken has completely lost the plot. They began in 1994 by making my life easier, and ended up in 2003 making it considerably more difficult. If they keep up like this, they do not deserve to remain in business. So, Quicken users, take my advice, don't be afraid, and switch to Microsoft Money today. You'll be very glad you did."

I see really no meaningful difference between the two.Personnaly I will stick with and recommend taxcut for 3 reasons1) Does not have a history of installing stupid additional software with it.2) has all the features of turbo tax for the average user(if you are running a buisiness and have a tax consultant go with turbo tax)3) it is cheaper.If you want additional support of have alot of capital gains from stocks get the premium version."
86444,1,"If you're shooting with a Nikon especially with raw (NEF) files, then this software is a must have. I find I do 90% of my post processing in Capture NX. If I have to perform any touch ups or more dramatic effects, then I save first in NX and open in either Paint Shop Pro or Photoshop Elements.I definitely recommend shooting raw and using Capture NX for the sheer flexibility. With raw, you're able to adjust white balance, sharpening, exposure compensation, color mode and a host of other things. This software is also good for JPEG formatted images. However, it you lose the flexibility.In terms of ease of use, I give Capture NX 9 out of 10. The interface is simple and intuitive once you grasp the concept of a work flow. You can even create a list of changes and save those settings for use on other images. Furthermore, you can use the settings you saved and run it on several files as a batch process. This is extremely useful for sets of pictures you shot with the same lighting, exposure, etc."
18302,0,"Our IT group as well as another company's IT group has spent too much time trying to get this to work.I have been trying to help the individuals who are using this software and during my research and trials, I came across a FREE standards-based software Apple develops called Xmeeting. It's only for Macs, but if you have a Mac or can get one for this purpose, it may be well worth the hassle of dealing with Polycom or other VTC products who are not savvy with firewalls.The Xmeeting program ([...]) has a built-in software-based firewall transversal feature (using STUN). The video conference worked flawlessly the first time without any changes to the NAT (firewall) settings.Other solutions, like Polycom, should be this ""intelligent"". Kudos to Apple for providing a FREE solution!"
35219,1,"In this game, you are a submarine sort of thing. You get to navigate your way through the ocean reefs to find little message capsules that will eventually lead you to a ship that needs assistance (?). I have never finished the game, but then again, it takes a long time. It's lots of fun, though. You have an air supply, and every time you hit a fish, or something shooting from a fish, or certain plants and parts of the 'walls', then you loose air. You get air at the beginning of every level, and you can get extra if you touch a dolphin with an air pack on its back. Every once and a while you will have to answer a question, most (all?) of the time involving math. If you get it wrong, you loose air. Also, you have ink balls to throw at fish and plants that with keep them away from you while you go past. As the levels progress, it's harder to navigate to get all the capsules, the math questions are harder, and there are more difficult fish you have to get by.So it's not a character or adventure game, it's a learning game, but it's fun. I can't really say the age level of the game, considering everyone is different, but I'd say between 11-14 years of age this game is best for.(p.s. I was 14 years old when I wrote this review. I enjoyed it for years!)"

30512,1,"""The Amazing Spider-Man Complete Comic Book Collection"" is a necessary part of any true ""Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book collector's collection. The only thing that is better then this collection is having the original books themselves. The Scans are complete books from cover to cover, ads, and pinups.The scans look good at 800% zoon, but I find that 200% makes for an easy and clear reading of the scans. It is wonderful to be able to view the scans from any computer and prints them to read from other locations. The prints look equally as good as the scans.I would recommend the ""The Amazing Spider-Man Complete Comic Book Collection"" to any true Amazing Spider-Man collector, who wants to see 43 years of the amazing stories, of Marvel's most amazing character, the one the only Amazing Spider-Man."

I have a Dell Precision M70 (top of the line) and I wouldn't expect many comflicts. It interupts me every time at startup and my daughter, who is very computer savvy, has also expressed frustration with this. I'm sticking with it to see how it works over the coming months. My suggestion to others is to have a look at Trend Micro's PC-cillan. I installed it on my wife's computer and several computers at work, including my own. So far I like it better; my only complaint/comment would be that people remember, if they are having problems connecting anything over a network, to temporarily turn off the firewall."
75096,0,"For those of us using the Intel Mac platform, CS3 is a long awaited program. Now that we have it, let no one tell you Photoshop isn't the most difficult program you will ever use. Photoshop is probably the most documented program out there in terms of ""learning and using"" tools, texts and tutorial sites. If you're new to Photoshop, get ready to get your hands really dirty and your mind in a real state of, ""something."" Join the thousands of users who need help!I come to Photoshop CS3 having used several versions of Elements over the past many years. In this respect, I am quite fortunate that I am not starting from scratch. But CS3 is a whole new world. Adobe Photoshop CS3 Classroom in a Book is probably a good starting point for many. The key to the book is the included CD which contains everything you'll need to work through the detailed lessons. And believe me, the lessons scratch everything you'll need to understand what you've gotten yourself into with Photoshop.Initially, I tried to use the book and CD as a ""resource"" building on what I knew from using Elements. This really doesn't work because the book isn't constructed that way. You just have to grit your teeth and ""follow along and do"" what's going on in the book using the included images, etc. Although you can use your own images to do the extensive lessons, I wouldn't recommend that approach. The included images are designed, first and foremost, to allow you to do what's being done in the lessons. If you attempt to use your own images ( and I did ) you set yourself up for frustration. While the particular tool or process you are learning will eventually be carried over to your own work, your image may not be as easy to use because of tonal differences or backgrounds which may ""confuse"" the tool you are using. Just bite the bullet and ""do it by the book!""Although the book appears to target new users, experienced Photoshop gurus can learn particularly when it comes to the many new tools and features in CS3. What's my overall opinion? On balance, this is not the best book for me. I have just enough knowledge to be dangerous! I prefer to learn by doing -- right or wrong. I prefer to ""try this and that"" although this method can be frustrating. I also prefer to learn by using specific tutorials designed to do what I am trying to accomplish. I beat the seemingly endless video and written tutorials available to NAPP members ( you probably better join! ) until they are worn out. Depending on your knowledge level and learning style, this book may be either ""perfect"" or ""something else."" I am neutral on the book. What I am really waiting for is Scott Kelby's forthcoming book on CS3 because, if his history is any guide, it will be a super learning tool."

31252,0,"When I first played Carmen Sandiego: Word Detective a few years ago, I just knew I had to have the whole Carmen CD-ROM collection. I had collected every single one of the CD-ROMs when I laid my eyes on Think Quick here on Amazon. I searched far and low for Think Quick, and I knew I couldn't order over the Internet, but I just thought I'd never find it and gave up. Then, when I came across it at a TJ-MAXX, I couldn't believe my luck! The ride home from the store seemed like forever since I wanted to just run in and plug it into the computer as fast as possible!Sure enough, the game was and still is fun. Carmen has stolen a ton of knowledge from the world in subjects such as English (Grammar), Science, and Mathematics and stored it in these activated robots called bots. Your mission? Well, first sign in at the Acme Academy by picking your level: easy, medium, or hard. Then, you get to pick two counties to go to. Once you get to those two countries, you have to play a mini-game and catch the bot, and then they ask you questions from the subject they specialize in.The more questions you answer, the more points you get. After you finally answer the questions in your mission, you go to a villain's hideout to crack a code to capture the villain and retrieve stolen knowledge. Warning! Sometimes the code can be tricky, and if you miss it, you have to forcefully invade the hideout and the villain will get away. My problem is: I have racked up a good amount of points, solved a large number of cases, and cracked a reasonable amount of codes, but each time, I never reach THE CONCLUSION.I mean, I had completed mission after mission for half a year and no big finale characteristic of a Carmen game happened. Does anybody know what to do and what happens? If so, write a review above mine and tell me what happens. That being said, Carmen Sandiego: Think Quick Challenge is an extremely fun and entertaining super-spy adventure. Carmen fans everywhere won't be disappointed!"
53307,0,"I got this software on sale for $35, but even for full price it offers a lot. However, while it is useful for getting a good overview of an area, for planning a backcountry trip, or perhaps even for on-trail hiking, I would not rely on this software for serious off-trail navigation. It simply does not have the detail or accuracy of USGS 7.5' quads. While reasonably good at representing mountain terrain (though not without problems), for some reason the software has real trouble with the canyon country of the Colorado Plateau. Streams are regularly shown flowing 50' or more up canyon walls before returning to what should be the watercourse, and the bottoms of canyons are frequently shown filled with a series of strange depressions or sinks down into and back up out of which streams supposedly flow. Dirt roads are occasionally shown scaling cliffs or dropping off of them into canyons. Even in mountain terrain, streams are sometimes shown flowing uphill, while lakes all too often seem to climb part way up the slopes of the basins that contain them.In addition, several landscape features I am quite familiar with are misnamed and/or incorrectly located (e.g. Surprise Valley in Canyonlands National Park is called ""Sunrise Valley,"" Hovenweep National Monument mysteriously shows up inside Mesa Verde National Park when it is in fact some 80 miles to the west, two of the three natural bridges in Natural Bridges National Monument are shown in the wrong canyon and/or many hundreds of yards from their actual locations). Routes I have hiked in the past, which I found with the help of USGS 7.5' quads, are impossible to discern from the lower level of detail offered by this software.At $35 or even $50 for pretty decent topo coverage of the entire Western US, these are not huge drawbacks, but you should be clear about what you are and aren't getting for your money. It's a fun program to use for planning trips from home, but I very much doubt that I'll ever print maps with it for use in the field. For that, I'll still order my maps from Mytopo.com, which allows you to create your own custom topos (on waterproof paper) made from USGS 7.5' quads. If I had limitless funds, I might buy the National Geographic topo software, which uses real USGS 7.5' quads, but at $99 per state it would cost well over $1000 to get the same coverage as the Topo USA Western Region package. At any rate, for what I paid, I'm fairly pleased with this software, limitations and all."

When the need did arise, I installed an old 56k modem I had laying around and activated the XP faxing utility to receive. Works fine and distinguishes between voice and fax. I find out that the XP fax utility won't handle attachments, and suddenly I have a need to fax a receipt. Fine. I find a cheap version of WF Pro on an auction site so now I can handle anything that comes my way. Right?Not really. If you set it to automatic receive, all your callers will hear that annoying fax ring. If you disable automatic receive, you'll need to be in front of your computer to receive a fax! &lt;sarcasm>That's a great use of my time.&lt;/sarcasm> Back to the dark ages. The only solution Symantec offers for this problem is to pay for distinctive ring with your phone company - and that only works with Windows 95 and 98! If the cheap-y little built-in utility can do it, WFP should be able to do it!Summary: This is an antiquated, bloated program. It installs a ton of unneeded garbage - and then won't even distinguish between voice and fax incoming calls. Although better than WXP's built in faxing utility, not worth buying unless you have a lot of time on your hands or a computer dedicated to it."
62000,1,"I used I Hate Spam! for a year and was quite satisfied with it, and it's a very good spam filter program. I wrote a very positive review some months ago for it, and it has certainly served me well. It was easy to configure and although I was only using it with Outlook Express, which doesn't have all the filter options compared to Outlook, it was still able to catch about 80% of the spam. I had also researched the other spam filter programs before buying this one, and it had very good reviews on Amazon, compared to McAfee's Spamkiller, which I'd already bought, but hadn't opened yet. So I returned it and exchanged it for I Hate Spam!One nice feature of the program is it allows you to ""bounce"" unwanted emails back to their source. This sends a return email that looks like its from the main email router that your address is invalid, which hopefully causes it to be removed from the spammer's mailing list sometimes. I don't know how effective this really is, but they're a certain amount of satisfaction in bouncing their message back to them and clogging up their mailbox with unwanted messages too.My only problem with it is that since I only have 128 megs of RAM with XP, after some months the spam filters got so large my email ran quite slow and my hard disk started thrashing a lot. I was surprised the combination of Outlook and I Hate Spam! had gotten that memory intensive, but the spam filters update regularly from the web, and after a while the filter database gets quite big, and every email gets compared against it, which takes some time.Anyway, over the last several years my spam load has probably increased 10 times, to the point where I'm getting 10 times as much spam as actual email. That plus the memory issues I was experiencing meant my email downloads were taking a long time even though I only get 2-3 emails a day, and I was getting 20-30 spam messages. That's not much compared to several people I know who get 100 spam emails a day, but still, I finally decided to bite the bullet and change my email account name. You can usually do this through the webmail interface for your ISP. Mine is Earthlink, so I went to their Account Maintenance page, selected eMail, and went through the steps to change my email address. Now I get zero spam and no more viruses either, which were getting more and more frequent, since I'd gotten on probably dozens of spammer mailing lists. Recently I got on the ones for Viagra and was getting lots of those. Then I started getting the ones for penis enlargement products, which I suppose was only inevitable after getting on the Viagra lists. Oh well, that's modern life for you.Anyway, it was at that point that I decided to change my email name. For some people this isn't practical for professional reasons or business reasons, but I'm retired so although I have about 100 correspondents, it's no big deal. I sent out a message to my entire distribution list that my email name was changing after four or five years, and to make a note of it. Of course, 3/4 of those people won't do that and will fail to put the new name in their address book, but oh well. Anyway, I recommend you do this too if you possibly can. At this point I don't even need I Hate Spam!, but I still run it anyway since it's so much faster now.One last word of caution. I got all that spam because when I first got online about 5 years ago I not too wisely signed up at various webpages for various online information services such as electronic magazines, or information updates on various subjects I was interested in, and other free stuff, and after awhile, everybody and anybody had my email address. So be careful what you sign up for. Otherwise you'll have more email than you know what to do with.Another way this happens is if someone you know gets one of those Outlook email viruses that sends emails out to everybody in your address book. Now you'll be getting emails forever with that virus in it since you'll be on the list of people to email. This is one reason why it's important to have an anti-virus program too in addition to a spamkiller.Overall, a fine program, although if you take my recommendation to change your email name, you probably won't need a spam filter. :-)"

I am a physician/researcher and write and give presentations extensively. For me, clear and efficient presentation of content is most important.

I create PDF files using Adobe Acrobat. My wife is a first grade teacher and uses StarOffice exclusively. I also use StarOffice to create and edit complex web tables for my web pages. It comes with a good relational database, Adabas, that is ODBC compliant. Major criticisms: StarOffice needs a better bibliography package (this can be an big issue if you need to submit manuscripts for publication), and the equation formula editor was so-so (LaTeX is still the best here)."

I often use the included Nero ShowTime 3 to watch DVD, VCD and Divx/Xvid videos - just one codec to handle all MPEG-1/2/4 streams. The main program Nero Burning Rom is very stable and so far I don't have a problem with it (far better than the unstable Roxio software). Nero's 'InCD' makes a CD-RW/DVD-RW like a big removable drive.

The InCD instance for the first user still works though."
35690,1,"So I just finished all of the lessons in the software. That alone should give this product a couple of stars....I have previously tried many different ways to learn Chinese (books, CDs etc), but each time, I have given up within 3 weeks.This product really kept me motivated, because it helped me retain the material! As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a ton of exercises to drill the new vocabulary in, which is so helpful. As background, I am a person who has a really tough time retaining languages....I took 5yrs of French back in High School, but the material just went in one ear and out the other. So the fact that I retained so much due to this product speaks volumes about its effectiveness.I attempted each lesson twice....one time, I'd take the full lesson, trying all of the exercises, and typing out all of the answers. The 2nd time, I'd skip some of the questions which I knew well. Now that I am done, I plan on trying all the lessons one more time, just to become a little quicker at translating the spoken Chinese (there are 2 really nice lessons at the end which have long sections of dialogue....its a good way to test how much you have progressed).So what have I learned? My wife, who is Chinese born and speaks fluent Mandarin can understand most of the phrases that I say now, which is nice. I haven't learned enough to carry out a 1min + conversation with her yet, but that's to be expected, since this product is an introduction to Mandarin. I can basically just ask her a few random questions. I'll need to move on to a different product now to further my education. If you just want to be able to survive in China on a short vacation, you should be okay (eg you do learn how to order at a restaurant, give instructions to a cab driver, etc).PROS (keeping this short, because many other pros mentioned in other reviews)-As I stated above, this product really works. I am pleasantly surprised with my progress.....not to mention the fact that it kept me motivated to stick with it all the way to the end.-There are several exercises that concentrate on pronunciation. The exercises where you tape yourself speaking are especially useful.-The podcasts are great! Hopefully they are making more of them. It was a great idea to combine the guy who was just learning Mandarin, with the expert. His mistakes combined with her tips were so helpful (IMO this section is more helpful that the tips given by the main instructor in the software piece).-There are 2 exercises which are devoted to tones. These are probably two of the most useful. As you may know, Mandarin is heavily dependent on tones. These exercises say several different words, and you need to figure out which tone is being used. I found this extremely difficult in some cases (maybe its just me?).-As you progress further into the product, you are tested on words that you learned a couple of sessions back. It's a good way to keep everything fresh.-The customer service is great. They answered my emails within the hour.CONS-Here's why I didn't give this product 5 stars: the lessons Vs cost. For the price I paid, I would have liked a few more lessons (maybe 10 or so more). I guess I would be satisfied with more podcasts instead. Alternatively, given the current number of lessons, I think a price approx $100 cheaper would be more fair. I guess this product is still priced cheaper than Rosetta, so I can't complain too much.-At the start of each lesson, Sonia takes us through the passage, and gives some comments. While I did like the concept of having an instructor taking us through the dialogue, I do have some complaints about this section. First, and most important, Sonia's pronunciation is not great (as my Mandarin speaking wife pointed out... she actually started laughing when she heard Sonia's words in a number of cases). I don't know why they just didn't get someone who speaks both Chinese and English fluently to teach this (there are many people who could do this, for example the girl in the podcasts). That said, the exercises are spoken by someone else, and therefore have the correct pronunciation. Also, I didn't really think the comments offered by Sonia about her experiences added that much value at all (although her trick to remember the word for restaurant was nice).-In the exercises where you need to type in the pinyin, and there are multiple ways of saying things which have been taught, the software only accepts the 1 answer. This can get frustrating when you think you have made a mistake, but indeed you are correct. Fortunately, I had someone to ask when I was unsure. But it would have been nice if they programmed 2-3 answers, particularly because they taught 2-3 options in those cases.-When you get an answer incorrect, and you press on the answer button, your original response disappears. Sometimes it becomes difficult to remember where you made the error (particularly when your mistake was to use the wrong tone), because you have nothing available to compare to the correct answer."
53422,0,"My VoiceI have bought this product over two years. In general, the product idea is excellent, but the implementation restricts its usability.How I use it? I basically enjoy singing with our friends. This product allows us to sing together in a karaoke like fashion. We pick the song we like and add lyrics to the songs, open my voice application, project the lyrics to a big screen and sing. So much fun.On the plus side:1. Allow you to create lyrics easily.2. Sing songs with lyrics full screen in Karaoke style.3. Sing with voice and no voice.My friends are impressed in our gathering. However, on the ""lack"" side when we use the software:1. No play list. Each person needs to have their own favorite play lists with customizable settings.2. The singing list cannot be ordered manually. I have to rename the song title with '1', '2'.. to order it. So while singing, we don't have to search for the song.3. When sing in full screen mode, could not repeat the same song or go back to last one without leaving the screen lyrics mode.4. The lyrics are in program storage, make it very hard to back up the lyrics.5. Need personally customizable backdrop for the same song. Like when A sing a song, it could select picture X, while B could select picture Y for the same song.6. Need songs search capability. If we have over 100 songs, browsing to find a song is a big problem.With the above improvement, I'll give this product a 5 stars. I am surprised that IPE is still updating the software (my original version is 1.52) but not any of those mentioned above. Because of this limitations, I am reluctant to recommend to our friends to use it. I hope that these easy implementation will be in the coming updates and I could give it a 5 stars."

Amazing. Spotlight is cool but still need to play with it more. Mac Mail runs smoother, too. The RSS features to Web sites is integrated into Safari, which seems many times faster than the previous version. One notable problem I had was trying to install to the ""upgrade."" As with a previous review, I found it better just to back everything up and start fresh. Wipe the hard drive clean! You'll have to re-install everything but it does seem to run faster. And don't expect your old iPhoto program to be included into 10.4. Apple has redesiged the photo program to 5.0 and has included it into their iLife software. So, back up those old photos.This operating system is by far faster and smoother than Panther. It's worth the money to upgrade."
93512,1,"The guys at Symantec finally got their act together and got it right! Beside the slow install, everything else is great. Personally I don't really care for the install speed, since it's a one time hit. Comprehensive protection and peace of mind is something I value more, everything else are simply minor trade offs.I like the new UI enhancements, it feels much faster than the previous version I had on the system. The best part is the Spyware scanner. It didn't take up the UI with junky detections that didn't pose real threats to the system, but only things that mattered. I tried installing on a teenager's machine, and it picked up a lot of stuff. Once the machine is clean, their real protections Auto protect and Firewall suite took care of everything else. You just have spend a few seconds reading the alerts when it tries to tell you something. Usually the information helps me make the right decisions on what to do. I actually find the alerts somewhat educational.NIS 2006 is not cheap, but cheap considering how much time I have saved. Two thumbs up for a product I can trust."

31049,1,"I find it constraining to use just one English dictionary, especially since leaving several software dictionaries open eases their concurrent use, So I review the three that I typically use, though there are more--and good ones--out there. Although I just go to the most user-friendly one (RHWUD) for most quick consultations, I sometimes find it necessary to probe two of them, and even all three. When I want to know more about the etymology or the different meanings of a difficult word, each one may add a little something that the others don't have. Consulting all three often leads to a better grasp of the word. This may sound eccentric or wasteful to some, but it will make sense to lots of people.I use:The Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, version 3.0 for 32-bit Windows (RHWUD)The Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary, version 3.0 (MWCD)The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 5th ed. on CD-ROM, version 2.0 (SOED)In addition to phonological symbols, all three dictionaries can use the computer's audio facility to pronounce clearly. All three provide etymologies and a word's entry date in the English language. All three dictionaries are for MS Windows. I don't know whether they have Mac or other OS versions. After fully installing them on the computer's hard disk, they can be used without their CD-ROM.The software version of RHWUD is light and loads faster than the others do. It covers more proper names. Although all three dictionaries are very easy to use, RHWUD is the easiest one. As you type each letter of a word in a small box, a left panel below the box shows words progressively closer to what you are typing. After you finish typing the word, the left panel shows words coming before and after the typed word, so you can quickly spot its variants and all adjacent words, variant or not. Clicking on a word in the left panel produces the details on that word in the right panel.The software version of the Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary (MWCD) also has two panels, but the left panel does not show any progressive list as you type each letter of a word. You finish typing the word, then you have to press ENTER or click on a Search button in other to see the results. (In contrast, RHWUD may land on the word even before you finish typing it.) If you typed the word correctly, then you'll see a left panel with some close-spelling variants that are RELATED to the word, NOT all the strictly adjacent words like in RHWUD. If you type something that is not in the dictionary, you will get nothing but a small window stating the word does not exist. If the mistake was inadvertent, you'll be more careful and you'll get your result. But if you were just guessing the spelling, then your are in the dark. You'll have to keep guessing with alternative spellings. In such a situation, the RHWUD would have shown you exactly at what letter the mistake began. And the left panel might have provided the clues to the correct spelling because of its ""adjacents"". This is mostly why the RHWUD is more user-friendly. However, I feel the MW may be a bit more authoritative. Its definitions tend to be successfully concise, which make them seem a tiny bit more accurate. Otherwise, for the majority of words, both are practically equivalent.The MW lets you access a dedicated thesaurus, with synonyms, antonyms, and related words more systematically available than in the dictionary module. Not all words can be found in the thesaurus, of course, but, when they are there, the MWCD is a net plus for choosing more carefully among similar words. (My preferred software thesaurus, however, is the New Oxford Thesaurus of English in the multi-dictionary ""iFinger"" format. I may review it one day, if I can remember it at the right spare time.)For special words, both dictionaries compare quasi-synonyms at the bottom of the right panel; an easy way to get, in one spot, the fine nuances between roughly similar words.BTW, the ""Webster"" name has proliferated in the naming of American dictionaries. The history of the name in the business can be easily found on the Internet. (Wikipedia?)For those who want to probe further into words, there is the expansive and expensive Oxford English Dictionary (OED). A compromise is its shorter version, the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (SOED). But even the SOED is a step up from the RHWUD and MWC--for COMMON names only. It does not generally do proper names. For instance, London and Paris are there, but Madrid and Churchill are not). In a way, its dating of words is vaguer than the other two: for example, E20 (early 20th century) instead of 1917. But it can date each meaning of a word, something the others don't do. Its user-friendliness is almost equal to the MWCD's. The others will get you to ""vague"" if you type ""vaguer"". The SOED will yield nothing; you won't even see ""vaguer"" in the entry for ""vague"". You won't find ""smaller"" directly, or even after you get the ""small"" entry (except for a single instance in an example, at the bottom of the entry. This neglect of the comparative (and superlative) may be excused under the assumption that sophisticated users already know the comparative and superlative forms of regular adjectives, but I prefer thoroughness. That said, SOED often gives more details, more subtleties, and more examples than the other two, and sometimes in ways that really matter (example below). Well worth it despite its higher price tag. The spelling is British. It will respond to American spelling and identify it as American, but it will send you to the entry of the corresponding British spelling. Vice versa for the two other dictionaries: they are American, but they recognize British spellings and identify them as such (they usually cover differences in meaning, too, when such a difference exists).Three simple illustrations of why it's useful to have several dictionaries available.First, the verb ACCRUE. In my view, MWCD 11th edition gives a better definition than RHWUD:1. More senses than RHWUD2. Many examples for the different senses, whereas RHWUD gives none (but sometimes it's the other way around)3. Both the intransitive and transitive uses of the verb in MWCD, while RHWUD only gives the intransitive uses.On the other hand, RHWUD has plenty of synonyms and antonyms for ACCRUE, which MWCD does not provide at all--EVEN in its thesaurus module, because its thesaurus has no entry for ""accrue""!MWCD's treatment of ""accrue"" is as good, if not better than SOED's: the former offers an example for each meaning of ""accrue"", the latter none (though SOED usually comes up with examples). But SOED uniquely dates EACH of the four senses of the word.But don't get me wrong: ""accrue"" is not representative of the general performance of each dictionary; just an illustration that some entries are richer here in one case and richer there in another case. For many words, the difference is either inexistent or not worth mentioning.Second illustration: DIONYSIAN. SOED has important meanings for that adjective that are not even touched upon by the two other dictionaries. It's one of those situations where the SOED can really shine above the others.Third illustration: MALTHUS. Besides specifying Malthus's life span, MWCD limits itself to identify Malthus as an economist. RHWUD adds that he was also a clergyman, a snall but rather important addition. SOED does not typically cover proper names, so Malthus is not to be found as an entry (although, given the widely known pronoucements of Malthus, Malthusian has made it as an adjective and is therefore in the SOED). The other two cover ""Malthusian"", of course.So, good dictionaries are not equal, despite massive overlaps. If you only want one dictionary, there is a good case for the SOED, especially if you don't care about proper nouns. If you insist on ease of use or a larger pool of proper names, the RHWUD is probably better. MWCD is a solid choice that I would not want to be without, because I have a long experience of its competence. It also has plenty of proper names, but I suspect less than in RHWUD, especially for lesser known people and places."
25610,2,"I bought Norton AntiVirus because I had nothing but problems with McAfee. Well when I first installed Norton, everything seemed fine, that is until I tried to connect to the internet. For some reason this program kept blocking my internet connection, so I had to disable Norton in order to get online. Then I went to there so called user support web site, which is a total joke. They don't even have a place where you can e-mail them your questions, so you have to sort through a bunch of stuff just to find the answer to your problem. Then when Norton tries to update it claims that it can't find my internet connection, and then other times it will work just fine. I kept getting error messages with the subscription, and had to re-install this program several times. I don't know why McAfee and Norton can't make better programs that are hassle free, all I have to say is that I hope that they get their acts together because this is ridiculous. I buy these programs and I expect to get my money's worth, unfortunatley I don't think these companies care one way or another."
12693,1,"The operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer. But, obviously, if you want a computer with more security features or networking features, you should go with Windows XP Professional. At the time that I am writing this, which is a long time from when I purchased Windows XP, it is a time where Windows Vista is emerging. If you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer, I recommend Windows XP Home/Professional (based on your requirements). But if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast, try Windows Vista. But one word of warning about Vista, the User Account Control (UAC) is a pain in the butt."

35579,1,This runs far smoother than 1.0 and the updates. The browsing on my macbook pro feels more like it does for iphoto making the experience much more pleasurable. If you're an amatuer just stick to iphoto though for the most part the only thing i can think of that feels better with aperture 2.0 are the workflows and the presentation of work. All in all it's not much of an upgrade except performance improvements.

I downloaded the 15-day trial version and after spending a mere few minutes to create my label, decided to purchase the Deluxe version. This is a software I didn't mind spending the money for. It's extremely user-friendly and very easy to create labels if you're a novice or an advanced user. I loved the templates and the background options. I am looking forward to creating my next label. In fact, because of it's so easy to use, I will be making CDs just because.... This is a must have for any and everyone."
12984,1,"The download update kept giving me an error message after it hung at 68% for a minute. I thought it was because the server was too 'busy', but then I tried it at 4 AM- same error message. I later found that it was actually my routers fault- there's a MTU setting that needs to be set (mine is now set to 192 and set to active, you need to 'log on' to your router to set this). After I set it, I had no problems with downloading the update and finishing the return. (I'm running Windows XP on a modern Dell PC).Overall, the program is easy to use, but I would still recommend at least going over the entire return by hand. Since it's not the Premier version, it may omit the opportunity for you to include items that will save you money, such business expenses, for example. And if your return is complicated, it's likely you'd be better off with an accountant or professional tax preparation service."

Any one who is considering buying this game, I say to go for it. It is totally worth your money. But...I did see a few minor problems. First of all, the screen kept on going black, and I kept having to move the cursor around to restore the picture. Also, there was a dialogue error too, when I read a word in the dialogue box, but the character was saying something else. But, I still like the CD, and the people at HerInteractive did a really good job! I actually wouldn't be surprised if boys started playing! I just don't think this one will be my favorite game. But keep up the good work HerInteractive!"
3916,1,"All of the great things about Linux in general: stability, security, and the incredible array of productivity tools, have made it into Red Hat Linux 8.0 all wrapped up in a slick new look and easy to use interface. Unfortunately, the bad things about Linux: instability of the [somewhat more obscure] programs, poor, Windows-like security out of the box, and the mind-numbingly huge array of tools, came along with it as well.Red Hat 8.0 looks beautiful. It comes with a couple of great things for the average home user or general-work desk jockey. First off, there's Open Office 1.0.1. This is a slick, easy to use, and incredibly versatile and powerful office suite that, frankly, matches or rivals Microsoft's competing Office suite in every worthwhile category (yes - a lot of the pointless junk in MS Office that you didn't use made it to Open Office, but not all of it). It includes a Word Processor, a Spreadsheet, Math tools, and a Powerpoint-ish program that I haven't used yet. All of them work wonderfully and I've yet to have a problem with this latest version of Open Office.Next, there's Ximian Evolution. INCREDIBLE. That's all that needs said. If you like the idea of all of the worthwhile functionality of Outlook without the instability and insecurity (and a lot of the glut), you'll LOVE Evolution. You can even hook up to an Exchange server by purchasing the necessary software seperately (at a VERY reasonable price as of the time of this writing).However, there are down sides. Red Hat 8.0, like many other Linux distributions, comes with an absolutely mind-boggling array of packages that can be installed. Unfortunately, to this date, I have been unable to keep an installation under 800 MB. Many of the packages that are available or get installed are nothing more than duplicated work that other packages already provide. Also, the massive installation requires you to diligently track down and shut down services to improve on the security of the system.Still, that's more than other OSes provide (Microsoft Windows), and it's far cheaper. A lot of functionality, a lot of potential, but honestly, if you want a server, get FreeBSD or OpenBSD. However, since this is the personal edition, I would whole-heartedly reccomend it to anyone looking to replace their stale, unusable Windows systems on a home computer. Thumbs up Red Hat!"

55980,0,"I agree with some of the reviewers on here: this game is BORING. All you do is walk around the island doing pointless stuff that doesn't help you get farther in the game. And there are annoying lego people who keep getting in your way, talking to you and dismantling themselves. There is a bug(at least with us): When you build a vehicle, you have to click in the EXACT right spot to pick up a piece. And the dumb annoying lego guy ALWAYS gets in your way when you're trying to click on the right spot.To ""win"" the game, you have to on purpose set the Brickster loose, than catch him again, then everyone calls you a ""hero"". There are no challenging things to do. What a pointless idea.The graphics are okay, but there was this on time when the street was colored like the ocean and the grass was colored like the street. Lego Island 2 is MUCH better."

26267,1,"Installed this Windows XP SP2 Upgrade of Windows Millennium on a 10 year-old Gateway Professional, which worked with only a couple of hitches. After removing most of my files, the upgrade went fairly well with 128MB of RAM. After the upgraded operating system was working, I added RAM to 512MB and changed out the CDROM drive for a DVD/CD RW drive, with XP SP2 recognizing both changes immediately. After reading some reported experiences on the internet, I was a bit aprehensive; but the instructions on Microsoft's web site were very specific and better written than those in the package. Finding the ME product key proved elusive; but somehow the software found a key that permitted the installation of the upgrade. I like XP SP2 very much and have now downloaded SP3 to the computer. NO BLUE WINDOWS for several weeks now, so it was worth all the effort and aprehensiveness."
47151,0,"The Eye-One LT can become an Eye-One Display 2 through a firmware update which then unlocks additional software features. The firmware update costs around double the price difference between the LT and the Display 2. If you are a casual user wanting to go cheap, the Eye-One LT is for you. If you're a tweaker, save yourself time and money and buy the Eye-One Display 2.With that said, the tool worked quickly and easily on my HP LP2475W, MacBook Pro, and Dell D620. The picture quality was dramatically improved. The best picture on the MacBook Pro did come after upgrading to the Display 2 so that I could use the native color temperature of the MBP. It also allows calibration of brightness.In my opinion, it was worth it. Some of my older pictures look better than ever and now I know that what I'm seeing on the screen is what it's supposed to look like."

76435,1,"I have been a user of TurboTax for about 10 years. As far as I'm concerned, unless you want the collaboration of a human Tax Accountant, this is the way to go.Now, admittedly, I'm prejudiced. I've practically grown up with the product. And there are situations where no computer program can handle things - the 'simplified' tax laws seem to be designed to provide financial security for CPAs. But for most people, just going through much the same interview you'd go through with your tax man with TurboTax will get a set of forms done.The program is stable, and all the calculations seem to be accurate. I consider that I am an average tax payer (1040 long form - married) and the job takes me about 3 hours - in discontinuous chuncks on MY schedule (Try THAT with an accountant).There are times when I find it difficult to enter things I KNOW need to be entered, and making changes can sometimes be a bit arduous - but I'm sure part of this because I only do this once each year (thank God!)One caveat: Intuit seems to develop updates on a continuing basis. Downloading these is fine if you have a broadband connection. But for those who still have dial-up, I'd heartilly recommend avoiding updates until you're ready to print or file electronically."

19792,0,"I have LOVED Nancy Drew games for as long as I can remember. Everytime one comes out I have had to get my hands on it. I was a little behind on this one because I haven't heard alot of raving reviews. After starting the game I realized that the game play was a little slower and the air didn't have the ""mystery"" that is often found in the other games. The storyline while fun and very unique doesn't flow well throughout the game. I was constantly wondering what to do and where to go because there aren't alot of leads or puzzles. The characters and dialogue were just 'ok' but nothing compared to games like Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake or Shadow Ranch!"
92508,0,"I gave this movie 3 stars simply because the storyline and script was very good. However, the acting was a disappointment. There was absolutely zero chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Michael Varitan. I am a huge Varitan fan which is part of the reason I rented it. I really think they could have casted this movie much better. On the same token I think Jane Fonda played the perfect evil mother-in-law (even though, for the recored, I am not a Fonda fan.) Hopefully in the future movies will be cast according to talent and not according to who is the hot commodity of the moment."
11312,0,"First, the installer always tries to install its own USB phone driver. If you already have a driver (for example the OEM driver), this new driver is unnecessary. But there is no option to not install it. If drivers are already installed, this part of the installation crashes, but leaves the rest of the product installed. The updater also crashes when it hits this part, but seems to update the rest of the product. Not a good first impression.I've used this with my LG vx5500, which it says it supports. It does not actually synchronize data, but simply overwrites. It reads from Outlook and writes to the phone, replacing anything already in the phone. This is both for contacts and calendar events.For contacts, it always writes to the phone as FIRST, LAST. There is no option to order by FILE AS or any other field.For calendar events, it can't read tasks or notes from Outlook, only events. It only shows the event subject in the phone; the location and body text are ignored. There are no options to configure this behavior.Overall, this product does work, but the above limitations seriously limit its usefulness. For a product that has been out for years, it seems more half-baked than I expected."
68542,1,"This is the first release by Corel of a KPT product, the previous were re-badged after being bought from MetaCreations. Reading a description of a filter doesn't really do it justice. Scatter is one of my favourites, and while it does scatter images over a pattern until you play with it you can't really judge the variations possible. You can create a series of spiral arms, or add a load of images in a mask to fill a shape, create a blanket of snow with a ragged edge. Similairly with the lightning effect you can control and create very realistic lightning, or make a comet, or a coloured laser beam. Hypertiling is very powerful, and it can create some interesting patterns. The pyramid paint allows some impressionist type images to be made quickly, but it can also be used to totally chnage the colours in an image to change a desert into an artic scene.To get the most out of the filters you need to experiment, which has always been the case with KPT filters. Using the recall panel and saving presets makes it easy to get back to an interesting setting.It is good to see a four colour landscape manual in the box too."

When I went to WIN XP it was simply a matter of getting the XP updates which work fine---although I did have to add one line the blackice.ini to get it start automatically which was suggested in the FAQs. As far as program protection goes, all one has to do is let Black Ice profile the computer to see what installed programs are present and that takes care of that.

Many apps were actually usable. With CPUs becoming faster, Virtual PC will be a pleasure to use. You can't play games that use a lot of 3D graphics, but simple games are somewhat playable, even games like SimCity 3000. If you want to run Windows apps on a Mac, get the new version."

The characters are interesting and their speech is well enunciated. The content is entirely age appropriate and innocent - which is rare in this day and age.The directions are very clear and I imagine if I set aside time every day to use this program, our daughter will be reading by age five.We own other Reader Rabbit CDs and they are all wonderful...I would strongly recommend these products for children ages three to six."

The game design is simplistic but the kids love it and were able to complete it without aid from us.The age range says 6 and older however kids older than 8 or 9 will not find this game dynamic enough and will become easily put out."

10157,1,"Being a MS-DOS, &amp; Windows 3.1 user for years made Windows 98 Second Edition a whole new world to explore! I like the way Windows 98SE has USB capability and a nice Software Table Synth MIDI!

27692,1,"I just balanced my checking account in 3 minutes so I felt compelled to put up a review proclaiming how great MS Money is.First off, I was shocked to see that the overall rating for Money is so low. I tried to use Quicken Deluxe 2001 a while back and aside from hating the UI I just never felt that it worked very well. Things like balancing my account and paying bills online were awkward and I eventually gave up.Money, on the other hand, has a beautiful, intuitive UI, makes balancing my accounts simple and sometimes automatic, and provides incredibly smooth online integration. The epay feature lets me pay all of my bills through money and they automatically get entered into my credit union's online bill pay system. Anytime something goes wrong, for example if I enter a date that's too early or if I haven't entered an address to send the bill, Money handles it smoothly.I should note that my experience with MS Money is limited to entering and categorizing all of my transactions, electronic bill pay, and balancing my accounts so I can't comment on any of the reporting or budgeting features.I noticed that a few of the negative reviews are from people that say they have a hard time managing their finances and it's not surprising these people would be let down. Money can't do everything for you and I spend a significant amount of time making sure everything is kept up to date. However, if you are willing to invest time to track your finances Money is definitely an application you should consider."
41305,1,"I'm 16 and have probably played this game since i were 10. Obviously much less, but I still haven't grown sick of it. I've probably completed the game 4-5 times. I even got my 40-year-old father to finish it. Great game for children 8 and up. Good graphics and tons of secret areas."
66886,0,I thought this program would be easier to navigate than it is. I never had any problem entering the data. My problem is the address fields and getting them to print on different size envelopes. I ended up printing the User's Guide so I wouldn't have to deal with the small windows in the help guide. I think it will be a good software program but it isn't as simple as it looks. I wish I had someone to guide me through it.

Home Designer Pro 7.0 will let you do most things and will work for a remodeling job. If you want to design a new house, you may want to consider investing in the full blown Chief Architect. These programs would be too hard for many people to use. They may want to consider hiring a professional with the money they would spend on this."
34438,1,"I am an American native speaker, was a Spanish major in college, lived in Madrid for about a year and a half and am (well, WAS) fluent in Spanish. I love Italy and have faked my way through Italian trips with my spanish for years. And then my husband ordered Rosetta Stone. It's wonderful! I'd heard about it for years, but had no idea that this system was so intuitively exciting. It's more fun than playing Freecell, or other addictive games on the computer!The system (an immersion approach, with picture recognition and hearing native speakers) is so natural, I couldn't believe it. I've done about half the first level and I find myself out on a walk and making up fun-sounding little italian phrases and sentences in my head. The teaching system is logical, gradual, progressive, challenging, exciting, quickly paces, never boring, and plain fun. I love the tapes for the car. My husband and I are both using it and we both love it.There are two negative reviews (here and on the level 1&2 software), both of which I find insubstantial. The one here complains, in essence, that you can't steal the software and give it away to your friends! That's fine with me. It's licensed for one computer, but you can have lots of users using that one machine. If you're honest and respect intellectual property rights, that won't be an issue for you.The second negative review asserts that the set-up is difficult for MAC users. I have a two iMACS (and am a 25 year PC user who just switched, so I'm completely PC oriented) and have just installed it on one of my machines. The installation was easy, flawless and the software works beautifully. The person who complained had a very sophisticated system and had trouble with some of his intricate settings. I am an Apple neophyte and trust me, for those of us with plug-and-play systems, this is a plug-and-play program. MAC users - don't worry! Get the software and start having fun."
61724,1,"Our four-year-old daughter loves Dora the Explorer, so we were delighted to see the release of Lost City Adventure. The reviews so far have been raves from the little one (and from us). The animation, music and sound are first rate, but more importantly, the challenges are appropriately measured for a pre-schooler. This program stacks up well against the Knowledge Adventure titles like Reader Rabbit. Skills such as sequencing, color matching, memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments. Plus, there are three difficulty levels, so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level, you can adjust accordingly.The program works great using the Classic environment on our Macintosh G4 laptop and G3 desktop computers. Have fun!"

I finally decided I will keep my printer plugged in and wait for the companies to do what they need to do. My very common asp Roadrunner has had trouble handing my e-mail. Apple did straighten that out after talking with a number of their staff. My asp helpers were clueless. I guess I'm going through the growing pains as many have with MS Vista-although my problems haven't been nearly as bad as that fiasco. Actually Leopard is a great product, but there a some trouble spots that need fixing."
80952,0,"I came to PC-cillin with high expectations, based on other reviews. And like other reviewers, I'm impressed by (1) its low price, (2) the quality of its antivirus program and the frequency with which definitions are updated, (3) the fact of free tech support by phone and e-mail, and (4) the whole program's relatively low impact on computer memory and speed.On the other hand, knowledgeable users seem concerned about the quality of its firewall - a concern corroborated by PC Mag's new review (www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1727551,00.asp) and by the failure to cloak ports on my computer. Moreover, the spyware filter failed to catch two suspicious files flagged by another leading program. And the antispam filter has only about an 80% success rate in my experience.More worrisome are the bugs. At first PCC would hang while attempting to download updates -- a problem eventually fixed by uninstalling the program (which I had loaded from a CD) and reinstalling it from the Trend Micro website. But two more issues have been unresolvable despite countless hours spent with various tech support people and several escalations. First, the e-mail scanner fails to display a pop-up confirmation, leaving me less than certain that the scans are happening reliably. Second, when I awaken my computer from stand-by, Outlook Express freezes while attempting to download messages, requiring me to restart Windows. No need to recount the various suggestions made by the tech support people, some reasonable and some clearly silly. All have failed. (At one point, the T.M. level-2 techie had me scan for spyware with another company's program -- a tacit admission of PCC's inadequacy.)I very much wanted (and expected) to like PC-cillin, but it has cost me an enormous amount of time and still doesn't work properly. Even if I persevere and these issues are solved at some point, I'll probably disable the firewall and spyware features just as I've already gone back to another antispam program."
2565,1,"I bought this software from Amazon; last March (05). I spent weeks looking, calling and trying different payroll and accounting software.

84650,0,"I have mixed feelings about this program, which I have used extensively in my one week of ownership. It is one of the most useful and freeing programs I've ever found. Suddenly, entering notes for lengthy research projects became a breeze. However, this program crashes constantly. Although I am able to recover the text after a crash, the dictation portion is lost -- and I am unable to execute the correction procedure necessary for the program's effectiveness and voice recognition accuracy. This program was designed for dictating letters and similar, brief documents. I have learned, now, to break up note-taking sessions into smaller documents. Once you get past a couple of pages of dictation, you risk crashing the program."
88548,1,"If you want a program to teach you how to speak the basics in a fast, fun, simple way, this would be a good one. If you want a program that will teach you as if you were taught in school, including grammar, writing, and verb conjugation(I did, she saw, we went, etc.), you will probably be disappointed. This program gives you two CD-ROM's per language, one for basics, one for intermediate level learning. The first CD, &quot;Talk Now&quot; gives you excercises in foods, colors, phrases, body parts, numbers, time, shopping, and countries. Under each heading, you play two word games, record yourself speaking and compare it to native speakers(your computer needs a microphone to do this), print vocabulary flash cards, and play a &quot;Memory&quot;-style game with the words you learned. They work on the premise that people remember things better if they've learned in fun situations. Though a bit cheesy at times, it _is_ fun, and you _will_ build your basic vocabulary. The second CD jumps more to full sentences, listening skills, identification, and writing dictation, all still in game-like form. It's a bit of a leap in knowlege, and can be a bit frustrating, but it's a good start for 'learning by listening', much as you would if you were struggling in the actual country, only without making a fool of yourself. At this level, if you have never been exposed to the language, the help/? icon becomes your best friend. Still little in grammar and verb forms, though. To get the most out of it, I would also recommend purchasing a pocket dictionary of the language(s), and maybe even one of those &quot;500 [the language] Verbs&quot; books, so you can actually have a better understanding of your vocabulary and how to form sentences. Overall, these programs are fun &amp; effective as a means of learning to speak, by yourself (or with a friend), on your own time."
55864,0,"This is a ""no brainer"" program. As long as you follow the interview you can get through it. But They don't always ask the questions you need and if you find you've left something out it can take all night trying to figure out how to get the information onto your tax form. It's sometimes difficult to find the information you need. But it beats the heck out of trying to understand the IRS instructions."
84068,1,"We purchased a compaq laptop with Vista Home on it for a great price. I'm MCP and A+ certified, so I felt an upgrade to Vista Business would not be a problem. This software did exactly what it was supposed to do. However, if you decide to perform an upgrade, be aware that some of the drivers may not be included in the upgrade. I spent a couple of hours with Compaq chat technicians to help me locate the drivers for the wireless network card, and about 4 other items that did not function after the upgrade. I expected this to occur, but felt it was worth getting the functionality for our network from Vista Business rather than staying with Vista Home. I briefly considered XP Pro, but having had experience trying to get a new OS platformed laptop to 'go backwards' to an old OS, I decided that staying in the Vista family was preferable. Another consideration when moving to Vista (especially from XP or W2K) are printer drivers. We had a terrific, newer HP all-in-one (copier, printer,fax) which lost its photo software after we moved from W2K to Vista. The copier/printer/fax operations worked, but I had no photo processing software and HP said they were sorry, but had no plans to provide a Vista version."

My monitor appears dim, the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull. If I had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor I wouldn't have wasted my time. My hope was that it would make my monitor look better, not worse. I am not at all satisfied with this product wouldn't recommend buying it.

60162,1,"I bought a AverMedia EZMaker DVD PCI card and was disappointed with the quality... the price was great, but video where the camera was in motion (panning left to right, for example) was very pixellated. The NeoDVD software that came with it was horrible; it dropped frames so all my videos looked like the scary part from &quot;The Ring&quot;. Using Roxio's Easy DVD Creator software was better, but still pixelated.So I took a chance and bought Pinnacle Systems Studio AV/DV 9 from the local Best Buy ($10.00 more than the Amazon price, but I figured I could return it easier if I wasn't happy with the quality.)The picture is DVD-perfect.. I can't complain at all, it just looks great. The Studio 9 software that comes with it is awesome, full-featured enough for professional movies, it seems to me. The only complaint I could possibly make is the rendering speed. I have a medium-quality system (1.1GHz with 512M RAM) and a top quality Video card (ATI Radeon Pro) and rendering a half hour of mixed video to DVD takes well over an hour and a half. Burning the finished product to DVD takes about 15-20 minutes. But even the time is not a big deal; I just set it to burn before I go to bed and when I wake up it's done.I had absolutely no problems with installation or setup, it was up and running in less than 20 minutes. Be warned that video editting is a HardDrive HOG. The Studio 9 software came on a CD and a DVD. An hour's worth of video takes up many GiGs of drive space!So the Pinnacle Systems Studio AV/DV 9 card works great, and the software alone is worth the price."

Not only do I enjoy this games myself, my engineer husband enjoys it, too. This version comes with two games: an easier game for the younger kids and a harder version for the older kids and adults. Even when the children finally tire of the puzzles, they are willing to spend many more hours on building their own experiments. I love how the game encourages the children to think logically and stretch their minds in a new way."

69488,1,"I love Creatures so much that one reason I got a PC is because they stopped making updated versions for Macintosh ! LOL. Creatures 2 is a lot like the first version, except the world is much bigger, the norns look slightly different but are still cute as can be, and there are more types of norns, which is fun ! You can even convert your Creatures One Norns into Creatures 2 norns using the 'nornverter' in your Creatures 2 folder ! So if you had any favorite norns you can update them into this new 'world'. It's great relaxation caring for the norns, and it's great for kids I think, it uses the imagination. The norns reproduce but not visibly... you just hear Pop ! (while one norn walks near another) and an egg soon appears from which hatches a brand new norn. The grendel is the 'bad guy' but all he can do is spread germs or hit them, and he mostly stays underground by the volcano.Creatures 2 has a lot of fun things with it, especially if you get the Deluxe version with Lifekit #1. Even a helicopter ! Watching the look on the Norns' faces when flying around in the helicopter is hilarious ! You can even click on 'view' to see what they are thinking about or seeing. It's fun to think that they are actually 'looking' at something -- sometimes it's offscreen and until you click on 'view' you wouldn't even have known they were eyeing a carrot or toy in the distance. Hard to explain but this game is really unique.A lot of people online are obsessed by this game, and invent new things for it and everything. Net search on Norns to see what I mean ! There is even a Creatures newsgroup. Anyway Creatures 2 is even more fun than Creatures One. I didn't like Creatures 3 as much, for various reasons. But if you liked Creatures (One), you'll love this one also ! There are lots of additions and improvements. Night falls, weather and seasons change, norns can even drown; but there are safeguards against that (i.e. PUFFER FISH rescue !). Their facial expressions are priceless. And when a new little baby 'nornlet' hatches -- all I can say is, awww ! (The norns have life stages even, such as infant, youth, adult, and 'pensioner' and their gait, and appearance, change accordingly). Well, now, I'll let you search online and check it out for yourself ! Have fun !"

19552,1,"The premise of ""Mystery Case Files: Huntsville"" is a simple one - there is a crime spree in Huntsville that is baffling police and players need to find hidden objects to solve the crimes. Once enough objects are found in a round, the players have to solve a puzzle that identifies the criminal and they move on to the next round. There are 16 crimes to solve (including the final one in Big Boss's secret hideout); dozens of locations (including Alice's Diner, a Bookstore, Ivan's Caf&eacute;, Pete's Pawnshop, and the Art Museum); and dozens of objects to find like paper clips, marbles, bats, clocks, playing cards, coins and dice. Each level is timed so you have to find the objects before time runs out.""Mystery Case Files: Huntsville"" is the first hidden object game in the Mystery Case Files series, in my opinion the best hidden object series. The games starts off easily enough with two locations, 16 clues to find (8 in each location), and 20 minutes to find them all, and gets progressively harder as the game goes along until the final round which gives you only four minutes to find the objects and solve the puzzle. If you are new to the series, you may find you run of time in the beginning before finding al the objects, but that's okay because you can start over again with different objects to find. Don't click too fast when looking for objects or you'll lose time. Some of the objects are out in the open and easy to find while others are well hidden. If you find yourself stuck, leave the location and go to another one, you'll find objects are easier to find the next time you return to that location. Some of the clues are a bit tricky, for example if you need to find a bat, you could be looking for either a baseball bat or the mammal. Each level has three hints that can be used to either find an object or move a puzzle piece. Make sure you use the hints wisely - sometime you need to find more than one object (like three stamps) and the hint will only show one of these items, not all three.Since this is the first Mystery Case Files game, it's not as complex as some of the later games in the series (like Madame Fate) and is perfect for people new to the Hidden Objects games. Since some of the locations are repeated throughout the game, you'll be able to locate clues quicker in those locations as the game progresses. It doesn't take a long time to play, maybe five or six hours total, but it can be played over and over again since you need to find different items every time you play. Although this is a single player game, others can sign on in another name and play separately without losing the place you are in. The final level, Big Boss's Hideout, is the most frustrating level since there is only four minutes to solve the whole thing.""Mystery Case Files: Huntsville"" is hours of puzzling fun."
72818,1,"This program is much better than one of those expensive personal weather stations you can buy for your house. In addition to temperature, humidity, wind, and barometer, you also get high and low temperatures for the day, rate of rain fall, total rain for the day and month.

That way I can see approaching storm fronts, watch the storm's progress through our area, and watch it finally exit. This is one awsome program!"

I found this for a lot less at CompUSA and I bought the new computer version when I upgraded from a 10 to a 40 GB hard drive, so it was infact just like ""a new computer"" when I installed this.First of all, let me say that I am very glad I bought this. XP has taken care of pretty much all of the computer nightmares that I had with ME. The only complaint I have is with battery life. XP uses up more battery life and so my laptop doesn't run on the battery for as long as it's suppossed to. Also, the Windows Firewall that comes with Service Pack 2 doesn't work that well. It's better than nothing (I think). My dad had horrible problems with his computer before I convinced him to purchase the Norton Personal Firewall 2004."
391,1,"Like almost everyone on the planet, I've used Office for Windows extensively and initially I was a bit put off by Mac Office as it does look and feel different (what the hell is Entourage anyway?).However on working with it more you get used to it, and it has some nice features that the Windows version doesn't.3+Entourage - I have really come to like the app - I use it as a replacement for Palm Desktop (Memos), Address Book (it is a little 'richer'), and Mail (it does hotmail as well as POP &amp; IMAP), and everything integrates well.Ability to mark a doc for followup - Office will give you a reminder, even when it's not running.It's Office, right? It does almost everything.3-While docs are compatible with Windows versions, I have had problems with complex spreadsheets, so I do not think it is 100% perfect.It is a little sluggish (800mhz G4 iMac, Panther, 512mb).Entourage's calendar management isn't as good as iCal - can't publish/subscribe, or even import/export data. More generally, Entourage isn't very 'open' - it shares data well with other parts of the app, but not other apps.Overall, it does what you expect and let's face it, it's the de facto standard for a reason. Expensive thought!"

For example, if you want to make an object transparent so you can work behind it, you will not be able to restore that object to its original state when you are done. The same goes for soft edges. If you feel you would like to adjust the edge you applied a few steps back, you're out of luck.I personally don't know why they call it an upgrade if they remove features as well.Overall, this is a great program and if you've never used another version of DIP you might be satisfied, but if you have... consider it carefully before upgrading."
6432,0,"I know I'm not the only one who is thinking this, but this movie has been seriously overrated by the critics. Don't get me wrong. The movie was entertaining and it kept my attention. I'm just not convinced that its the ground breaking movie that the critics have been trying to make it out to be.I've seen this type of movie many times before. A happy family is living the good life. The ""parents"", although different in personality and ambition, are a functional and happily married couple. They have two really good kids who seem to be happy. The wrinkle(there is always a wrinkle) is that the two children are byproducts of artificial insemination. Yes, their parents are two gay women. Twenty years ago, a movie such as this may have been a seminal movie that was capable of inciting vigorous debate about a controversial social issue, like the criticism of Murphy Brown did in the 80's after Dan Quayle criticized her show because it focused on single motherhood. The problem with this movie is that its general plot is not all that new. This type of movie has been done before, and it has been done a lot better. Maybe the circumstances of the characters have changed, but the alternative circumstances of characters did not add to the originality of the film.The principle players in the film are all proficient in their roles; however, I cannot honestly say that anyone really stood out in this film. And yet Mark Ruffalo and Annette Benning receive Oscar nominations for their performances. They have both been in movies in which they have performed better. Julianne Moore is good, but she hardly stood out. And the kids were the kids. Perfectly serviceable, but again not great. So I fail to see what is so good about this movie.Also, I would think that if you were a gay woman you might be somewhat offended by this film. Julianne Moore is in a committed relationship with another woman for years, and then all of sudden a male paramour suddenly enters her life and she forgets that she is a lesbian and starts to have sex with the male. This was an unbelievable plot twist.So, see the movie on Blue Ray or DVD if you want to. Like I've said before you won't be bored. Just don't expect to have your mind blown."
62949,2,"I would consider an alternate product, I am sorry to say. I got this product from Amazon.com, and, although I have not tried to return it yet, only hope I can if I am under 30 days (wish me luck &lt;g&gt;).How did I reach this point? I was enticed by how easy and useful it was to sync my Handspring Visor with the computer. I bought it hoping my laptop and my desktop would become the best of friends. I installed it on one computer with WindowsME and AOL5.0, and it was easy. I attempted to install it on another desktop with Windows98and AOL6.0, and although the installation was easy, it always created GPFs when I tried to run PCSync. In consultation with customer support, I've installed this (with their ministrations and suggestions) a lot of times now (more than 10), and still have yet to get it to work one the Windows 98 computer.Customer service was notable for the following: I contacted PCSync,and left copious messages on the board they run to offer customer service. To make a long story short, customer service 1) oftentimes did not answer my postings on the board. 2) had a _long_ wait time in excess of 20 minutes when I called them long distance on multiple occaisions 3) before I was ready or willing, closed my account on the board, without giving me a definitive solution. Note well: my tone, both in writing and in voice, was consistent with this message. To be fair, at this writing, they say they will &quot;have a senior technician get back with you&quot; when they have a solution, but their reticence at communication so far. . . Well, you can figure it out from there.Nope, although there are other products out there that work and work well, this is not one of them. Take your hard earned money, register Winzip, and transfer your data files via another route. It's cheaper, quicker, and, unlike with this product, predictable.I do hope that someone out there gives due consideration to synchronization between palmtops, laptops, and desktops. If someone can come up with &quot;universal synchronization&quot; between these three devices, they will be rich. Documents to Go, also available via Amazon, does it between a computer and a palmtop, and some programs try to do it between a desktop and a laptop, but, whoever does it between a laptop, desktop, and palmtop, will fill a niche that ever increases in an increasingly mobile computing world.Best wishes from Edmund5169"
61141,1,Like the improvements of this version. Highly recommend for graphic designers or artists.
92858,1,"Nobody can complain about the time between upgrades when a company releases an upgrade like this. I knew my life would be fullfilled when notation software came with a ""sync to film"" feature. This latest version of Sibelius does that and so much more. I've been a Sibelius user since version 2, and nothing has excited me more than version 4. These guys continue to get it done right, upgrade after upgrade. I am a student, working toward my master's degree in commercial music, and I'm also a composer, and a copyist by trade. I use Sibelius for everything from lead sheets to full wind band scores, and for all of my personal and business needs. I can't imagine working any other way or with any other program. (I used to use Finale, too, but I've finally decided that it's not worth it to upgrade anymore... everything is more difficult to do, and they just keep copying Sibelius, anyway.) The new ""dynamic parts"" feature is a genius addition to the program, and it saves me and my colleagues a lot of time. (If it's not saving you time, then you aren't using it correctly!) And, while I am not really in need of many of the educational features in the program, I've found that if you're creative about the ways in which you choose to employ those features, you can make them work for you, whether you're an educator or professional. Besides that, with a focus on education, the company maintains an ease of use that nobody else can match. I like how they're striving to make their quick keys more universal -- turning the space bar into a ""playback"" quick key makes it easier for users like me to switch off between sequencing programs and Sibelius, for example. Personally, I can't wait to see what the next major upgrade will be like, especially now that they've merged with M-Audio...I'm hearing very exciting rumors of Pro Tools integration, and vice-versa. Very excited. Love it!!"
75177,1,Very good product which came in perfectly packed and was easy to install. I definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a HD.
3816,1,"Simply the smoothest, easiest media program I've used. If you're tired of complicated disk authoring programs emc8 is a welcome relief. I'm surprised how much could be done with a few clicks. The video, photo, audio programs are also good programs. They don't stray too far from normal Windows menu styles. There are a few unique features too that put the editing programs above average in quality. I was able to cut and then move around some video clips an a different order than the original footage. Before buying I emailed roxio to ask what would happen if the program didn't work at all on my pc. They answered within one day and said they could out something, even by phone if there were serious problems. They wouldn't charge anything as long as I stuck to trying to solve the installation problem. It turns out that the program worked fine and my fears did not come true."

I wasted a lot of time dealing with MS and I finally got an email from them telling me that this software was not designed for this type of use and that it might be considered for future release. I wasted my money since I need VPN to remote to work PC's. I am glad I only paid 14.99 at CC when it was first intruduced. If you are a regular user, it is a good choice since it has good anti spy-ware tool."

I did get an error page on the Adobe site, but nothing that indicated registration wouldn't be possible. I had no problem installing and opening the programs in the kit. I bought this package for the full copy of Flash MX, but I'm pleased that I got some great additional Adobe products with the kit. Also the seller upgraded my shipping to priority at no cost to myself. This was a pleasant surprise."

The 3d graphicsare great and the music goes along with the different scenes.My daughter rarely lets me move around the scenes, but I am always there for the tough situations she cannot quite figure out yet. We scream and fuss at different situations, and therehave been times when we cannot go to sleep, we just have tofigure it out. It's a cd for parents and kids to spend timetogether. We are waiting for the 6th one to come out. Everyoneshould try at least one Nancy Drew, I'm sure they would enjoy italso. The stay tuned for danger game had two cd's, I prefer only one, it gets to be a bother having to switch out cd's, otherwise the game was fun also. Let us know when the 6th one comes out!"

If you start the Singleplayermode, you will recognise that you play Kyle Katarn again, just like in the previous part. In the first part of Jedi Knight, Jason Court was the actor and in Jedi Knight 2, Kyle looks like the real Jason Court. If you guys start the Multiplayermode, I give you a little tip: open the console by pressing Shift and ^. Enter ''bind +taunt'' and press the button 3. Type 3 and your model will speak.

33277,0,"I have had this program for over a year now or so, and use it quite frequently. The search capabilities in this program are top-notch, as you can define very complex searches (ie: [God / Jesus] + [Christ / Lord] - cruc*] will result in all results that have God or Jesus AND Christ or Lord AND do not have any variation of cruc in it - like crucifixion, crucify ...). Also, the resources on this program are very good - look at Biblesoft's website to see a complete listing of products. Ok, now to what I don't like about the product.1. They have a section in their options that states that they recomend you not change anything in this section, because ""2.1 Compatibility - these settings are required in PC Study Bible version 3.0 and above and should not be changed."" - why have them included in the options section then I ask you?2. If you have user profiles enabled in Windows, the program only installs it's reg keys to the user profile you installed it with; this means that if you install it with the user profile of A, then restart the computer at a later time and sign in as user B, you will get an error message; there is a way around this - but you have to be knowledgable with the Windows registry - you have to manually copy the HKCU key for Biblesoft software to the user profile you want to use the program in.3. Every time you copy a selection from one of the resources (ie: Strong's Concordance, Thayer's, Nave's ...) it will copy your selection AND AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDE copywrite info - this is very annoying I have found - I understand their reasons, but I believe they could have found a better way.4. Add-ons are not free - look at add-on page ...for the cost, I would think they should be.5. Some misc. bugsAll in all, if you're just going to use this software to do minor Biblical studies, then this might be useful software for you; if you are planning on delving deep into the Scriptures, I recommend you not purchase this. I hear that Logos Bible Software is pretty complex - I have not checked it out myself, but I do know that this program is not all that I wanted in a program, and I am not satisfied for the price I paid for it."
67179,1,"I have used Quickbooks Basic for a number of years both in my church and for my business. I have kept QB 2004 Basic since the upgrades were not immediately necessary for me.I chose to upgrade this year to keep current on maintenance, etc. so again I chose the most basic product offered - ""Simple Start"". I received it just fine and it installed perfectly.However, it does not upgrade any previous QB files. As I investigated, Intuit says that it won't upgrade files from previous QB versions on their web site (albeit in small print) and on the product box itself, but that was not ever mentioned in the Amazon listing.So then I had to upgrade to the next higher version - an additional $80. QB Pro also works very well; it's just a shame that Intuit insists on misleading customers by not providing full information through all marketing channels. The Intuit phone rep also tried to overcharge me $20 for the upgrade but quickly accepted the correct amount when I pointed out their error a second time."
40219,0,"These ""Adventure Workshop"" packages are enough to drive a shopper crazy. If you haven't figured it out by now, you owe it to yourself to find out that there have been at least EIGHT DIFFERENT packages sold under this same title! The one I'm reviewing here is supposedly ASIN number B000063LGF, and the title includes no ""version"" number unlike most other Amazon listings for this product.However, the photograph looks like a package that I own, and that's what I'll comment about here. NOTE that in this photo, as in the one I own, there are *three* -- not four -- programs. Two are Reader Rabbit titles, and the other is ""Clue Finders"".The Reader Rabbit programs are just okay. They install reasonably well under XP and they cover the learning areas that they're supposed to. Our kid has played with both programs, both before and during first grade, and seems to want to keep them on the PC for now. We'll see if they get ignored when other programs get installed, though.I did not install the ClueFinders program at first because it was too advanced for a kid coming out of kindergarten. And now, I have discovered that the game in this box (""Mystery of the Monkey Kingdom"") is actually just an older version of a product known as ""ClueFinders 3rd Grade"" or ""ClueFinders The Mystery of Mathra"".Just try to sort this stuff out! The other version I have, with Mathra in the title, works better and appears to contain two separate adventures -- one of which is the Monkey Kingdom. So, obviously it is a better value than the version in this box.Most of these programs keep track of the user by name, and help the player progress through different difficulty levels. So, if you're on a budget and get a really good deal, this package of three titles might be a reasonable choice. If nothing else, it is fairly accurately targeted at the age range suggested by its title (unlike others in this series).But shop around. If you want to get the most out of the ClueFinders program, you'll want to get a newer version, and/or a version that has more different types of learning involved rather than just the Monkey Kingdom, which covers primarily Math."

Before you spend the extra money on Acrobat, try PDF Producer.By the way, you need Windows 2000, XP Home or Pro to run PDF Producer. It will not work on a Win 98SE or lower system.

60249,1,"SuSE linux is by far the best all around version of Linux for anyone who is used to Windows, or anyone new to Linux.First, let me clarify that it is not the best version to host webpages on. It is not the best version to emulate Windows on.Where SuSE does excell, though, is exactly where it counts most for the average person. SuSE is increasingly easier to install compared to other versions of Linux with each and every new release. Installing Linux is one of the worst changes to adapt to when switching from Windows, but SuSE automated everything. It's so close to idiot proof.On top of the easy installation, SuSE is a very smooth, quick, and user friendly OS. Almost every setting is automatically optimized for your hardware, where other Linux distributions have quite overwhelming in forcing you to configure everything. The hardware support is extensive and reliable. Any hardware conflicts I have seen in SuSE 8, and SuSE 9 have been resolved beautifully.There are only a few downsides to Linux in general for anyone considering running it for the first time. Be careful not to play around with files you are unfamiliar with. Also realize that KDE and Gnome may look similiar to Windows, but they are very different. You will have to learn how to use it correctly. Try buying a book on Linux or at least find a few websites with information on how to get started.Another thing to note about this version of Linux is the office suite built in. Windows users have come to expect to buy seperate word processing software. Do not fear, SuSE 10 has an extensive Office program that has software equally as useful, if not more, than Microsoft's Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and more.On top of an excellent office suite, you will find CD/DVD burning software, media players, and much more included in this box.What it comes down to is this: If you want a simple, cheap, and easy Operating System for a computer that will be primarily used for internet, email, and office applications, then this is for you. You can buy this one cheap piece of software and get everything you need for daily use. You will save hundreds of dollars over Windows, and even more over burning software and that expensive Microsoft Office.If you want to get into Linux for the first time, then this is for you.If you want to run a server, then try a different distribution of Linux with more focus on that.If you want to play alot of games and utilize the newest software, then stick to Windows."
7208,1,My daughter played this game for hours and loved it. Some have said that there is a 'bug' that prevents you from finding the singers for the coronation. But it CAN be done.
27827,2,"My son had a lot of fun with this software package, but it's not something where you can leave your kid with it and go do something else. The interface is confusing. The cursor often disappears and reappears during the normal course of loading the introduction to certain games, which makes it very confusing for a little guy who just got into a game he's already played and just wants to get out of the game but can't.Also, the interfaces are not consistant. Some use the gold arrow cursor all the time, while others have the cursur disappear and suddenly one of tha dog characters becomes directly manipulated by the mouse. Again, not consistent and can be quite confusing for a small child.Then there's the fact that it's really just about a half-dozen games that can be played through in about an hour, and then where do you go after that? To another software package, probably. Of course, there's three difficulty levels and that may make the games interesting for a second or third play.The bottom line is this is a cute but needlessly confusing (the maze with T-bone is really hard, not maze but the mouse interface) set of game software that will likely have you hovering over your child and helping him/her rather than going off and doing something while you're offspring use the computer."
18287,1,"In my experience really learning a language requires a mix of learning approaches. That means books, tapes, tutoring, and experience in a country that uses it.

26036,0,"Three things your readers might want to know: 1) There is no free online technical support ($10 per report sent is available) 2) You have one free call to tech support (then it is $20) 3) Updating the software is not through downloads from the website. The website lists that an SP1 is available for Omnipage Pro 14, but it can only be accessed through the help/webupdate feature in the program. Unfortunately the webudate doesn't work and though I have reported the bug twice, I got no communication from Sansoft and no information in their online ""knowledge base"" on how to solve this problem. Since I am in Europe, I haven't called their tech support, and in fact I am more than irritated that such a complicated method of software updates exists. When other software companies offer auto updates through the program (such as Microsoft Windows, Office, etc.) they also let you download directly when the auto method doesn't work or isn't convenient. I think your readers need to know the mindset of Sansoft before they buy a product that may be expensive and inconvenient to maintain."
44292,1,"Best price I have seen on this product, by far. The only other way that I have ever heard of getting this cheaper was to buy it through a school, but my school doesn't offer thes types of discounts. When I saw that Amazon had this at least $35 cheaper I was on it!! Even with tax and shipping I spent less than $100 which is awesome. I found the programs a bit hard to navigat at first, but I think it was just because they had the same set up for so many years. Once I figured it out, I didn't find it that difficult to find where things were located. Anway...great price for the most necessary product on a computer! Thanks Amazon."
68302,1,I bought for my grand daughter and shee has spent endless hours building the crazy machines.
84317,2,"I have performed about 12 Vista installations for clients so far and I still can't think of anything nice to say about it. The people who have said nice things about Vista here on Amazon MUST be Microsoft employees or shareholders, there is no other plausible explanation.If you are considering Vista, be sure you have a very new computer. You need a fast machine with lots of memory to make this work, and you need a newer machine to be sure that drivers are available for the components under the hood. This brings me to the second point, be sure to check with your PC manufacturer or peripheral(s) vendor to be sure that a Vista driver is available FIRST. There are a lot of systems and/or components that still do not have drivers for Vista yet! One of my clients bought a brand-new HP all-in-One printer for use with the Vista computer we built, and the driver disk in the printer box was useless, no Vista drivers were included. I went to HP's website and they only have a 'print' driver for the device. A driver which will allow him to use the scanning, and faxing capabilities of the printer will not be available for at least another two months. This isn't HP's fault; Microsoft was slow to release this to vendors so they are still writing drivers for this OS. If your computer says ""Vista Ready"" on it, don't be suckered into thinking you can slide into the digital 'EasyPass"" lane. That emblem is just a cheap sticky marketing ploy to sell product and in no way implies that there are already Vista Drivers available for your unit! I had two instances, both with Dell PC's, that said they were ""Vista Ready"". The sticker should have read, ""Will Eventually be Vista Ready"". The drivers will not be available for some time yet (no timeframe was offered from Dell Tech Support). There are a lot of sound cards, video cards etc... that this is also the case with, so do your homework ahead of time, and YES, YES, YES, download and use the free'Advisor' tool from Microsoft BEFORE you fork over your hard earned Benjamins to be sure this will work. The only machine that I found was 100% compatible with Vista out of the box by the way was my Fellowes Cross Cut 14 page shredder (purchased here on Amazon). It interfaced very nicely, and it appears that inserting the disc in that was much more productive than any PC I had tried up to that point.If you do manage to get this OS installed (kudos to you young Jedi), strap in for a frustrating few hours of getting to know your computer. Microsoft has assumed that its user-base is getting dumber by the minute and has developed a myriad of controls ""by default"" to keep you from hurting yourself. Not saying this is 'entirely' a bad thing, but the Big Brother act has gotten completely out of control with Vista. For the technically adept, be prepared to constantly repeat yourself (I have to click ""Allow"" 9 nines to install Norton AntiVirus), be prepared to find yourself pleading with your PC that you do in fact know what you are doing, and be prepared to find yourself in a place where mailing a $1300 computer to Redmond suddenly seems to be a logical alternative to sending yet another ""Microsoft Error Report"". Turning these controls off is not as easy as it should be and for the most part negates all of the 'security' controls Microsoft touts as a big selling point (ie. improvement over XP) in the first place.Bottom Line, We'll all be using Vista eventually anyway of course, but either buy it already installed on a PC, or do your homework (a lot of it) ahead of time, or better yet, wait at least until Service Pack 1 has been released. By then a pile of the bugs will have been worked out, and manufacturers will have caught up with the distribution cycle and have drivers available for all of your stuff. Trust me, there is nothing more pathetic than hearing a grown adult brought to wimpers, tears, and thoughts of digital Hari Kari over a shiny new piece of software. Don't let it happen to you."
24387,1,"This version of Oregon Trail brings the graphics and game-play into the 21st Century. Having played the 1985 version (available for Mac II, but we played it on Tandys back in the late nineties) and the version from 1992, this game is a sight for sore eyes in so many ways. For the time, the predecessors were great games, but of all the improvements made, the replay value is the star of the show.You can choose the month and year you set out, as well as different points of origin and different destinations -- groundbreaking compared to always going from Independence, Missouri to the Willamette Valley in Oregon. You can choose the ages AND names of your party, your occupation, you can fish as well as hunt, and you can buy specific increments of medicines (by the bottle), all types of food (by the pound), various textiles, even animals besides oxen. In fact, you can travel in three different types of wagons. The Learning Company obviously tried to make the experience more custom and more personal to each wagon party, which makes for a much more interesting experience.You still cross rivers, talk to strangers, set your pace/rations, and all of that good stuff, but the rivers' graphics and hunting scenery looks very cool, and the people are realistic-looking trailgoers. The water shines and ripples, and the various landscapes change as you move through the untamed wilderness to match the terrain you're crossing through at the time (it often looks like a collage; I'm very partial to it). TLC stayed true to what works in the game, while adding new content that keeps things interesting. One of the most awesome new features I was not expecting is the gathering ability. Right next to fishing and hunting, one may gather edible parts of herbs and fruits. You can click ""look up"" and it tells you whether or not it is poisonous, and it is pretty easy to learn what to take and what to throw out, so in a few minutes, you've gotten multiple factual botany lessons, have familiarized yourself with what these plants look like, and have acquired pounds of nutritious and healthy food to eat on the trail. Also, there is an ""automated diary"" that writes about what you traded for, who you met, news you heard, what you bought, where you rested, how many pounds of food you gathered, et cetera; if you buy decks of cards, fiddles/banjos/harmonicas, checkers or any amusement, the party will use it and notate as such in the diary. Though it fills such details in itself, you can type your own notes and observations, as well as flip through the diary to read past entries. I like referring to past entries in the diary from time to time; it's nice that simple things like that do not go unnoticed. The older versions of the game spoke of a ""trail log"" and you had the option to export it and read it in a Word file, but this is a bona fide log of events, and reading them later on can be quite humorous.The storyline of Cass and her family is not mandatory and you can click through the cut-scenes if you want to skip them. It is just a companion storyline that unfolds as the same pace as your own. The first time I played, I watched them; they are not corny, and though they are not geared towards me at the age of 21, I am a history lover who wants to learn about a chapter of history that I don't really know that much about; Cass' story is pretty universal, so I did learn a thing or two. I'm a big fan of classic games, and having loved this so as a kid, I was bound to try and get my hands on this. I am glad I did. Every element that makes this Oregon Trail was enhanced, and the countless ravines, rivers, camps, forts and passes make no two journeys alike.I LOVE this game!*A few tips: Things I've learned the hard way:*-With this more advanced game, rest is no longer a cure-all. Nothing beats back or prevents disease like trading/buying 5lb sacks of fresh/dry fruit, fresh/dry vegetables, and stocking up on ALL MEDICINES before leaving your first town!-Fish and hunt when you can to have supplies of fresh food, and if you get desperate, don't forget that you can still trade at any time on the trail.-Don't give up on injured animals -- Resting 2-3 days heals them the majority of the time.-Make SURE you have x2 spare wagon wheels, axles and tongues NO MATTER WHAT -- buy them from the wagon & parts vendor at the beginning of the game for a killer price. If your parts start breaking on the trail, traders will want insane things (like 1 or more oxen, your only rifle/shotgun, etc.) in exchange for a replacement, and the more you haggle, the higher the demands go in amount, so it's better to not get that desperate.-Get to your destination before Dec 15. I'm sure you're aware of the coldness of Winter, but after mid-December, it's no joke, and if your people do make it with winter coats and such, the morale may suffer for so long that you lose the game by being removed as party leader.-The game provides you with many supplies to buy. Be sure to pay attention to how many pounds each unit for sale is. Don't buy three 100-pound anvils or x10 20lb sacks of rice or else, all OTHER items included, your wagon will be too heavy to even leave town (much less make it across a muddy river bed)! Buy a little bit of everything, the essentials first. You want a wagon that is about 4,000 pounds or less (the max is 5,000 pounds)."

66604,1,"I am again pleased with SUSE with the newest release of their brand of Linux. A soundly quality product with many bonuses. The installation is easier than ever (installation with SUSE was always among the best). It works great with my wireless network, unlike many other distros which I have tried. Setting up SUSE Professional as a network server is relatively easy, using it for a desktop OS is even easier. I highly recommend it. Out of 8 distros I have tried over the past 3 years, SUSE provides a much better product than the others.SUSE 8.2 works great on my Compaq Presario 12XL410 Laptop too (which is also set up with a wireless NIC). This came as somewhat of a surprise as I have been having a multitude of problems getting Linux on this laptop for over 2 years. SUSE 8.1 and 8.2 both work on this laptop just fine with no problems installing or operation.SUSE has included a firewall program called Firewall2 that is nothing less than superb. It is incredibly secure setting it up during install right out of the box. With a bit of additional tweaking you'll have an exceptionally secure network connection to the internet.Downloading patches or security updates is an integrated function of SUSE Professional 8.2 and works quite well. Also, updating the the distro (such as going from Samba 2.2.7 to 2.2.8a) is just as easy as any Microsoft product."

In my opinion an OS should be light and operate quietly in the backround. It's supposed to be just a tool for productivity!Microsoft has gotten way too big for it's britches. I think they have forgotten the basic philosophy of a good operating system. Progress isn't measured by time it's measured by ingenuity, and Vista has nothing to offer. Also I'm highly suspicious of all the positve reviews. Don't believe them, Vista is terrible."

71534,1,"Roxio advertises POPCORN as a copier for non-encryted DVDs, of course, they know that many consumer are not buying the product for this reason. Popcorn has the ability to burn a dvd from VIDEO_TS files. Therefore, using a free DVD ripper program, you can create backups of your DVDs very easily. Popcorn works perfectly, and should be priced higher. The compresser works like a charm, and I think a 5-year old could do it. If you're looking to make backups of both commerical and other DVDs, this is perfect. This is the real deal, of course if you don't use a ripper it is quite pointless (except for things that a Videographer might give you which are usually not encrypted, like from a Wedding)."

The Editor is designed to show you what the movie would look like on a TV screen, but if you're producing for the web then you have no idea what the final output will look like until you do it. The results are always washed out and low contrast. There's no way to tell Final Cut that you're working on a web video, so don't screw with the colors - just show me what it will look like on a computer screen, not a TV."

45287,1,"This is currently my favorite game. I have not really taken to other Pool/Snooker games I have played, but this provides that blend of good gameplay and nice aesthetics that has kept me playing. The first thing that pulled me in was the beautiful graphics and sound. The look of the balls and table are clearly better than other Pool games I have looked at. It really has a photo-realistic quality. Beyond that, the AI and physics seem excellent. The game provides AI opponents (over 70) that seem to have real human-like play characteristics. I have only played the 8-ball in depth, but the Snooker also looks very convincing. There are no 3D animated characters I'm afraid, but nice mugshots with full player descriptions. The 3 environments are pretty good, but not up to the quality of the balls and table.Net, this is a strong recommendation. It is a cool game that has clearly hooked me to my PC to the early hours, so I guess that says it all!"

Using the Roxio Updater (Tools -&#62; Extras & Utilities -&#62; Roxio Updater) I also downloaded the free upgrade to version 7.0.1 of the software. During my 6 months of use I contacted Roxio's customer tech support a few times via email, and every time they got back to me within a day or so with answers to my questions. That's pretty darn impressive support for software costing well under $100. Beyond the technical stuff, this software is pretty amazing on how easy it is to use and how quickly I was creating some way cool looking DVDs of my home movies and digital pictures."

When I saw this kit on [...], I thought I'd give it a try.I had a photo of my dog, who passed away last year, and I thought it would be a good image to make 3D. I just printed out the image and I'm pleased to announce that it works really well.Here's how it works: You open your image in the software that's provided on CD. Then you have to outline the image using their tool. Finally, you print out the image.I would have given this item 5 stars if it wasn't for the software, which could be better, and the electronic manual, which was sparse. But the process is simple enough that you should be able to figure everything out relatively easily.You can surprise a loved one with a 3D photo that you made yourself. How cool is that?"

I still hate to have to pay this every year for what is, essentially, a tax law update package. Turbotax uses the data from my previous years' files on my harddrive, uses the same tax law changes available from the IRS website, and so one, so why is there not an upgrade version at a seriously reduced price? (I know, I know, you can get a rebate if you purchase Quicken 2006 at the same time, you can 'write off' the cost of Turbotax, etc...) I think I know the answer (it has to do with software company revenue projections, etc...).All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone whose tax and financial situation isn't too incredibly complex."

Tobegin with, the only way to install it on my older Mac (although the computerfit the System Requirements listed on the box) was to erase the entire harddrive. Second, I have had trouble with the system quitting ""unexpectedly.""The new Search Light feature is impressive, and the dashboard widgets arefun, but many only provide slightly faster access to things you wouldalready have been able to get without much trouble. (A calculator, a calendar,a Google Images search window, etc.) I do love the one that allows youto listen to all BBC radio stations in real time from your desktop, and thereare some fun simple little games. There are some random interesting things (Astronomy picture of the Day, for instance, or one that displays the lyrics of the rock or pop songs you're playing in iTunes) but I don't think these substantiallyimprove my computing experience, and they aren't worth what the upgradecosts. They are enjoyable, but not essential. The mail program is not substantially different. Mac should have developed more improvements before askingits customers to buy yet another OS X upgrade.For someone who uses a computer primarily for email, internet, photos, andword-processing, this system doesn't have many advantages, and it seemsstill to have some bugs in it. Still, the widgets can provide you with hoursand hours of procrastination (just browsing through them and trying them outcan occupy days).I remain, however, a loyal Mac proponent."

51023,1,"I am not going to repeat the pro's and con's other people have written about WordPerfect. I have only one question today: Why is the WordPerfect unable to remove a simple bug in its Multinational Characters set? This set contains two characters, #1,206 and #1,207 (letters ""Z"" and ""z"" with a diacritical sign called hachek). These characters do not display on screen and do not print. If one needs to produce a serious text which requires these characters, one can forget about WordPerfect.This bug sneaked into one of the earlier editions of WordPerfect. It was fixed in the SP3 of WordPerfect 9 and I thought that this solved the problem.But the bug was re-introduced into WordPerfect 10, survived all its upgrades and merrily migrated to the most recent WordPerfect 11, including the latest update (WP11 00300). So much for progress.Such a fault is unacceptable in a serious software, especially one that has the word ""Perfect"" in its name."

64004,2,After upgrading to QB Pro 2007 we found certain sections to be completely unusable & would lock up our system when we tried to use them.Over the course of almost two weeks we repeatedly tried to contact support. The first time we called a tech walked us through a couple of things over the course of about 45 minutes before we got cut off.When we called back there was no record of us calling and no case#. After speaking with someone in India for nearly an hour and a half he said we would have to call back in a few days. I told him that was unacceptable and that I needed to speak with a manager. He put me on hold for 10 minutes and then came back & told me all the managers were on break and that I would have to call back later. He then refused to give me his name. After several minutes he finally told me in his thick accent that I could just call him Carl. I then had to practically beg him to create a case#. He gave me one but there was no record of it when I called back.A couple of days later I called back & spoke with Ruel. After going through all them same runaround I had been through twice already he told me he needed to check on a few things and that he would call me back in an hour. I never heard from him.A few days after that it was Manish. He told me he could not access any data at that time and that he would call back the next day at 10:30am. I never heard from him.I then called the next day and asked to speak to a manager. The person put me on hold for 22 minutes before I ended up with a dial tone.The next day it was the same thing accept this time I waited for 26 minutes before I got a dial tone.I have tried to go to their website & complain but there is no place to do so. We are now actively looking for another solution besides Quickbooks for our accounting and do not plan to use Quickbooks any longer.
70070,1,I've used this dvd player and it works great and has a lots of codecs for the price I did not have to upgrade and for the price it can't be beat since the newer ones are so expensive and loaded with options that I never used I wanted a cheap simple player that would just work with my old Windows 2000 pro system and it never failed me. Good deal and would reccomend for those who need a player without a load of stuff you will vever use anyway
75584,0,"I am a professional Graphic Designer, with a degree in Fine Arts & Graphic Design. I am sure most people who would pay for Adobe Photoshop (or any of the Adobe Suite Programs) are designers/artists.I have been using Adobe CS3 (mostly Photoshop, Illustrator & InDesign) for the past 4 months or so. I have been using Photoshop itself, since version 4.In a sentence, Photoshop CS3 is good, but if you already are using CS2, there is no real reason to upgrade.The added features are OK, but not worth paying for really and I have had stability issues with this newer version of Photoshop that I have not had in CS2. The two most annoying problems are: If I have a non-postscript printer set as a default, Photoshop will ALWAYS crash when I open a 2nd document (blank or otherwise). The other issue (which is also shared with InDesign) is that if I have been using Photoshop for a few hours, and switching between programs, Photoshop will vanish. It will not show up in my taskbar (WinXP SP2) nor in the running apps list in Task Manager. I need to terminate the process from the Task Manager process window, and then restart of course losing all unsaved edits.I do not have these issues with Photoshop CS2.Also the installation process was a real pain in the neck. It was much longer (about 25 minutes) than previous versions of Photoshop. It took me 4 days (almost 30 hours altogether) to get the suite installed on my laptop due to the activation process freezing after I entered my software key. I also had to uninstall all of my CS2 programs before I could get CS3 installed. I also needed to download Adobe's CS3 ""Cleaner"" utility and run it several times. It was not worth the trouble, especially considering how much I paid for the software.Once I got it installed it worked fine (aside from the two bugs listed above). I was able to reinstall CS2 as well.Like I said earlier the new features are just OK, not worth the trouble I went through with installation. Also the new palette system is kind of annoying. When I work I am constantly going back and forth between palettes making adjustments. The new palette dock minimizes them to a button, but you cannot have 2 open at the same time using this system. When you open one palette, the one you were previously working on closes. You can float them, but then that doesn't take advantage of the improvements of CS3. In my case I just ended up using the ""legacy"" pallette set up, which made my palettes work the way they did in CS2.Adobe Photoshop is the ""standard"" for photo editing software, but the hard install, high price and lack of any really useful new features makes it hard to recommend this version of Photoshop over previous versions which installed easier and work faster with less resources."

As for using scanners, color printers, and digital cameras... it's all covered. Twain interfaces are standard, and the corrections you repeatively do can be built into automatic procedures.

7355,0,"I was excited about the possibility of having integration between Outlook and my accounting package so I downloaded the trail for SBA from Microsoft and gave it a try. Since own but was not using the Business Contact Manager add on to Outlook my first chore was get in working. This proved to be a huge chore with several failed attempts and a 1:40 call to MS tech support to find out I needed to download an updated version of the BCM software. After some trouble I finally got everything working and began to explore SBA 2006.As a current user of QuickBooks 04 Pro I was able to import my company data fairly easy. There are some oddities about how your finical data transfers and several transactions that had a unique identity in QB like an invoice or deposit now just look like a journal entry. There may some work around, but I have not found it. All of my client data transferred easily, and I was able to move that to Outlook with BCM quite easily.I primarily use QB to invoice clients and then receive payments on those invoices and make deposits. With QB it was vary easy to create separate forms for different situations and instruct QB to print one type of Invoice for one client and a different type for another. With SBA MS claims you can customize forms, but it's much trickier than they let on. To customize a form you must make a form template in Word and to print that form you have to tell SBA to export the item (say an Invoice) to Word for printing. Although the form customization possibilities seem limitless, the implementation of actually using them seems far too cumbersome. With QB I can batch print Invoices using my customized forms easily and I can't find a way to make this work in SBA at all. With SBA it looks like you have two default form choices for invoices (product and services) with no way to modify them.The other thing I do constantly is receive payments and print deposit slips. With QB I simply place my preprinted deposited slip in the print and its' formatted and printed correctly. The deposit slip form that SBA produces dose not match my pre-printed deposit ticket and I cant find any option to change it.Additionally, when I entered a deposit and then had to re-locate it, it was a somewhat more difficult process than in QuickBooks. With QB I can simply enter the deposit screen and page back to previous entries but this was not possible with SBA.With all that said, I love having customer financial data available in Outlook. If a client calls I can easily look at her account status while accessing her information in outlook. There is also a huge amount of duplicate entry that might be avoided by sharing a singe database for accounting and CRM data. I also love how easily SBA will pass information to Excel or other MS software for manipulation and analysis.I am frustrated with QB's pricing and in program spamvertising, but I think at this point it is still a more mature and flexible program. Its disappointing that an upgrade for QB (which is actually no longer offered forcing current customers to buy new again) is higher priced than buying SBA. If you image is not dependant on the output of your accounting program and you only use it internally, then you might be happy with SBA, but if you need document flexibility I think you will find it inappropriate. I so much wanted to like SBA, but its just missing too much now to consider switching."

26250,1,"Windows XP in all varieties is great. Its clean and neat. It updates drivers almost by itself if they are needed during installation. It will detect most plug and play hardware such as External USB drives. (ie: scanners MP3 players, printers..and the like.)If you want it to work properly you need to install the Microsoft updates at least once a week. It is not necessarily Microsoft having flaws that you need to update that often. Its people with too much time on their hands creating hacks and trying to get what you got on your machine. Who would dream that people can be so malicious? Secondly as with any machine and Windows Xp you have to clean and defragment your hard drive or it will slow down and not run right. If you surf sites that have losts of video and the like when you view it, it gets stored on your hard drive whether you know it or not. This is why you run defrag and clean your machine by clicking on ""my computer,""...when it shows you all the drives right click my computer, then go to properties and run disk clean up.

348,1,I refreshed a users computer to an i7 processor and 64 bit Windows 7. User has a Lotus Approach application that is a business requirement. The version I installed on the 32 bit XP machine would not install on the 64 bit Windows 7 machine. With nothing to loose and everything to gain I ordered the 9.8.2 version of Lotus Smart Suite. It arrived in a few days and it installs with no problems and runs the database without any problems.

71557,1,Popcorn has done everything I expected it to do. It's as simple as it gets and almost all my dvd's have worked. A couple haven't but that's not because of popcorn. I would recommned this over any other DVD compressor/burner.
21541,0,"Your mileage may vary, but in my experience this product is NOT the complete dog that the other reviews point to. I'm running it on a laptop with Vista Home Premium. Once I figured out that you have to have hard drive access enabled on your iPod (a setting in iTunes)it works like a charm.I successfully cloned ~3000 songs from a 30gb iPod Classic to a new 8gb iPod Nano. I like the ability to edit properties of the songs, delete duplicates, etc.The interface is only adequate, not great, and the help a little skimpy - but its only 19.95 and it does extend greater flexibility in managing single & multiple iPods."
5112,2,"You can summarize the newest Norton 2004 products with these words: bulky, slow, bloatware, and activation hassles.The Norton 2003 Antivirus and System Works products have worked very well for me and Norton Antivirus has been known to be the premium antivirus solution for computers for many years. If you have the latest updates Norton 2003 is almost the same as Norton 2004 but there is no activation requirement for version 2003. Also, the newer 2004 versions have a few extra features that are suppose to enhance antivirus protection but the software just tries to do way too much.The result of the bloatware is a huge program running constantly in the background, soaking up your computer resources and slowing your system to a crawl. Then there is the hassle of the required activation along with its annoyances and you may wonder if this &quot;new 2004 version&quot; is worth it.I have concluded that Norton AV 2004 is absolutely NOT worth it and instead recommend you find a copy of Norton 2003 Antivirus or System Works Pro. Many online sites sell version 2003 OEM copies for around $20 or less and this version will allow for one year of free updates from the time of your installation. Install a copy of Zone Alarm Pro 4.0 or 4.5 if you want added firewall protection with pop-up blocking and enhanced privacy while web surfing and you have yourself excellent overall protection and acceptable system speed for most newer computers.An excellent option for those older systems or if you want more efficient protection without bogging down you computer speed is using the new McAfee Antivirus 2004 version with the option of also using Zone Alarm Pro 4.0 or 4.5 . I have found this to be a really fast solution to my slower notebook computer. Norton System Works and Antivirus 2003 updates had made my notebook (Pentium 3 1Ghz w/256k RAM) almost non-working because of its impact on system speed. Uninstalling Norton System Works 2003 and installing McAfee Antivirus 2004 allowed my computer run at least twice as fast. The only drawback to using McAfee was that you have to shut down the Zone Alarm Pro firewall temporarily to do the occasional McAfee AV program updates (not necessary for just the virus definition updates). The pop-up blocker in Zone Alarm effects the browser required web site update feature of McAfee. However the antivirus definitions for both McAfee AV and Norton AV can be allowed to fully update automatically if you allow full program access in the Zone Alarm Pro program firewall configuration.In summary your solutions are Norton 2003 Antivirus or the more efficient McAfee 2004 Antivirus. Either program combined with Zone Alarm Pro 4.0 or 4.5 provides excellent overall protection and privacy. If you have a newer or faster system (at least 1.5 Ghz CPU and at least 512k RAM ) then for sure go with Norton 2003. If you are running a slower computer with less memory then use McAfee 2004."
35444,0,I bought this at a local store and was lucky in some sense that I already went through 5 years of written French in school (about 15 years ago). The CD will be difficult to use if you have absolutely no French background. Also while going through the audio CDs it would have been nice if you could see the actual spellings of what you were repeating. Other than that I believe it is ok. I gave it three stars but if I had no basic French linguistic skills I wouldnt give it more than 1.5 stars.
67911,1,"I love this Printmaster16 program. I find the current Printmaster (2011) so complicated and also too many images have to be bought. It's ridiculous seems like all the good stuff on the new one needs to be purchased and they want you to register etc with your credit card of course. I don't know maybe with more time I could get into the new ones but I'm too busy and this version meets my needs just fine. Very Simple. You know what they say,""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" I re-ordered this because I moved and misplaced one of the Cds. So I've bought this twice if that says anything. :)"
13318,1,System Mechanic 6 Professional is an excellent product and it solved all the problems I was having with my computer. It also alerts you of impending problems. I highly recommends this product.

64037,0,I bank with BOA and they provide there customers with account download information in the Windows Quicken format. There is no conversion mechanism in Quickbooks Pro Mac for this. It has conversion from Quickbooks Windows to Mac format and from Quicken Mac format to QuickBooks Mac but it doesn't have the functionality to convert from Quicken Windows to Quicken Mac or to Quickbooks Mac.I am disappointed that Intuit can not come up with a single format using XML as a standard that can be readable to all of it's software.I have not been able to check out other features of the product because I will either have to subscribe to a premium service from my bank to download my transactions directly from there server to the software or manually enter my account information.
57451,0,"I will kick-off by advising all those who currently use either the 2005 or 2004 version of this software to save their time and money. There is no compelling feature or improvement here, which warrants an upgrade. The overall interface remains unchanged; although minor tweaks can be seen here and there.However, if you are a first-time buyer; or you are the type of person who derives psychological satisfaction from having the 'latest software' at his or her disposal, then I will say: go ahead and please yourself. Afterall, the asking price for this software is only a fraction of what comparable suites retail for. It is a very capable utility suite. And despite its few shortcomings, it still worths every dime you invest on it.Note that the functional layout of this ""PC-Cillin Internet Security 2006"" bears more similarity to 'Norton' than 'McAfee'. It is dependable and remains efficient in the course of discharging its duties. Yet, that will not make me to shy away from the few problems, which you may likely encounter in the course of using the software.The first drawback is that the individual components of this application suite, will noticeably reduce the performance of your computer. Even with a machine which harbours a top-of-the-line processor as well as a generous amount of RAM, this operational redundancy will be apparent. Another problem is that booting-up your operating system will not only take eternity to complete, but the machine can just freeze in the process; thus, forcing you to manually switch it off in order to start everything afresh. This could be both annoying and frustrating: especially, if you are experiencing crunch-time and needed to do something quickly. But, the good news is that the problem becomes alleviated if you can only make-out the necessary time and defragment your hard-disk. In my own case, doing just this has reduced the problem by more than ninety percent. It has not disappeared completely; but it rarely occurs.In summary, I will testify that ""PC-Cillin Internet Security 2006"" provides impressive antiviral and firewall capabilities; though, it lacks the finesse of wizard-driven suites like 'Norton' and 'McAfee'. Still, almost all experienced users of Internet Security suites do not need the assistance of wizards to achieve excellent configurations. Wizard's greatest impact is on the very beginners and the inexperienced. Experienced users hardly make use of it. Again, do remember that the price of this item is a very big PLUS, when compared to either 'McAfee' or 'Norton'. And, bear in mind that it favorably competes with both suites in terms of both performance and compatibility. There is literally no functional attribute that either 'Norton' or 'McAfee' possess, which you cannot find in this ""PC-Cillin Internet Security"" suite. This software package is by every means, a hard-to-resist choice in terms of both price and quality. And if the current productive standard is maintained, I look forward to seeing it improve as future editions emerge."

It does take patience and determination to fully learn how to use it, I am about 50% of the way there after a month. The video demonstrations are very good I would ask for the number of these to be increased to cover all the common tricky tasks. One or two 3D errors that I am working out how to correct and may be my lack of knowledge rather then the package. Will report back in a number of months."

10871,1,"This is a terrific package of toddler software, featuring one disc of Winnie the Pooh Toddler and one disc of Mickey Mouse Toddler. Activities are inherently interesting to children -- colorful, musical problem solving and play -- and generally have three difficulty levels in order to customize the experience.In Winnie the Pooh, each activity (involving letter recognition, sorting, counting, music, sequence completion and painting) occurs in one of the main characters' houses, and children use a navigation screen showing all the houses situated in 100 Acre Wood. As each activity is completed, that character is free to attend Eeyore's birthday party. When all of the activities are completed, your child can attend the party and watch the story ending. This kind of cohesive play is sorely missing from most kids' software.In Mickey Mouse Preschool, the navigation screen is set at a diner and gas station run by Goofy. Activities include music, design, arcade shooting, following directions, opposites and games. Most are car-oriented, which is especially fun to many children. While this game doesn't have an overarching goal like that in the Winnie the Pooh game, it is lively and fun.The two discs make a terrific combination for your 2- to 4-year old. Highly recommended."

12717,0,"Let me begin by describing my computer set-up. Athlon 1.0 processor, 356 meg RAM, etc.I installed XP last evening on my computer, and have spent a lot of time since then downloading upgrades for my computer. Adaptec Easy CD Creator 4.0 does not run with XP. You can purchase AECC 5.0 for $(dollar amount), but even then you have to wait for the free download of 5.1 (not yet available) before you can use your burner. I use my burner daily and was not ready for such a delay. Other than that, this edition is fine. The visual package is pleasing, very user-friendly and more organized than ME or 98.Time will tell more for me, but I am not sure that the upgrade is worth it. Buy a machine designed especially designed for XP. Windows ME was fine for me, and you might find the same true for you."

94443,1,"Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen outdo themselves in ""The Magic School Bus: Inside the Human Body."" It is their most ambitious collaboration yet, and it definitely doesn't disappoint.As is the custom, the third book in this science series (written in 1989) picks up where the second story left off. Ms. Frizzle is showing her students a filmstrip about the human body. ""We're going to learn all about ourselves,"" she says. Then she announces the next field trip - the class is heading to the museum to ""see an exhibit about how our bodies get energy from the food we eat."" However, anyone who has even an inkling as to the kind of person Ms. Frizzle is should know that things rarely, if ever, go according to plan. A field trip is never just a field trip when you're taking a ride aboard her magic school bus.The Friz and her students stop at a park for lunch before arriving at the museum. Afterward, everyone goes back to the bus . . . except for Arnold! He's still sitting at a picnic table, daydreaming and eating a bag of Cheesie-Weesies. And before the class realizes what is happening, the bus shrinks to the size of a Cheesie-Weesie . . . where it is promptly downed in one gulp by Arnold!""I thought we were going to the museum,"" says one student.""There's been a slight change of plans,"" explains Ms. Frizzle. ""We're being digested instead.""Why visit an exhibit about the human body when you have a magic school bus and a teacher like Ms. Frizzle who can take you directly to the source?If ""At the Waterworks"" was like priming the pump, and ""Inside the Earth"" was like getting the ball rolling, ""Inside the Human Body"" is like plowing full-steam ahead. Cole and Degen have firmly established themselves as a literacy force to be reckoned with; this is proven in the confidence of the writing and the boldness of the illustrations. There is so much going on in this story that you almost need a scorecard to keep track of it all. It seems as though Cole and Degen are bound and determined to one-up themselves with every book they come out with.A list of some things Ms. Frizzle educates her class about would include: blood cells (red and white), blood vessels, digestion, germs, the heart, lungs, molecules, oxygen, plasma, the small intestine, etc. Do you know what villi are? You will after you read this book! Any idea what the cerebral cortex does? Ms. Frizzle will show you! Ever wondered why you sneeze? The answer resides in this story!""Inside the Human Body"" deserves just as much, if not more, a home on a person's bookshelf as does ""At the Waterworks"" and ""Inside the Earth."" Cole and Degen loaded their latest adventure to the bursting-point with information. You can see the growth author and illustrator have taken since their inaugural effort with ""At the Waterworks."" They prove that some things do, indeed, get better with age.At the end of ""Inside the Human Body"" is a true-false test to help readers distinguish what things were true in the story and what things were made up. And, of course, Ms. Frizzle drops another clue as to where her next great adventure will take us. I'm pretty sure the class will think of their next field trip as out of this world!It doesn't seem possible, but Cole and Degen managed to improve upon an already-winning formula. They are both in top form with ""Inside the Human Body,"" a field trip that will take you from the brain to the small intestine and back again. Well, what are you waiting for? Hitch a ride on the magic school bus!As Ms. Frizzle herself would say, ""Seatbelts, everyone!"""
37576,0,"I installed the product, but it didn't work. Everything was disabled and the product did not seem installed properly. It would not complete a system scan, and I got error messages.After attempting to get help from Mcafee without success, I just uninstalled the product and started all over.

If you think you can solve your own support issues, then go for it."
62183,0,"My kids love this game. The action is constant, although on some games it doesn't give them enough time to figure it out without prompting for some kind of action. The main problem I had was installing it onto my Windows 2000 Pro system. I lost my hard drive, and I have to blame the software because I tried it with a fresh system, and it did the exact same thing. So, I would say buy this only if you have a Windows 95/98/ME system, but not a Windows 2000 system. Hopefully, Windows XP will be able to handle it."

53012,0,"I bought this program for my little cousin in hopes that his math skills would improve for college. The program is put together pretty well, however, it is not much for making the subject fun. I purchased this program in hopes that he would be able to interact and enjoy math a little more but unfortunately it failed him in that area. I felt as if he might as well have just read a textbook instead. The good thing about this software is that it does a good job helping you plan goals. Also the tests that are provided give you good practice, but overall, it can be pretty boring. It really does give good explainations on how to do a certain math function; I just wish it was a little more fun."
11822,1,"My son's daycare has the Putt Putt games and the kids love them so much that they end up in tears over who gets to play them for 5 minutes a turn. The game is very cute and simple; non-aggressive and lots of little actions that are amusing.I got a used copy on Amazon for use on my machine at home that runs XP, which was supposed to run it (from what I read). However, there was no sound, even in compatibility mode, which was a big problem for this particular game.After a lot of searching and experimenting I got it to work great using ScummVM (an open-source freeware app that you can find online.) If you're technically inclined it will be no problem to get that going. However, if you're not technically inclined but want to try, I wrote a step-by-step description of how I did it. (Just search Google under ""doctorlizardo putt putt"" and you'll find it). Hopes this helps another parent."
76863,1,"Like many other reviews, I will say that this chip is necessary if you are driving in Italy. We drove from the center of Rome to Venice, but during our travels we spent 3-4 days driving in and around Tuscany. Not quite as accurate as the US chip, but still got us by. A fair amount of random ""recalculating"" occurred even thou we were on the road we were suppose to be on. And we got lead on at least one 30 minute detour. We had some serious troubles in Certaldo but it maybe wasn't the chips fault since many of the roads were brand new as in they were just opened a week prior to our arrival... but it really got us lost quite a few times since it was in-route to our hotel everyday in Toscany."
50508,1,"This game is definatly better than the first one. You can choose to play a real team, or, the always availible backyard logos. Now you can pick real players(some have retired by now though) or the talented backyard kids.When you play the easy mode, it's easy! My cousin has won 50 to 0! The medium level is a bit more challenging. You still win pretty easily, but I've got myself cought in a couple of games that are still too hard. The hard is HARD, well not too hard. The scores are now like baseball scores. Not 32 to 4, but 3 to 4 and so on.Well I think it's a great game. Ready to be played by children of all ages. Just say thanks to Humonguous, the pro players, and the backyard kids for all this fun. I also recommend Bakyard Football, Soccer, and Basketball."

54727,0,"I never used any other label maker so I cannot compare it. I found it simple yet it has 1 serious limitation: its inability to create very small text. Labels are frequently small. I never imagined that a label maker would not include a mechanism by which you can insert tiny text. I cannot add ""external use only"" or ""5ml"" to my label without it being as large as any of the other writing on it. This product is therefore not a complete solution for me to make my labels."
65729,1,"The reader reads this Mercer Mayer classic at a very slow pace. There are some cute surprises as the child clicks on parts of the drawings (mailbox opens, birds flutter etc.) and there is a limited sand castle building component among the choices, but I found the CD to be relatively slow as compared to other early learning CD's. The surprise was my grand daughter's reaction. This was one of her most frequently chosen items when we sat down to the computer together. Now 4 and more interrested in her alphabet and skills, the CD sits unchosen but it was probably her favorite at ages 2 and 3!Update... We've passed it on to a great nephew who is now sharing it with HIS Grandma!Further Update! I'd NEVER spend current price of $35 for it... It's a $10 value item."
68675,1,"While this program does have very good help files, you probably won't need them. This is the way all programs should be. With minimum effort, you can achieve impressive results.This is a good program for people that want to put their pictures into projects like cards, calendars, posters, signs, stickers, labels, newsletters, invitations, certificates, T-shirts, Flyers and more. It's quick and easy. The on-screen layout is simple and straight forward. Great for kids (and their grandparents)."

It might be better and feel that it will be BUT it will take getting used to. There is a learning curve, as with all software. I am a big Word and Excel user. All of my documents and spreadsheets ported over w/o problems. There are many, many more options and functions that will increase productivity and presentation as they are mastered. It is a very easy install, on a clean PC. If you have Office installed, I would remove it first or purchase the upgrade version. This should make installing updates easier.Overall, I am happy with this version and the additional functions."
3134,1,"I have tried a variety of language software titles to learn to speak French and I was beginning to get rather frustrated. After several months, I was still unable to put together coherent sentences. That's pretty sad, considering I've taught English to a variety of ages for 4 years and have a strong grasp on sentence structure. However, there's good news! Within a few lessons, I was putting together ideas with Rosetta Stones' French tutorials. The program uses photographs to piecemeal together ideas. You feel much like a child exploring the world in a new language and you will find yourself thinking in French in no time! In addition, you don't have to sit through boring grammar lessons, it just comes naturally. I highly recommend this product, even though it is considerably more expensive than some of the others, it is well worth the price of admission."
2051,1,"With the creation of Windows 95 operating systems for the Intel platform pc's were brought into the new millennium of software. With Windows 98 more advancements were created and now with Windows ME we have the added the ability to have and operating system and online platform roiled neatly into one package.While this software operating system is made for the home, I have it installed at work for testing purposes. The installation was quicker than 98 and 98 SE but only by a few minutes. I found that the package was far more robust in its ability to be web centric and allow for greater online gaming.While the average user will be hard pressed to find real differences from 95 and 98 there are a few new features included, most notably is the Movie Maker. Also I found the wizards to more intuitive and easy to use.A couple of other things included are the ability to sign up for MSN and Hotmail after the completion of the install. The newest addition is Ask Maxwell, which is a free internet service to provide the user with online help.Overall the product has been running for 12 Days without one blue screen of death or illegal operation, Microsoft has a real winner on their hands with Windows ME."

But I love him anyway, and we're becoming dear friends.In fact, my husband is so intrigued by this new relationship, that I've decided to buy him his very own Charlie, for his birthday coming up soon.

It gives you the option to print to a PDF File that can then be stored in My Documents, for example. Since I started using this product my paper and printing costs have been greatly reduced.PDF files can also be converted to Word, edited, then resaved as a PDF file. This is great for sending files attached to e-mail in a way that they can not turn around and edit the files for their benefit. The password protection is a great feature for security reasons. I also regularly print web pages to PDF using this program then store them in My Documents for future reference.I highly recommend this product!"

72304,0,"I'm a financial planner who deals with estate planning issues all the time (though I'm not an attorney). To clarify the two previously posted reviews, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A JOINT WILL.A will is a document that reflects an individual's desires as to what should happen to their assets when they die, among other things. The person from IL who wrote about joint assets needs to understand that no matter what their wills say, joint assets pass to the surviving owner upon death of the other party.Lots of people are unclear on this point.Anyway, I'm coming dangerously close to dispensing advice in a forum not intended for it, and I cannot make any claims pro or con about the software because I've never used it. The original scathing review is not, in and of itself, justified, however."

76862,1,"When I initially ordered this product I was skeptical that a micro-SD card could contain adequate navigation for Italy and Greece and in particular for Sicily which was our destination. I have to say that using this product allowed me to reach my destinations in half the time that would've taken otherwise. The roads in Sicily are relatively well marked that there are many roads that have signs stating ""detour"" without an explanation of how to navigate around the detour. Despite the fact that the roads are well marked they can become extremely confusing. This map and guide was right on the money and got me to my destinations very efficiently. It worked in all locales whether I was in a busy city like Palermo or out in the countryside. I must say that prior to my departure I was in contact with Garmin and they did warn me to turn off all of my other maps to avoid GPS confusion. Since I forgot to perform this last step upon arrival, my 1st excursion from the airport to the hotel was faulty. After I turned off the other maps as instructed, the system worked flawlessly."

47790,0,"I am something of an OCR fanatic because I depend a lot on being able to digitize research material for compact storage and easy access. I began some years ago with TextBridge and looked forward to seeing what Scansoft had done in melding the features of TextBridge and OmniPage. The result was a big disappointment. The ability to make PDFs in one step is a major improvement but they &quot;lost&quot; one the features that I find most important -- automatic separation of a scan of two pages at once from a book into separate scan pages. And the recognition accuracy and flexibility doesn't even come close to the standards set by ABBYY FineReader 5.0 (or even the earlier versions of FR!).The one significant advantage of OP over FR is its ability to accept PDF files directly as inputs. Unless that is of overwhelming importance to you and your needs for recognition of complex material are modest, I would definitely skip OmniPage and get FineReader instead -- and save a bundle of money in the process."
28479,1,This is one of the coolest games you will ever play. It's like a board game but everywhere you land there's a different game. Lots of the games are freak out scary like the movie. You have to fix a fence before a raptor catches up and kills you! You have to sneak past a T-rex and if you don't make it you get eaten alive! The dinosaurs are totally realistic. And the dueling dinosaurs game RULES!

Most of the vocabulary is only useful on a vacation or business trip, not conversational spanish. Aside from that, the program worked nicely (I have Windows XP), with some beautiful videos of spanish-speaking nations."
15899,1,"I've been an editor for 10 years, but I steared clear of trying out Final Cut Pro until I was turned down for my 3rd job in a row (because it required using FCP). It's becoming more of a standard than Avid, I would argue - and if you've tried it out, you know that it's not the easiest program to learn. Anyway this DVD was exactly what I needed. The early lessons review everything you need to know about the system - and the later lessons really focus on the professional features. And you don't have to lose a whole weekend in a stupid overpriced workshop b/c the training DVD is well-paced and covers everything essential to editing in just 4 hours.Very cool project files let you work alongside the instructor. And Zak (the teacher) gives you insights into the craft of editing as well --which is way beyond what most software training covers. I love this program and the whole series, and would highly recommend it to others."

If you are a newbee Windows type of person I would seriously consider Red Hat Professional. Why spend all evening cussing your computer? The only other Linux edition I would consider is Xandros. I haven't tried it yet, but Xandros is the follow on to the old Corel Second Edition of Linux which was a great piece of work."

15783,1,"the product was wonderful! but whoever shipped it...REALLY screwed up. I ordered the item december 9th, using shipping that was supposed to only take 4-14 days - SUPER SAVER SHIPPING - when did it come? JANUARY 6th! ONE MONTH LATER. AFTER CHRISTMAS. LONG AFTER THE SURPRISE OF THE HOLIDAYS. I tracked the shipping, it said it started out in bell, california, very close to where i live, then it went to MARYLAND - why? i have no idea - then it came back to Bell, California, sat around for 6 days, and after 3 complaint emails with only one response (which was to monitor my tracking and let them know if it didnt come in a couple of days, which i did and they didnt seem to want to respond then) it finally showed up at my house...11 days later than the LAST SHIPPING DAY.i will say this once: NEVER AGAIN."

Quality service &amp; low prices at Amazon are certainly 'UNMATCHED'. I would stick to Amazon for future purchases &amp; recommend same to other serious buyers."
78653,1,"Excellent product. My only complaint concerns shipping. Specifically Amazon would not allow me to include my PO box in any form as part of my address. My PO Box is where I receive mail, not my house. It was returned to you as undeliverable, then you resent it UPS/FedX. Thanks for resending it, however it would have been a lot cheaper for you if Amazon would just let me list my Box # on line 2."

71877,1,"This is one of the best childrens games I've come across, and let me tell you - I have A LOT of them (over 50) and this is by far my children's favorite not to mention mine.... for multiple reasons. For the kids, it has fun songs, great game parts, there are so many different places to go and things to do that they don't get tired of it! Why I love it - it has wonderful nature facts about TONS of different animals and not just ""A deer is a mammal"" they really go in depth about things that childrens software just does not normally do! It's so refreshing to see! Your children can actually LEARN a lot from this software and have a ton of fun at the same time! Even my 2 year old LOVES this game...his sister helps him navigate, but he loves to watch with her! I would have given this software more than 5 stars if I could! Buy buy buy!!"
13342,0,"This was a great way with rebates to get Kaspersky AV & a Kaspersky Firewall bundled.That's was the GREAT PART. The bad part... I had to go through & reset every scan / option to not do anything automatically.

5771,1,"I can't really compare this software to others, but I can say that it did a pretty good job for me. Just spend about 20 minutes answering questions in the beginning, and it will do most of the rest. My tax return consisted of several jobs for both my wife and I, working in two different states, mutual fund and stock purchases and sales, interest and capital gains income, and a mortgage. I thought this would make my return to complicated for a comuter software, but everything I needed was here. Nad if for some reason you don't like what it does, you can manually change any entry. However, if you manually change entries, you will not be allowed to e-file.I installed this on my desktop, and again on my laptop to do some work when my wife was working on the desktop. This worked fine. But there is no clear way of letting one computer know what you did on another computer, so multiple installations are for the most part useless.The one thing I don't like is that it seemed like procrastinators are rewarded for their laziness in that this software gets cheaper the nearer you get to April 15th, to the point where it become free after rebate."

Thumbnail table of pictures is fine, but when you click on one to bring it up for view, it gives the following error in Firefox:Firefox can't find the file at /C:/Documents and Settings/Me/My Documents/WebPages/PhotoAlbum1/%7.I generally like the program (as an experienced computer user, but one who only creates web pages occasionally and doesn't want a more powerful tool), but if they can't make it work with Firefox as well as IE, I may have to go elsewhere...Word of advise - download their trial version, ceate some web pages, and then try using IE and Firefox to view them before buying the full product..."

The only problem we have is that the program sometimes hangs up and won't continue. The session has to be paused and re-started, which is frustrating. Sometimes this doesn't fix the problem, however, and the session has to be ended, then re-started. We haven't found a sure-fire way to stop it from hanging up."

73801,1,"These games are very fun because it's a game of strategy and a lot of work! I think you should play this game because it's fun going into caves to find pufferfish and gems and getting on different levels, which means getting different treasures. It's fun to go back and see your treasures any time you want. And I like listening to the music and trying to avoid the gobberfish."

34724,1,"This software works and it works well. It is a tad annoying that the software keeps asking if you want to upgrade before you get started with your return...It is as though the manufacturer is trying to tell you you made a mistake by going with Basic instead of Deluxe. But once you get rolling, the software holds your hand and it actually is pretty hard to make a mistake. We did our return in less than an hour. Compare that to trying to fill out the forms manually (maybe this can be accomplished in 10-14 hours!!!!). This is solid."

There are a few custom applications in our office that only run on Windows XP and Parallels lets me use them right along side my native Mac applications. It's stable, reliable, and easy to setup and use. It's even better than having a PC on my desk next to my Mac, because I can copy/paste info between applications!"
50673,1,"I've been using computers for 25 years, so I'm a bit jaded and not easily wowed. However, using Virtual PC 2004 has wowed me. I've stayed away from this kind of software in the past because I worried that it would run very slowly. I was wrong. I have now created two virtual machines, one Windows XP Pro and one Linux distro (PCLinuxOS) and I couldn't be happier. Not only can I run other operating systems without rebooting, but they run nearly as fast as normal. Even better, I can close them into a kind of hibernate mode so that the next time I start them up they are right where I was before. I have also set up the undo disk feature. With that, if I screw something up I can just decide to not save any changes to the virtual machine. So, if I get a virus it doesn't do any damage. If a software install trashes the system it doesn't do any real damage. Finally, I can access my host PC from the virtual PC to exchange files just as I would on a normal network. I highly recommend this software. Get the 45-day trial version first, and then I'll bet you buy a copy just like I did."
7946,1,"Mac OS X Leopard is a feat of software engineering and usability. Nowhere else will you find an operating system that can hide its advanced underpinnings beneath a gorgeous and intuitive user interface. Here are some of my favourite features:1. Screen SharingUnbelievably easy and fast. I've used Microsoft Remote Desktop, Chicken of the VNC, etc., but none compare to the simplicity of screen sharing in Leopard. Also, I am not sure how Apple has done it, but the speed of screen sharing is astounding over my Airport Extreme Base Station network.2. Time MachineI bought a third internal drive for my Mac Pro to use Time Machine. It is incredibly simple and useful. For example, it works not only with files, but also with e-mail. Much has been said about Apple's decision to pull network support from Time Machine (e.g., backing up to an Airport disk,) but those statements are not entirely true. You can back up over the network to any hard drive connected to another computer on the network. So, for example, I can back up my wife's Macbook to a 300 GB Firewire drive attached to my Mac Pro. Of course, it's not nearly as fast as a local connection, but it works. I suggest you complete the initial sync locally and then perform the updates over the network.3. StacksLeopard's most maligned feature is Stacks, a way of seeing specified folders fly out of your dock in a fan or grid. The primary complaint has been that users cannot drill down through subdirectories in Stacks. This is true; it is not possible right now. I don't know if Apple plans to change this, but for my purposes, it's absolutely fine, because I never used the Dock as a file manager. Instead, I find Stacks to be an incredible way of keeping clutter off my Desktop. It includes a Downloads folder that receives files from Mail and Safari. You can easily open the Stack for this folder and see what files you have downloaded; you can drag them to the Trash, open them, and delete them. You can expand a Stack to show the folder in the Finder, which essentially makes it a file launcher. Finally, contrary to what many have said, you can drag and drop into a Stack as though it were a regular Mac OS X spring-loaded folder. Doing so simply opens the folder in the Finder and you can continue there as you would have done in Tiger.4. SpacesSpaces is the new feature that gives users almost as many virtual desktops as they want. If I recall correctly, the whole concept was developed by a Mac developer a few years ago. Since then, many Mac and Windows applications have imitated the concept. In the case of Spaces, however, Apple has finally done it right. Spaces switch fast and remember application preferences perfectly. You can assign applications to one space or make them viewable on all spaces.Before I purchased Leopard, I had two displays attached to my Mac Pro. With the advent of Spaces, I am now down to one display, because I feel I don't need the second display. Spaces keeps my workspace organized and uncluttered.These are the primary features from which I have benefited. There is also a noticeable speed and responsiveness increase in Leopard, probably because it works with multi-core processors much better now. Thankfully, all new Macs come with dual-core processors, so everyone will benefit.You can see unbelievable polish and attention to detail in Leopard, as well. For example, when you add a new GMail IMAP account to Apple Mail, you will see a little link to GMail's help center appear at the bottom of your new account page. Also, when you download a file and try to expand it, Safari will tell you exactly when it was downloaded and give you a link to the site so you can make sure the file is safe before proceeding.It is this kind of detail that really sets Apple out from other companies. You will see it in Leopard and enjoy your computing experience thoroughly."
42446,1,"I am delighted to be able to just click a button to do manuevers that required all kinds of menus and different screens in the old program. So far, I have used both the Word and Excel programs and am impressed with how easy they are to use. I have to save most things in both the older format and the newer because most correspondents don't have the new program yet. But that is just a click of the mouse, so no problem. I also noticed in comparing the old and new saved programs, that the 2007 version uses less memory to save items."
66263,1,I don't know what people are complaining about. I have had no trouble at all using this. It has more cards than one could imagine. There's something for everyone.

42292,1,I recieved this exactly on the date that was estimated. Package was not damaged and program has worked great.I bought this in the time frame to upgrade to the 2010 version when it was available. There was no instructions sent how to do this when it became available. I was able to do an internet search and found the instruction and the upgrade was a breeze.
34040,1,"This game, as with most other Nancy Drew games, are fun and very intriguing. But the thing that was wrong with this game was the puzzles. I found, that in the begining of the game, the puzzles were so easy it wasn't even funny, but as the game progresed, the puzzles got near impossible to figure out. I'll admit, I used a walkthrough VERY often for them. Also, toward the end of the game, there are a lot of riddles that you have to figure out and I am not good at riddles! If it wasn't for the walkthrough, I would never have been able to complete this game. Also, I knew who the culprit was basically from the begining of the game. To me, that part of the ""mystery"" was way to obvious.Overall, I had lots of fun playing this, it bothered me a little that I had to use the walkthrough so much but hey, I find myself doing that a lot with mystery games because of the puzzles. That is my main complaint about mystery games in general.Anyway, the storyline was intriguing and like I said I actually did have a blast playing it. However, no desire to play it again. Yup, poor replay value.I still reccomend this game to mystery fans.. but if you are new to mystery games, I'd start out with something else like some of Nancy's earlier games."
14903,0,"We love Madeline and and have enjoyed this software somewhat. It has good activities and such, just a few flaws. There is very annoying background music, its a little too loud and makes it hard to hear what is being said. And then there is a second set of music, like when something happens or she goes from one room to the next. It gives me a headache, but the kids don't seem to mind so much."
60761,1,"I have a barely 2 year old and a 4.5 year old.Ready for School Toddler: With the exception of the rational (as opposed to rote) counting skills and letter recognition, the content of these games is elementary even for my 2 year old. The advantage is that she can focus on learning to use the mouse in a way that will provide her with a lot of encouragement because she knows the answers. The two remaining sections will continue to offer her some educational value when she's more comfortable at the computer. There are two difficulty levels for each activity.Discovery Airport: Though the activities are somewhat elementary for him, my 4.5 year old loves to play this game because of the theme. The advantage of this game is that there are three difficulty levels, which make it educationally suitable for 2.5 to 4 year olds.Discovery Farm. Like the Airport game, content is better for 2 - 4 year olds.All in all a great set for younger children."
57263,1,"Maptech produces the best mapping software I've ever used. I've tried the rest, now I stick with the best. Being a Geography major in college, and working in the mapping industry now, I've used all the others, but maptech is by far the best. Detailed topos, great overlays, outstanding GPS hookup, and the 3-D graphics are unbelieveable!!!!! For anyone in a mapping field, or anyone looking to spice up their outdoor adventures, you have got to get this software."

55706,0,"My kids and I have been using this software for over a month. I have it connected to a MIDI piano.This software allows up to five students to keep track of their progress. One can choose any lesson to start and may switch among different lessons. The software remembers prior progress and picks up where one left off.For each exercise, points are awarded for correct responses and deducted for incorrect responses. The exercises become harder with higher scores and easier again as the score drops down because of wrong answers. This progressive instruction is very nice.I found the accompanying book to be very helpful, as I had no prior theory training.However, the software has limitations:The biggest problem is that it requires the user to strictly follow the lesson format. You only get one shot at playing intervals, for example. I like to learn by repeating the item several times before advancing to the next, to reinforce the sound and the relationship with the name. Trying to repeat the last item results in a wrong answer on the next item.This strict approach also limits exploration and frustrates kids. My kids, ages 10 and 8, don't really like the program and rarely spontaneously use it. My kids really like to learn other stuff on the computer. I would recommend this for kids over the age of 14.Finally, the lack of keyboard or even MIDI-mediated commands neccessitate constantly moving one's hands from the MIDI keyboard to the mouse, moving the pointer to the right icon and clicking. The mouse should not be necessary to work this program that keyboard oriented.I did contact tech support for one problem. I sent an email on Sunday afternoon and got a response about an hour later! I thought this was great."
91317,1,"Having tried them all, I can safely say that Art Explosion's &quot;Greeting Card Deluxe, Version 3&quot; is far and away the best program if it's kind. You might expect &quot;Hallmark&quot; or Broderbund's &quot;American Greetings&quot; to offer higher quality templates but surprisingly this is doesn't seem to be the case. For the most part, Art Explosion's graphics and layouts are the closest to what you would expect to find in a good card shop. With over 15,000 cards and 5000+ sentiments you're sure to find something appropriate for any occassion. Additionally, users looking for some added value will find a nice assortment of craft related &quot;project&quot; templates and a &quot;Video CD Greeting Card&quot; creator.The application launches quickly and the much improved program interface and &quot;double sided print wizard&quot; are intuitive and user friendly for young and old alike. Even those with limited computer or graphics experience can reasonably expect to produce high quality greeting cards within minutes of installing the program. Those who wish to customize their projects to a greater degree will appreciate the rich assortment of easy to use editing tools, 80,000 additional graphics and 500+ font library. Although most users won't need it, Art Explosion has included a well illustrated 100+ page guide book in addition to the on-screen help file.As for possible negatives, the size of the application might be a bit too much for those with older computers. The &quot;compact&quot; installation (which requires the user to insert content discs while creating cards) checks in at near 600mb while the full monty (certainly the most convenient) requires up to 1.2 gigs of drive space. There are no provisions for desktop publishing (newsletters, brochures, and the like) which is fine by me as such applications are better left to application specific programs such as Serif's &quot;Page Plus&quot; or &quot;MS Publisher&quot;. As the name would impliy, Greeting Card Factory is mostly about (you guessed it...) greeting cards (and PLENTY of them!). If that's what you're looking for, you're not likely to find a better program for the job."

A lot of the automation features work quite well for my purposes. Now I don't use this program for a club or in a bar or anything, just to do my radio show so i use the auto crossfade andmake my own playlists. Good stuff!

I'm amazed at even some of the tiniest streets it knows... there are a few streets that are not in the program but I've only found 2 so far. We also love that you can download it by regions of the state or country so you don't have to fill up your memory with useless info you won't need. User friendly... even showing bouy's in the bay when we go fishing and every state park is marked and easy to find!!!"
22498,0,"After seeing the other reviews, I was hesitant to buy. But the forced upgrade gave me no choice. I would have been happy to keep my Quicken Basic 1999. I use Quicken only for investment tracking. I had no installation problems, as others reported. It found and converted my old data. I was real happy that it asked if it wanted to uninstall Quicken 1999 for me, because I was afraid I would screw it up if I did it myself. Installation and conversion went flawless. It backs up to my CD-RW with fewer problems. Had to re-register to get on-line quotes. Don't like to give my address away. But on-line features work. Although a major investment firm I use does not participate in their downloads.Seen no bugs so far, but we'll see.Only giving 3 stars, due to forced upgrade. I assume they'll do that to us again someday."
45003,0,"The only reason to buy this package is to get WordPerfect. It is still far better than MS Word when it comes to creating fully-formatted and professional looking documents. (The rest of the package is sadly out-dated, poorly designed, and not worth the price.)If you use a wordprocessor as an advanced version of Notepad that automatically does various simple wordprocessor tasks (formatting, spelling, capitalization, outlining, tables, etc.) for you, definitely buy MS Word. But, if you care at all how your document looks, buy WordPerfect.The single most important feature that WordPerfect has (that MS Word does not have) is Reveal Codes. You can still go in, figure what is wrong with your formatting, and fix it in WordPerfect; the only way to handle bad formatting in MS Word is the old MS method of delete, try again, and hope the wordprocessor doesn't guess wrong yet another time about what I really wanted.Unfortunately, Corel has not figured out that they should dump the rest of the package, lower the price..., and focus on getting the bugs out of WordPerfect that make it somewhat unstable."

47009,1,"Short and sweet: works great, and as-advertised on my Mac from Tiger through Snow Leopard.I just updated my PC to Windows 7 and Huey fails to apply any adjustments at all. Completely incompatible with my graphics card (older ATI Radeon) although it worked fine with Vista. I just finished installing the ""Windows 7 Compatible"" HUEY drivers... didn't change a thing. Maybe you'll have better luck with later graphics cards, but be warned... Microsoft and Pantone are at it again.UPDATE: Bumping my review back up to 4 stars as the problem I was having does not appear to by Pantone's fault. Turns out a lot of graphics-related stuff stopped working with Windows 7. When I disabled the 5-year old Radeon and went back to the Intel on-board graphics, everything, including the Huey, worked as before. Microsoft and ATI apparently don't believe you should keep hardware longer than 5 years."
8064,1,"I've used Business Plan Pro several versions now, the key is that whether you're a pro or not, you have a lot to gain and nothing to lose by using this software. You get important built-in information now with the new version, plus a flexible outline and tons of content information, and complete financials that are solid and well-documented.Beginners can just follow the wizard to complete a plan without losing site of instructions and examples, and if you're more experienced, the new version has expanded the ability to add Excel-compatible worksheets. And the new manual is a great addition.It is backward compatible, by the way ... this version reads the previous version's files without problems ... and the previous version read the one before that without problems.If you want to do a business plan, use this, it's worth the price many times over."
4339,1,Adobe Premiere 6.5 is far from the most advanced non-linear video editing package you can get however let me make this one comment.- Editing is all about cutting and not fancy effects. The strength of the project is what is in front of and behind the camera not fancy effects.I would never recommend using any of the effects on any of the non-linear video editing packages anyway. Get dedicated effects packages if you really want to do your special effects well.In short Adobe Premiere is the BEST cutting software and the EASIEST to use. The learning curve is slightly steep but you will be cutting your footage within a day or two with this one.An editors cuts and arranges media. Adobe Premiere does that perfectly. I recommend this like no other but if you are looking for pro packages then go elsewhere and be prepared to pay five figures.
87692,2,"Don't waste your time or money on this Barbie CD - sloppy installation program, rough transistion between screens/pages, vocals badly out of synch, etc. An inferior product with little quality control.

41658,0,This software isn't perfect but it certainly served my purposes for getting holiday cards out this year. The database was easy to use. The help menus were good but sometimes did not match what was contained in the pull down menus. I loved the label and envelope templates but they all omitted the salutation field (Mr. Ms. etc.) and I had to make my own which took some practice and know how. For what I paid for this software it was just fine.

80713,1,"I have used this product for years, and many others. This one by far exceeds ease of use and comfort for study as opposed to quickverse, bible explorer, and many others which are good too because of the books that come with them, but as far as best overall i choose this one because of the strongs and referance system. all you have to do is install the strongs numbers and you can just click on the word from within the verse and the meaning of the word in greek or hebrew is shown at the lower right hand of the window, very intuitive to use, and you can easily do a search that appears in the window next to the passage, all very nice to look at. There are no clumsy pop up windows anywhere in this program. I hope they continue making this, and maybe even a more updated version, if mine gets tore up i hope i can still find it. the only thing that would make it better is to include some of the classic christian literature such as foxes, and pilgrims progress, and some select classic sermons."

62200,1,"I have 2 kids: 5 1/2 and 2 1/2. When my older daughter was very little, Reader Rabbit Toddler was wonderful for her. It is the only program I know of where kids can just move the mouse around and not have to click to make things happen. (Dragging and Clicking is very difficult for kids just starting out). She had hours of fun with it while her confidence and mouse skills were developing. It is very age appropriate for the youngest computer users. Of course by now, she is on to much more advanced CDs. My son, the younger one, is just now willing to sit still and try to do stuff on the computer and I can't find our Reader Rabbit Toddler CD anywhere!! So, I'm buying it again. I guess I must really like it."
45966,1,"I had previously used both StarOffice 5.2 (definitely *not* my favorite) and the beta release of 6.0 as well as Applix Office Suite (now Applix Anyware), Word Perfect, KWord, ABIword, and of course MS Office (under VMware on Linux). Overall I would rank SO 6.0 very favorably against its competition. I primarily use these products to do technical reports on Linux and Solaris, and while they all have their relative strengths, I would rank SO6.0 and Applix at the top of the pile.The installation was not difficult, and shortly after finishing the install I was able to open and work with documents in a variety of formats - Mac, MSWord, RTF, and html to start with - without *ever* seeing anything even approaching the well-known blue screen of death. The spreadsheet handled some fairly complex juggling without a whimper - including one scatterplot of several thousand data points. Overall, SO's feature set is fairly complete (although I *still* haven't been able to figure out how to maintain a uniform, specified row height on a table inserted into a text document), and I have found redesigned user interface to be sleeker and far less cumbersome than in SO5.2.On the down side, I *had* hoped it would be a free download from Sun ... sigh ... but I guess you can't have everything.On the plus side, I can now use the same app on Linux, Solaris (Sparc OR Intel), Win32 and just about every platform I have to use. Definitely recommended."
60746,2,"Don't you hate yourself when you buy something when you know you shouldn't? I was persuaded by someone to buy Final Cut Express and an iMac computer. I had already purshased and learned to use Sony Screenblaster video software on my PC, without much trouble, but I was persuaded I had to go Apple and Final Cut if I was going to be serious about making videos. The Final Cut Express that came with my iMac last June (2004) had a bug that I did not learn about until after months of working on a project. The bug causes the sound to get more and more unsynchronized the longer you work on it. Apple knew about this bug as early as last Feb. when they released a patch. I found out about the bug on my own, the hard way. The patch will not correct work already done.Learning to use FCE2 was extremely frustrating. Using it was not much fun. The results have been very disappointing. The iMac has not been much better. Crashes and glitches are no less than on PCs. Oh, yes, I could upgrade to Final Cut, and graduate from FCE2, for about $500. Only schoolteachers, their innocent students, and geeks could possibly think being trapped within Apple's proprietary world is cool."
20672,1,"I used this program for some time before a trip to Italy and it sucessfully taught me how to speak basic Italian pretty easily. I found the situational dialogues very useful in learning for my trip. They taught such things as how to order in a restuarant, get a hotel room, how to ask for directions ect. Italian Now has the ability to teach pronunciation with its adequete audio features. After my trip to Italy I continued to use the program and learned quite a bit more from it. This program is quite good for learning Italian even if its just for a trip or for learning another language in its entirety."

9747,0,"Love him or hate him, we video game fans need to tip our caps to director Paul Anderson. Regardless of whether you enjoyedResident Evil, he gave us our first decent game-to-movie outing when he pioneered ""Mortal Kombat"" - still considered by some to be the best adaptation of a video game, period. Indeed, ""Kombat"" came as a breath of fresh air after the stiflingly insipid attempts that wereSuper Mario Bros.andDouble Dragon, for not only did it follow the game's storyline to a degree that is unmatched even today, but it disproved the unfounded belief that a faithful adaptation of a game would be boring and unsuccessful. A recent viewing of the film allowed me to cast a slightly more humbled view upon it, but it still remains one of my favorite entries of the genre and ought to be standard viewing for any director about to tackle a game-related project.The story: when otherworldly forces led by an evil sorcerer (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa,The Last Emperor) threaten Earthrealm, mortal warriors are called upon by the god Rayden (Christopher Lambert,Highlander) to take part in the ancient tournament of Mortal Kombat to decide the fate of our world. At the heart of the resistance are Liu Kang (Robin Shou,Beverly Hills Ninja), Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby, ""The Young and the Restless""), and Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson,The Wedding Singer) - a young monk running from his destiny, a movie star looking to prove his legitimacy, and a special forces agent hunting a murderer: three strangers, connected only by destiny, who must band together if they are to save not only the Earth but their very souls.""Okay, the storyline stays true to the game, but is the rest of the movie any good?""An action/fantasy, ""Mortal Kombat"" relies more on spectacle than acting to win over audiences, and in this, it succeeds. Though outdated by modern standards, the film showcases CGI animation that was top-of-the-line for its time. And action? - the movie has little time to waste between its fast-paced martial arts encounters. Gems include Johnny battling Scorpion (Chris Casamassa, ""WMAC Masters) and Liu fighting Reptile (Keith Cooke,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation), with about half-a-dozen other fights stuck in between, ranging between pretty good and...well, pretty darn bad (e.g. Sonya vs. Kano, played by Trevor Goddard of ""J.A.G."" fame). In addition, the film suffers from a style of pop direction defined by minimal character development, lots of pose-striking during fights, and a storyline that ends up getting a bit lazy; a trademark of director Anderson that nevertheless disallows the film to appear like anything else than teen entertainment. What the movie does have on its side, though, is good casting: while nobody won any awards for their performances, you'll be hard-pressed to find anybody who disagrees that Robin Shou was made for the role of Liu Kang or that few besides Lambert make a good Rayden. Even the ninjas and the fellow who did Goro's voice are well-suited to their roles - at least more so than previous incarnations like Bob Hoskins as Mario or Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile.While the film has its flaws and might not be the best action movie around, you'll find few gaming marks who have many bad things to say about it, including me. Forget my negative comments for a moment and know that I'm very happy that this movie exists. No doubt it would've been a different film had it been made more recently, with more enduring graphics and a bit more action-cinema history to back it up, but the fact that it was made when it was and still managed to gain the acclaim that it did from both parties of viewers (action freaks and gaming geeks) says a lot. Video game fans, if you haven't yet seen it, then shame on you. Action fans, please proceed to your closest video rental shop..."
82464,1,"I agree with much of what K. Wagner of Rosslyn VA wrote.I use Digital Performer in the classroom. I noticed last year that Digital Orhestrator Pro, which preceded Record Producer Deluxe and by all accounts is the same program re-packaged, worked very much like the Digtal Performer software. I used it extensively and then decided to buy Record Producer when it was introduced. I upgraded to Deluxe when I realized I did not have all of the tools.Record Producer Deluxe interfaces well with my equipment. No problems yet.I have not used the FAQ page form Voyetra but I am getting close because of a nuance. I have noticed that Record Producer Deluxe arbitrarily changes my patches. For example, I assign patch 65 to an instrument but when it is saved and I load it again later, that patch may be (and usually is) changed to 64. The same goes if I assign 57, 58, 66 or 67. They all move. I have noticed that patch 68 stays in place. I don't know why this happens but it causes a sound problem when music is played back.One other thing that I really don't like is that wave sounds are not called waves, but RPP files and can not be accessed or played like waves. There is some special set up that Voyetra has inserted that keeps you from using any of the sounds and effects that come with the program. Bummer.The program may be hard to work with but I have not noticed as yet. I think that Digital Performer prepared me for it.I like this program, especially the piano roll editing, and really wish that Voyetra would concentrate on improving it by maybe intergrating a form of Music Write with it, making it good for universal use, like reading and accepting all types of audio files, adding a little color to the track lines, grouping the sliders, and charging more for the good product that it is and can be. Just now, it is like a toy but very useful. It is a good place to jump off"

If you have a different office suite package that does what you want then you'll be alot happier if you treated yourself out for a night of fun instead of buying this.

After he figures out how to make it do all the things he wants it to do, we will be ordering more up grades for it. He thinks it is a fantstic program for musicians from beginners and professionals."
49324,1,"I use my media center for a full media solution in my home bar/living area including music, pictures, home video, tv recording, dvd playing, and using the online features. Media Center 2005 had annoyances with navigation and features (like building play lists and managing the music queue) as well as looks (since media center was on while the music was on). This is a big improvment and guests are stunned. I'm am much happier using it. Funny thing is you always see a screen shot of media center with that nice background of the sea. Beware this is only in the ultimate edition and it looks as if it's not quite ready for release. But it still looks good with the standard darker blue. When I upgraded the system only had 1gb of memory and performance was a bit clunky especially when recording a couple programs and playing music. I upgrade to 2gb just recently and it was a great improvement.In have an HP media center computer with duel processors (Intel 820). I had already upgraded from the standard on board video card to an nVidia card as well as replacing the cheap tv card with a duel tuner Hauppauge WinTV-PVR 500 MCE and everything upgraded nicely. When I upgraded my other media center the on board sound didn't work so I replaced with an inexpensive creative labs audigy SE which Vista recoginized and loaded nicely. The video worked but after looking at the performance score it really brought it down. I upgraded this with an EVGA GeForce 7600GS and that brought the score right up to the other components.I did get a few errors that restarted the computer but Vista captured them and noted them as video issues and recommended updating the drivers. After I did that all has been smooth."

You can create cookbooks, add photos if you want, you can copy recipes from places like the Food Network and paste into the program and it puts everything in place for you like magic. YOU CAN ALSO IMPORT recipes you have from Meal-Master, MasterCook and other popular formats It automatically calculates nutritional information for each recipe you enter. You can search, create/print recipes, create menus (there is a calendar built in to help you) and aisle-by-aisle shopping lists. It has the ability to scale down your recipes. You can even download over 1,000 recipes into the program from their website. Best part is that it only cost $59.95. It is a bargain. Also, did I mention that you can export shopping lists to SplashShopper format for use in your PDA so you can take your lists to the store as printed sheets or in your Palm.They offer 3 versions -- Shop'NCook HOME, Shop'NCook MENU and Shop'NCook PRO which is for foodservice operations and has extra functions for calculating the cost of food preparation.[...]"

44770,1,"We have purchased several of the Europe maps and won't travel without them. Like another reviewer, we have named our Garmin (Emily) and find ourselves arguing with her sometimes, but she always gets us where we need to be. We used it recently to navigate the back streets of Venice. It is not quite as quick or accurate in the pedestrian mode, but it still beats trying to make sense of city maps and it is a comforting feeling that even if we are really lost, Emily will eventually help us find our way out. There are a few streets/roundabouts, that have changed - we talked to three other couples in France who, just as we had, been sent through a new housing project trying to get to one chateau. We had all followed our garmins and ended up at a dead end, but it ""recalculated"" and got us out! It finds gas stations, historical attractions, grocery stores, etc...Wonderful product - now, if it would just hook up with Google Earth so you could see specific attractions along the way - that would be perfect."

It is still a great product and I still recommend it most user's especially people who use it with their current computer right now.If are considering buying a new computer and choose Vista, please customize your computer for it to exceed your specific need's.

It installed easily...and I should note that although I've used several scanning packages, this is the first one I've bought. The capabilities of the software are truely awesome...some real virtuousity is clearly evident. Tables and text scan easily and flawlessly into every kind of file I can think of. Amazing.The problem I have with Finereader 5.0 Pro it is really two-fold. First, the manual is pathetic...nowhere would one discover how to use the product, much less what it is capable of delivering, if s/he relied on the manual. It just doesn't make sense and has loads of omissions. Second, the email support is literally useless...I don't really think there is anything but an email address at the other end... No response, at all. I was about 15 minutes from returning the whole box when I tried something completely illogical to change the scanner settings, when, Voila! The thing started working.Whatever, you do...don't rely on the manual. A good technical writer with several weeks' experience with this package could earn this company a lot of grateful and loyal customers. Are you ABBYY guys listening?"

Otherwise, it's straightforward, the menus are clear, and what's burned can be read by all my other devices. You'd think that last one wouldn't be a problem these days, but I still have that problem.

I bought this program over two months ago from Amazon, and I have not been able to install it or use it.The only reason I am giving this 3 stars instead of 1 star, is that I am familiar with previous versions of this program on previous computers, so I know it is potentially a wonderful program. But that doesn't do me (or you) much good, if you can't install it on a new computer running with Windows Vista. If you have a Vista-based computer, or are planning to upgrade your computer to Vista, do not waste your money on Starry Night Pro 6, until the manufacturer gets around to making a Vista-compatible version."
46459,1,"National Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations. First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver. These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7.5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps). But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway. It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck.Since these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information. Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind.These maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS. You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transfer them to the GPS. This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface. You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been. And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route. The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike. The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it. If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error. One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof.The major limitation at this point is that the software is not fully compatible with some of the newest GPS receivers. I can't use the USB cable with my Garmin GPSMap 60CS, but it works pretty well with the Serial cable, other than garbling waypoint names. Hopefully this will be fixed soon."
87874,1,"This product has made my Explorist 210 GPSr MUCH more functional and useful, especially for hiking. However, it isn't that intuitive to use -- given that these are all Magellan products you would think you wouldn't have to convert data formats two times, but you do. Oh well, I like the final product a lot."

Simply Flawless.Now with Broderbund as MB Teaches Typing Deluxe 16 on an iMac G5 running OS X is a so so product for graphics. Actually pooh, pooh.It works OK as a typing teaching tool. I recently got to a lesson and got a fatal error requiring me to Force Quit the program and start over. It went back to the same lesson and required another Force Quit.Broderbund's website doesn't have any support. No updates for the S/W.So, would I buy this again. Yeah, cause this is all that I know for teaching typing. If you can buy this for around $10ish plus shipping and handling like I did then OK."

It's still as powerful as it had been some time ago and differences may be marginal for what you have in mind, however it runs at lighning speed compared to the most up-to-date version. Plus, most if not all bugs got fixed! Apart from that, there's little to say about the leading office package - it's just perfect for almost everything you ever want to do, and some things you have to do."

67527,0,"I considered buying Virtual PC, but after careful consideration I went for the other option: A real PC, utilizing Windows XP Professional and the Windows Remote Desktop client for Mac (free from the Microsoft website).While this solution is more definitely more costly, it depends really dependes what your needs are. As I needed the PC to review PC software, I could not risk blaming the software for errors (or lack of performance) that might have been Virtual PCs fault. Yet, with Windows RDC I can copy and paste from and to my Mac, and have the PC handy in a little window at all times. The display does not refresh as quick as when not operated remotely, but on a 100MBit Ethernet-Connection, I can even listen to iTunes for Windows, and at least see movies at a reduced framerate.And if that is not fast enough, I still have the option of connecting a monitor to the PC, and see it run a full throttle. The Mac client uses very little performance on the Mac, which is nice.Yet, a word of caution: I found setting up my system painless, but I say the same thing about installing FreeBSD or Linux. You may want to have a PC-savvy person around. The setup also requires Windows XP Professional, Home does not support Remote Desktop clients."
91905,0,"This application works well. There one process, occasionally operating, that will consume all of your systems CPU cycles.... I never did learn how to restrict the process to my system disk or get it to idle when I wanted to use the machine (the process did idle but in a way that interfered with me using the computer). The interfering process scanns hard disks; some times I have 700GB of data storage disks attached. Disk scanning goes on for hours and hours with so much disk space to scan. A fix is to use a task monitoring program and set the processes priority to ""below normal""; this freed the machine for my use."

The ever-changing scenerios within the game keep it fresh and new every time he plays. I am still amazed that such a long and involved game can keep his attention for so long, and for so many times over. I credit that to the excellent animation, music, plot, and over-all challenge of the game. Although he has solved the mystery dozens of times over he still gets excited every time he does it again."

So even if your PC crashes you can still check the integrity of your hard disk. I have two suggestions for the vendor:One, include the printed user guide that came with version 3.0 with your newer versions. It is obvious from other reviews that most people need this technical information.Two, it is also obvious that most people need better support.It is a shame that what to me is one of the most valuable diagnostic tools around should be hampered by these issues which can so easily be fixed."
23270,1,What a deal! The software came on time and was exactly as advertised. I am very happy.
14831,1,"Ok first off, the drums sound great but there are a few things to keep in mind if your looking at this software for the first time.This is a virtual instrument NOT a DAW so if you just need to use the pre made grooves that come with it fine. If you want to create your own drum tracks you WILL need to buy other software to do that, so far most of the free DAW programs don't play well with this one.This software does come with a program that allows you to play EZdrummer as a standalone but aside from the mixer controls and beat per minute adjustment you wont be editing the tracks.The groove styles available are:Pop/rockFunk/rockMotownBalladBaiaoSambaThese are available in many different timings with fills for each style.Now for the bad partIf you're running Vista 64 bit(and I'm assuming Windows 7) the disk is useless, the serial number on the CD case is what you really need, here's how it goes:Go to the toontrack websitecreate an accounttype in the serial number (but don't authorize it until you finish everything else, read on)now download the newer version of EZdrummer, Toontrack solo and all the patches for themnow install EZdrummer from the download, patch it(pay attention to the instruction with the patch it's kinda weird if you running the 64 bit version) finish updating everything else then authorize it.I can understand that the disk comes with an out of date version of the software but when you download it straight from the site I think it is messed up that you still have to turn around and immediately patch the stuff.Bottom line: good drums, annoying install."
72201,0,"This program was probably the best of 2007, however, in 2010 it lacks compatability with the newer computer models and with Window's Vista or later. I would recommend that you post this clearly when people are looking for typing software. Currently, the description says that it is Vista compatible, but it could not be downloaded onto 2 of our computers, which had Vista, and nearly messed up the systems. We had to load it onto an older computer in order to get it to work. This needs to be clear from the start of the product description, before a person orders it. Otherwise, this program is very informative and user friendly. I would suggest, however, that you loose the soft speaking female voice and go with a more normal speaking one. This one talks to you like you are a 3 year old, and a slow one at that, and was beeeyyyyonddd irritating! Also, I think it would improve the learning experience if you expanded the typing curriculum for each exercise from three words or word groups to an entire line. For example: dfkj dfkj dfkj To: dfkj dfkj dfkj dfkj dfkj dfkj dfkj dfkj.... you get the idea. This type of tactile learning needs the repetition in order for the brain to remember it better."

80711,0,"I like the 7 translations version of this much better. Had it for years. It allowed me to look up a single word across the Bible, which if this one does I haven't been able to find it (and I've put in the time to look). It also doesn't have the NIV or the Living Translation, just versions/derivatives of the KJV. I guess I was expecting with 31 translations it would have the NIV (like the older version does). ""Thee's and Thou's"" and archaic speech patterns are hard to wade through.I do like that it compares the Gospels and events in Jesus's ministry across the Gospels. That is new and is nice. But I find myself reverting to my paper Bibles to actually read and compare in modern speech.The old 7 Translations version is still a solid '5' in my book."

However when I came back to reorder today I find the price has increased from 10.99 just a couple of weeks ago to 14.99 today. WOW-that's almost 40%! I'm going to have to shop around for an alternative. I think a 40% increase is a little greedy.

46239,1,"A fun program that my nephew has enjoyed for weeks. The activities keep him coming back over and over and the theme of helping each other and conservation are messages that it is never too early to expose children to. Like the Jay Jay Earns his Wings program, this one is a winner. Where can you get the Sky Circus program I see listed as discontinued?"
3176,1,"This program was a dream to use. I admit, I too was very skeptical about payingSo much for any piece of language software, but now after moving through the program, I see just how powerful the technique is. ... ... The Rosetta Stone software is much different, they guarantee your unconditional success, and if you don't achieve it, you return the software. That was enough to sell me. Also, if you need more proof, it's the same software the U.S. State department uses, as well as many other language schools throughout the world, with great customer service.The most unique and most baffling aspect of the program is the fact that there's no grammar. For most who have tried venturing into a new language, doing so without grammar seems way too good to be true, but I'm living proof, it does work. More times than not, I felt frustrated that no translation was provided, but this forced me to pay attention more to the slight differences, and I think helped me pick up the language quicker. I used to think that was a terrible idea, it was indeed very frustrating, but since there's only four pictures to choose from, it won't take too much time for you to figure things out, repetition it a must, and your new vocabulary will stay with you for a long time. Also a plus, the program is simple to use, and very basic, no reading a long technical manual here. RecommendAs you can see, I strongly believe the program excels on all levels, but now, on to the things that weren't so great. The lack of a grammar book of some sort could be a major set back for those who get frustrated easily. Like I said before, the program is very simple and easy to use. This is also a drawback, yes, I like being able to understand the interface but, where were the sides games, I felt like the program was missing something in that area. Also, I feel the whole issue about the pronunciation meter is a little strange. In this program, you can talk to it through a microphone and it will tell you how fluent you sound. Seems fair enough but, there are many different ways to pronounce Spanish. There's the way they speak in Spain, in Latin America, (Mexico standing out as well) and different in southern America. The differences sometimes might seem subtle, but why not have the program address this with different speakers for different regions? Also, as a male, I found it difficult to pronounce words like the female orator. I don't know why they didn't record a male and a female version from which I could choose for everything.This program is wonderful, with its minor faults. The most important thing I could say is, it is the best you'll find out there for now. No book, tutor, or [less expensive] software even comes close. I advise you buy the software and dedicate yourself to it for at least 30 minutes for ten days. The more you put into it, the more you will get out. If at that point you feel it's not working, send it back. I promise you'll be glad you tried it. I hope you achieve your language learning goals. ..."

93732,1,"Delorme Earthmate PN-20 Handheld GPS (with Topo USA 8.0 & 1-GB SD Card & Reader)I have owned Lowrance, Magellan, and Garmin GPSR's and (nothing) compares with the value of this package. My last GPS was a Garmin 60CSX which is a excellent unit but the maps are expensive and lacking detail. The Colorado and Oregon are a step backwards in my opinion in both quality and features.No extra crap like a camera, recorder, games, or other useless frills. Earthmate PN-20 is the best deal around if you are going off-road or just wanting to get there!The Good: Earthmate PN-20 an easy to use highly sensitive receiver with excellent features. Most importantly the package comes with arguably best map package available. Throw in the the capability of aerial imagery, USGS7.5 Topos and NOAA charts what's not to like?The Bad: Nothing I have found! What you will see is slower redraw speeds than the PN-30&40 but acceptable. A 2.2"" diagonal display is not the largest you can buy but it is very easy to read."
73836,1,"Jumpstart Advanced Preschool is an excellent 3-disc set of softare for children 2-4 years old. Each disc consists of a series of games which are explained by, and feature, delightful animated characters that your children will adore. These games teach fundamental skills like counting,letter recognition,shape sorting, musical appreciation, and so on.At the start of each set of games, an animal 'pet'(rabbit, cat, lizard, etc.)is selected. With the successful completion of each game,the player is given a reward (some food, a toy, a brush...) for the pet to eat or play with. Kids love this. They giggle as they watch the dog chew his snacks and smile, or the cat play with his flashlight. After 4 reward items are acquired, the player is then encouraged to find the pet a loving home (they take off in a hot-air balloon and fly over potential new homes).It's amazing to see how this simple reward system can motivate a child! My 3 year old son has been using this software for the past month and he never gets tired of it. He's excited every time he wins a new reward. Parents can customize the level of difficulty for each subject area, so the games should never get too easy or too difficult. Keeping the games at the appropriate level ensures that your child never gets bored or frustrated.I haven't experienced any of the problems that some other reviewers have complained about. The sound and visuals all work perfectly. What's more, this software is very user-friendly. My 3 year old doesn't even need my help with it. He just sits at the computer and starts playing on his own (but it's fun to play with him, so I'm usually right by his side).One piece of advice: I strongly recommend that participants listen to the spoken instructions before playing each game. If you begin clicking your mouse before the instructions have finished, you will immediately jump to the game before you know what you're doing. But, even if this happens, don't worry. Just click the ""back arrow"" button, and the instructions will repeat. Other than that, this is as easy as 1..2..3."

I manage the IT department of a company that has laptop users that can't be away from their computers long enough for me to defrag them, so I thought I'd try Diskeeper because it defrags in the background.Yes, the initial manual defragmentation is slower than Norton...BUT, it defragmented the drive on my laptop to 0.1% fragmentation, while Norton Speedisk never got below around 3%. Add to that the fact that I didn't have to exit out of any processes running in the background.After doing the initial defragmentation, I set the Diskeeper to &quot;Set it and forget it&quot; and it works in the background.

Unlike some of the other reviewers, we didnt have any issues with the installation (on XP Professional SP2).The graphics are not quite as slick as some of the other Reader Rabbit programs (like Reader Rabbit Preschool, etc).The pace is very good, and the program repeats basic sounds, so this follows the 'phonics' method. A group of chipmunks teach the sounds and reading skills, and they have kept my 4 year old engaged, and she has made great progress.A 2nd CD comes with this that gives you some printable games, a collection of the Reader Rabbit sounds, and some sample-training games."
36291,1,"At the end of my rope due to the now-legendary &quot;impossible upgrade&quot; to McAfee 5.1 (and mightily frustrated by their offensive pricing policies and monstrous (2-4 MB) update files), I was pleasantly shocked at how much easier PC-Cillin was to use and update. I'd call it ideal for anyone who *doesn't* want to be constantly sniveled at by their virus checker. Norton and McAfee are always &quot;in your face,&quot; which to me is the wrong way to make an impression.Two minor issues: First, the Netscape mail-paralyzer glitch mentioned in a prior review is easily remedied. In Netscape, click Edit, Preferences, Mail Servers, and under Incoming Server, replace &quot;host&quot; with your mail server. (This is a documented bug and the fix is shown on the manufacturer's website.) And PC-Cillin doesn't protect against malicious scripts (VBS, etc.). All that means is, you have to be smart enough to disable scripting for mail &amp; news -- which is hardly a necessary feature for the majority of home users."

There are businesses on the map that weren't even built until recently.One of the things I enjoy doing with it is to plot a route to a place I know well, and then take a different route. The eTrex calculates a new route quite quickly, but it sometimes takes a little while to convince it I am NOT going to make a U-turn.The software on the computer is not quite as friendly. The routing tool hangs on to the mouse pointer and that sometimes results in unintended waypoints.Good GPS software and almost good computer software."

I purchased the ""Preferred"" version because of it's ability to use bluetooth headsets.. true wireless!I am also the kind of person who likes to load up the software and start using it whithout reading anything.. I know, not a smart way to go.DNS 9 was pretty darn accurate right out of the box without any training involved. Computer Mag reviews have put it at 90%. I mainly use DNS 9 for typing situations in MS-Word. You can add words to the custom speech vocabulary and you can dictate e-mails. If you have to write long reports for work, this software will be ideal. The box says it's 3 times faster than typing.. for me it's like 10 times faster. Give it a try.. I think you'll be impressed."

90188,0,This product is overpriced for its use. It is rarely used in the school world. This product to most is hard to use and requires better HELP programs in the software.
30630,1,"This is the first computer game we bought for our 2 1/2 year-old. Since she was a complete novice using the computer, I liked the way she could manipulate the game by just touching keys on the keyboard. However, she very soon figured out that she could also use the mouse to move the game along-without needing to click at all. Just moving the cursor, which is a miniature Mickey Mouse gloved hand, causes letters, shapes, and numbers to pop out or go away. By now she has learned to go from one screen to another by merely moving the cursor to the right spot on the screen, for instance to go from letters with Mickey to shapes with Minnie, or to colors with Goofy.(There is also sounds and musical effects with Donald, and numbers with Pluto.) Hence she is able to play the game entirely by herself, and loves to do so. In this regard it seems the perfect game to start out a little one on the computer.In addition the game itself is entertaining due to the cute graphics and cheery music. My daughter enjoys moving her feet and humming along to the music played when finding shapes with Minnie. Each different character has its own &quot;theme&quot; music. The only real drawback to this game is that it would probably be too slow and un-stimulating to a child who already has lots of computer experience, and would also be boring to an older child who already knows their letters, shapes, numbers and colors really well, or who needs more interaction from computer games of software."

94833,2,"This thing is a nightmare. First, it is impossible to understand unless you already know how to run some other comparable system. Next, it requires a huge amount of fiddling with buffers (believe me -- read the help files on this, which are huge and suggest ten different things to do when your music doesn't sound good, and trust me, it won't, either before or after unlimited tweaking). Finally, it actually does not export as it says it does. It lost my files, including one song I cannot quite reproduce (gone forever). Bottom line: If your idea of fun is spending two weeks of vacation fiddling with software that does not work and will never work, then by all means, buy this garbage. I have been using computers since 1985, and this is, I think, the worst single product I've ever seen. On the other hand, if you want to actually make music, you might want to try Sony's ACID Pro 6, which you can try out for free (the company thinks you'll like it, whereas the sadists at Cakewalk must know perfectly well that you won't, hence no demo)."

Neither of them had any idea what was going on in the class, and when they took tests, they got scores ranging from D to 'Other.' The teacher suggested that they start using ChemTutor Excalibur to study. Reluctantly, the students gave the program a try, in hopes of salvaging their poor grades. Almost immediatley, after using ChemTutor every night a couple nights before each test, their scores jumped into the B range. Their teacher was very impressed. The students were very happy.We have used ChemTutor extensivley this semester, and whenever we spend some time with it before a test, our scores always turn out good. ChemTutor is pretty awesome.A True Story by Read Connolly &amp; Sungkyu Hahn"

39616,0,"Well after reading the reviews here I thought this might be a great game that I somehow missed. Now first off for the budget price I paid I won't ramble too long and yes I do realize that the graphics are dated so enough about the obvious.One thing that I did not know about and my major gripe with the game... It is absolutley linear in nature. Yes you can go all out guns or stealth around but the premise is that you get your mission and start at point A and go to point B. The mission ends then and there an you go back to headquarters for your next mission. AI is weak to say the least and stealthy approaches are laughable in how the computer handles it.While it does offer you more approaches than say HL2 or other plain FPS games it still boils down to pure linear missions. Role playing amounts to leveling points in melee/small guns/large guns/lockpicking/electronics/etc. Nothing really special here and there is essentially no selling and/or buying items (a random walking npc will offer to sell 2 ammo clips here and there, plain vanilla stuff)I do feel as though this was a great game in its time but understand that this is no futuristic Morrowind or KOTR."

57260,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

After purchasing and receiving the program I found there was a flaw in installing it to my desktop PC. I contacted Amazon (from where it was purchased) and they agreed to send me a replacement. In the meanwhile I decided to telephone Microsoft just to see if they had a fix on my problem (I didn't want to go thru the whole problem with another program). I spoke with a gentleman who walked me thru the installation process using a few back doors. It worked and everything was fine (what will happen if I have to re-install the program, I don't know). The one thing that I found lacking in the program is to plan a course on your own using major highways in your location. Most of the info I get is extrmely detailed using local streets other than highways that I would rather choose.

16713,1,"Without a doubt, z3ta+ is the best software synth around. For those looking for a sweet analog sound but do not have the money to buy a Waldorf or an Andromeda, z3ta+ is your best choice by far. The amount of parameters on the device is staggering to say the least. You can practically control everything with its own LFO or envelope (You can control LFOs with more LFOs). There is an ungodly amount of oscillators as well, making this the most sonically capable synthesizer available for under $2k. And the best thing, z3ta+ sounds amazing! The only thing that detracts from it is its rather steep learning curve. If you are a sound crafter, expect a couple of days of toying before you are comfortable with it. For me, it was just as hard to grasp as FM synths. (Which some found easy actually)"

44850,1,"I was somewhat surprised to read the reviews of a minority of malcontents. No, this product does not have the detail of USGS topographic maps, but it never claimed that it did! The trade-off is that it covers the whole country. Yes you can buy detailed maps on CD-ROM from Maptech, DeLorme and NGS Topo but it would cost you a couple thousand dollars to cover the entire US. I have not had any problems with displaying maps in 3-D either, it works fine. I have been using DeLorme products for many years and I can also vouch for their product support.However this is serious software for people who like maps, cartography, GPS and navigation. It has many capabilities that require buyers to make sure that their computers meet the minimum requirements and spend some time to learn how to use it.

69685,0,"The game was a good mix of elements. It had a good plot -- find out who is scaring people away with phony ghost dogs and why -- and the three suspects were all interesting and all suspicious in their own way. The idea of the historical mystery was also good and realistic, it was simply the execution that was lacking.And by that, I mean the puzzles related to the historical componant made no sense. Or rather made no sense with the information you were given by the historical figure. Instead you're supposed to solve a number of the puzzles not using information gathered from research, but by a conveniently placed modern primer on Roman Numerals. This was very frustrating to find that all the hard sleuthing work would turn up nothing. I dislike having to go to walkthroughs for solutions, but even worse is reading the solution and finding that the writer doesn't know why that's the solution either, it's just simply the way the game works. I'm just not a fan of poking things until something works, I like to go in armed with the info to solve the problem.The modern puzzles/tasks were fine and interesting if you're in the mood for a nature hike and learning about birds and birdwatching."

27059,1,"""Secret of the Old Clock"" is probably among the most unique Nancy Drew games. This game was released in 2005, and in honor of her 75th anniversary, this game was released. Its title comes from the first Nancy Drew book ever published, and the story itself is a mix of the first four Nancy Drew books ever published (""The Secret of the Old Clock"", ""The Hidden Staircase"", ""The Bungalow Mystery"", and ""The Mystery at Lilac Inn""). To add to the feeling of authenticity, ""Secret of the Old Clock"" takes place in 1930, the year that the book was published.In this game, a young woman named Emily Crandall has asked Nancy to drive out to her Lilac Inn to meet her, saying she'd like her to do her a favor. This takes Nancy by surprise, as she doesn't really know Emily aside from their mutual friend Helen Corning. However, thoughtful as she is, Nancy accepts.When Nancy drives out to the Inn, she meets Emily's guardian Jane Willoughby, who is legally responsible for Emily now that Gloria Crandall (her mother) has passed away (her father died in battle years ago). Jane tells Nancy that Emily has been acting strangely, but Nancy dismisses this, thinking that she's probably full of grief and stress after losing her mom and trying to run the inn on her own.Nancy goes upstairs to meet with Emily in her room. Emily tells Nancy that she'd like her to lock her mother's jewelry up in a safe, to keep it safe from all of the ""weird things"" that have been happening around the Inn lately. Nancy's curiosity gets going about these ""weird things"", but she has little time to ask before the stove in the kitchen ignites!Nancy, Emily, and Jane all run out to escape the fire. The fire department arrives in time to save the Lilac Inn, but not in time to save the stove. With the stove gone, the Lilac Inn will no longer be able to serve its famous pies, meaning it could have to shut down for good. Not only that, but the priceless jewelry was stolen in the midst of it all!All of the financial trouble that was happening in the 30's (the game takes place right before the Great Depression) and lack of a stove makes Emily blurt out that she wishes Josiah Crowley - a rich old man who'd recently passed away - had left her money in his will like he said he would. When Nancy asks about this, she learns that Mr. Crowley had promised he'd leave various people who he cared about money when he died, but when his will was found, they were left nothing and all of his belongings went to an ESP expert named Richard Tompham.Just what happened to the jewelry? Why did the stove ignite? Is the will that was found the true will of Josiah Crowley? If so, why would a sweet old man like him break his promises? Nancy's now determined to find out the truth by solving her first case...The storyline is pretty strong, and actually flowed very impressively, which I imagine would be hard to do when combining *four* stories into one. The mystery does eventually branch off into two or three different cases in and of itself, but it's actually all weaved together rather nicely by the end. The ending was very good, and I really can't complain about how things turned out at all.I rather liked being able to explore and sneak around the Lilac Inn, as well as a few other places, like Josiah Crowley's old house (now inhabited by Topham) and the town's bank. This is also the first game to use the driving feature, which gives the player the ability to ""drive"" around Titusville (the name of the city the game's taking place in) by controlling the car from an areal view with their mouse. I had mixed feelings about the driving feature, as it does get hard to control and it's possible to lose the game if a flat tire isn't properly taken care of. Still, it was also a cute little feature that was fun to include in a game. I do miss seeing everything from Nancy's perspective, though...The puzzles were fun, and I liked the majority of them, but some of them were pretty hard to get through and felt like they rewarded little. The golfing challenge in particular was extremely hard to get through, and I'd say I spent at least a good half hour trying to win that section of the game alone. The sewing challenge was also pretty hard the first time around, but I felt it was easier once I got the hang of it.Since the game does take place in 1930, there are lots of modern luxuries that were in previous games that did not appear in this game. For example, Nancy doesn't have a cell phone, and has to drive back to the Lilac Inn to use the coin phone on the porch whenever she wants to make a call. The phone friends in this game were nice, and this is the first (and so far, only) game in which Nancy has the ability to call her dad for hints and insight into the case. I really liked having Carson Drew in the game, and I'm hoping he makes his second appearance soon.Speaking of the coin phone - that's another new feature employed in this game. This is the first game to employ the use of money, and Nancy must pay to get various tasks done (i.e. paying for more gas, buying things for other people, etc.). It's possible to run low on money, but Nancy can also drive around town delivering telegrams in exchange for some money. Delivering telegrams can get tedious at times, but the small conversations that are always sparked between Nancy and the person she's delivering the telegram to always brought about some comedic relief. Some of them were actually pretty funny.The characters were well-integrated, and all seemed to have good reason to be the culprit. I wasn't sure who necessarily would be the culprit at the end, but there was enough to make me suspect everybody at times (even Emily). The culprit choice was actually rather surprising, and employed a move that'd never been used before when explaining the culprit's motive. While some may have their doubts about this, I felt it was rather nicely written into the story and made the game even more unique.The suspects in this game include Emily Crandall, a 17-year-old orphaned girl who seems to have been losing her marbles ever since her mother died and feels like she's incapable of running Lilac Inn. Jane Willoughby was Gloria Crandall's best friend from years ago, and is currently acting as Emily's guardian until she turns 18; she's trying to convince Emily to sell the Inn thinking that she should take advantage of her youth while she still has it. Jim Archer is Emily's banker who seems to be a little evasive about the situations going on at the Lilac Inn, and also thinks Emily should sell the Inn before the bills start getting too high. Richard Topham is Josiah Crowley's former ESP trainer who's residing in Josiah's old house, who's inherited all of Crowley's belongings and views the Crandalls and Mr. Archer as selfish people who only loved Josiah because he had a lot of money.""Secret of the Old Clock"" has a rather nice selection of music. None of it was my own personal cup of tea, because I prefer scarier music. The game does feature some nice 30's music, though. All of it complimented the game itself, and I think that the soundtrack really couldn't get much better than it already is.Is ""Secret of the Old Clock"" as strong of a game as most of the classic 13 Nancy Drew games? No. I do miss seeing everything from Nancy's perspective, and some of the puzzles and challenges were very hard and frustrating. However, is it a bad game? Most definitely not! The story is wonderful, and I really liked the cast. It still features more first person exploration than a lot of the more recent games do, and it still holds the feel-good ""classic Nancy Drew game"" feeling that the first 13 games had. While this wouldn't be my top recommendation for a Nancy Drew game, it'd definitely still be high up in my gaming recommendations, and should be played by anybody who wants to play all of the ""good"" Nancy Drew games or those who want to take a blast into the past and catch a cunning criminal by finding out the secret surrounding the old clock. :) 4 stars for this gem of a game!"
30209,1,"I have been using Complete Home Designer 4.0 and decided to upgrade to 5.0 a few months ago, and I am not disappointed! First of all, don't expect a no-brainer interface and don't think that an architect will necessarily be able to build what you've designed. This software is less about structural design (there aren't that many low-price programs that can handle that aspect) than it is about visualization. If you want to see your designs beautifully rendered, this is the program to use. Shadows and lighting are rendered very realistically and you can simulate light conditions of virtually any time of day as well as choose geographic locations. The new structural features in this version include polygonal free roof design - where there is virtually no limit to the complex roofs you can design, and a customized window designer. These, to me, are the two biggest advantages over the previous version. Whereas most home design software available is limited to three floors, Complete Home Designer 5.0 gives you up to ten, so you can design your dream apartment house if you want! There is a large library of furnishings and details you can add to your design and some additional objects are available for download on the Internet. As I intimated in the title, there are a few quirks in the program. The parent program on which this is based originated in Germany, so you will find some pop-up windows and menu items are labeled in German and not in English! This is odd but doesn't really interfere with the program itself. Also, the program crashes occasionally. This too is annoying but the program is set to automatically backup whatever you're working on every minute or so, so you can usually recover your file and pick up where you left off. If you want to have fun designing buildings as a hobby or want to get a great visual preview of a house project before consulting an architect and don't mind a somewhat steep learning curve, I would recommend this program."

Knowing that GPS is not 100% accurate, I feel the Earthmate USB is accurate enough to figure out where you are and to find your way. Only downfall is the mapping software. The main roads are fairly accurate. The side roads have less to be desired. Because of that, this product only gets 4 out of 5 stars."

65118,1,"I knew that I wanted to get some sort of monitor calibration hardware for my setup, but I wasn't sure which to buy. After a very embarassing incident involving client approval proofs of a design that had color variations I couldn't even see on my monitors, I knew I had to act quickly. I am a photographer and graphic designer using dual LCD monitors on a PC platform (I know all you Mac users out there are frothing at the mouth, but I do a fair amount of 3D animation with high end PC only software). It is important for me to have accurate color for both photography and design work, but I thought Adobe Gamma was solving my problems. Apparently not. I researched both the Spyder and Pantone's Huey system, and I chose the Spyder.Setup and calibration is pretty straightforward. Be prepared to spend an hour or so getting started. Recalibration takes about 45 min. each time you do it. I was very picky about the calibration, and so it took maybe longer than it needed to. The software, in conjunction with the colorimeter hardware measures a variety of things as it sits on your screen. It has you tweak the colors (RGB) of your screen individually using the monitor's front panel controls, as well as brightness and contrast. This can be tedious, but it's worth it. Once you have brought the values into balance, it then re-measures everything and creates a profile that loads every time you start up your computer. A nice feature of the software is that it shows you a before and after calibration example. I was amazed at how far off my monitors were!I've compared original ur-retouched photos with the final worked files and been astounded at how little I really needed to do to the originals. It also explained a lot of frustrating trips back and forth to the lab. As a bonus, I now see all of the things I missed while using the computer. User interfaces and on screen graphics are much more nuanced than I ever knew.I will concur with an earlier poster, however, that the profile will not reload after coming out of hibernation. Colorvision recommends that you turn off power management, and never let your computer go into stand by or hibernation because it can't send the profile back to the video card at wake up. This is an annoying feature and I hope they address it in some sort of patch.Even if you aren't a professional, if you care about your family photos, or simply about having a much more visually appealing computing experience, you should consider the Spyder."
75629,1,"This product is very well written and demonstrated, but it requires a good deal of work - the kind of work required for competency in math. I teach and tutor math at a local Davenport University and from years of experience I can assure you that most people's difficulty in math stems from a lack of rigorous ""wrangling"" with basic math concepts. In other words, most students don't want to ""work through"" thoroughly the examples in any given chapter. Instead, they just want someone to show them how to do the homework problems for class credit. And by thoroughly, I mean a step-by-step prodcedure for understanding the logic (not just the ""math"" numbers) from one step to the next. Yes, this takes time and effort, and that's what MindPower will do for you, but not if you're just looking for quick answers and fixes.That some people have had difficulty with the programs actually working is another problem and has nothing to do with the excellence of the math material presented.

19141,1,"We have two ""special"" grandsons. One has Asberger's Syndrone and the other is Autistic. One of the things that both of these boys love is trains. This game will probably have to be replaced at some point because they play is so much when they are here. We are so fortunate that there are special ed programs that are helping these kids so much. They are great guys and we love them to pieces. This is an excellent source of pleasure for them. Also train videos and we take them to model railroad museums and on as many train rides as we can. We are really lucky to have these boys. And they are so fortunate for what is out there for them. Trains being a BIG thing."
44683,1,"I've had ""Totally Mad"" since it came out (they couldn't give me the toilet paper, but they gave me a Mad Mousepad). I've used it through Win95, 2000, and XP, but I am having problems with Win7 (The first disk will load under Win7 but the it rejects the other disks) and yes, it's no longer updated and supported. Yes there is now a ""Absolutely Mad"" (which has more issues) on one DVD but ""Totally Mad"" has a better search feature and bonuses of Videos, Mad Songs etc., outside of just the issues.I'm going to keep it anyway, maybe load it on a old laptop with XP or something."

48014,0,"I found this method made this language very accessible to a native English speaker. It shows pictures, shows the word, and plays the sound of the word so that they can all become connected together in the mind - a method that brings the learner much closer to fluency. I was glad that the method didn't rely upon connecting the Korean word with the English one - a method that requires the learner to first recall the ""English"" word in order to access the memory for the Korean one.Unlike one of the other reviewers, I was also glad that the interactive version allowed the listener to listen to the properly pronounced word instead of showing a ""phonetic"" spelling. The Korean language has many consonants for which there is no English equivalent, like a letter between k and g, a letter between l and r, and a letter between p and b, and those can be extremely difficult and even more confusing to describe than simply listening to the properly pronounced word and trying to mimic it. The native Engligh speaker who tries to substitute an English ""equivalent"" for one of the actual sounds will be learning to pronounce the word incorrectly! And a language learned improperly in the first place is much more difficult to correct than simply learning it correctly the first time.My biggest gripe about this method is that it doesn't take advantage of the inherent logic in the Korean alphabet - which is phonetic itself! If there was only a single chapter on the characters and their pronunciations, then this program would be complete. As it stands, I would recommend that the student of Korean first study the alphabet before beginnning this program. The lack of focus on the Korean characters and their pronunciations is the reason that I give this program only 3 stars."
26977,0,"I've been using this product for about a month. I don't disagree that Kaspersky has an excellent virus scanning engine and does it's job well, but is the user interface miserable. It seems to be written by microsoftian overlords: the buttons and check boxes suggest that you have control over the various functions, but there is no ability to turn them off or control them. Everything is some sort of security violation, when I launch a new mail in outlook, (granted I have a older version), it's a security violation (yes I know it's just the training mode, I'm not an idiot.) And there is no easy way to dismiss the dialog, you have to accept, accept, accept, it's like that !@#! robbie the robot, warning. Warning. Warning. Yeah so some .dll is trying to do xyz. Allow or Deny? Uhhh... I suppose I could set the firewall to allow all traffic; I really thought the whole point of an firewall was the *it* would figure out what the bad packets were. Kaspersky is not a bad product, it just amazingly annoying and counterproductive to getting stuff done."
2590,1,This is a great product. Tho it can have more loops it has mant loops to choose from. We even use the product at my middle school. Its fun to use. My friends all gathered around and we made realy cool music from this 4 year old age group product. Super Duper is a great family product but is even better for TEENS! Yeah not 10 year old but teens. You can make realy heavy music. But not to discourage the parent from buying this wonderful product. This product is #1 on my list

32069,1,I had this product over six years. I made many greeting cards that I saved. What is neat about this product is that you can go on line and get fresh cards and down load them. To my dismay when my computer went into the shop for repairs they lost my CreataCard CD. I was like an addict without a fix. I could not get excess to my saved Cards and I could not make new ones. Also no new product would do the same. I was lucky to find an used CreataCard and now I await for it's arrival.

I have an iMac G4 Flat Panel. But when I tried to upgrade to Tiger, it wouldn't allow me because it told me I still had errors. So TTP was either lying or couldn't really fix the problem. Enter DW. I used the external drive as the start-up (after backing up EVERYTHING) and put DW to the test. Within 30 minutes, it had reparied all the damage and allowed my Tiger to upgrade, error-free! Nice job DW! I will now use it to maintain my files and keep TTP as a last resort."

60138,1,"I've seen a lot of reviews here where people have said they've had trouble. I've had none. This product worked well, right out of the box. It was so easy to use that I was able to capture video from by camcorder, compile a video and burn it to CD in about 40 minutes, never having done any of those things before. That impressed me. Since then, I've bought a DVD writer, and this software has burned those discs perfectly, too. The only downside I've seen, having now used this product for about two months, is that it's very, very slow on my machine (which is only a 1GHz processor).The upside, though, is that every aspect of this product has worked perfectly, and that's saying a lot. Video capture, manipulation and recording are tricky things. If you're system is like mine, assembled from parts, you never know what might pop up as incompatible. So I've been very pleased with how smoothly the product has worked. Most impressive are the extremely powerful editing features. You can do a lot of slicing and dicing of captured video, and do it very easily, even if you have no training or experience. That's what sells this product for me. On that basis, I'd recommend it.However, noting the number of reviews by people who experience problems, I can't help but note that it's a good idea to buy from a vendor with a friendly return policy. Fortunately, I won't need to make use of that feature.Overall, a good product that's powerful and easy to use."
40045,1,We bought it because it allows us to make iPhone ringtones in garage band with any song from our iTunes for free. Sure beats paying $1.98 for the song and ringtone from the iTunes music store... Once you add the other features it makes sense. All of the other programs make sharing our digital media with friends easier too.

The product I received was only for OS9 and did not work on my newer Macintosh computer. I'm still working with the reseller to receive a refund for the product which I, sadly, had to return. I am still looking for an actual OSX-compliant version of the Big Box of Art."
57295,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

36530,0,"This is not a comprehensive program. If this is the only tool you use to learn a Japanese, you will never get very far because all it does is teach you to memorize phrases. There are no daily lesson plans, no step-by-step approach - just a list of phrases to memorize, and then different ways to test your memory.BUT, this is a great program to use in *addition* to a more comprehensive course. If you take Japanese at school (or at home, using a better program such as Rosetta Stone) this program could help fill in the gaps in your main course of study. The thing that is really helpful about this, is that it includes video clips of native speakers carrying on everyday conversations. There are also lots of handy ""travel phrases"" that may not be taught in other programs.JapaneseNow is a great way to supplement another course, but it does not stand alone."

50589,0,"As other reviewers have stated, it's an excellent interactive learning experience for your child. I give it 4 or 5 stars on that alone. But I was dismayed to find that the setup process stuck an AOL promotion on my desktop (my other Reader Rabbit programs also did it). And of course, the unwelcome desktop icon was just a shortcut; I had to search in the Programs folder for the AOL executable file in order to delete it. A major annoyance!This sort of thing is not terribly unusual with free applications that you download from the Internet, but when I pay money for a program, I don't expect it to come with adware junk.Another problem is that once you've started one of the programs running, there's no way to back out of it or shut it down before it quits. There's no right-click menu with a Cancel button or anything like that. Very inconvenient if you're simply giving a program a quick test. I had to use the Windows CTRL-ALT-DEL trick to shut it down in midstream.Bottom line: great for the kid, a pain in the behind for dad."

61788,1,"I am a computer professional. After reading all the reviews (here on amazon and elsewhere) I hesitated to delve into consumer level video editing software because I expected buggy and awkward software and a frustrating experience.Suffice it to say I decided to buy this as my video editing program about 15 minutes after opening it (make sure you download and try the fully functional 30 trial before purchase).The ""help wizards"" (real time task oriented help) are very effective and the interface is very intuitive! I completed my first capture perfectly using just the wizard's instructions. I was very pleasantly surpised how intuitive the ""timeline"" interface is (all video and audio you are working with to make your movie is shown as data in 6 parrallel lines across the screen. You can easily see how every input lines up with the other ""tracks"" and where every element begins and ends, etc.The install and the initial startup went perfectly (be forewarned however that even the free download requests online registration at first run)I have a celeron laptop with 256 mb and performance is fine. I did drop a few frames during the capture but only when I tried to run other programs at the same time as the capture.I understand Vegas doesnt support .mov files but my mini DV recorder doesn't use them so this is no limitation for me.All in all, I highly recommend you download the free 30 day and give it a whirl if you want to archive your mini DV videos to your computer and/or create movies from them. http://mediasoftware.sonypictures.com"
58827,1,I found that Encore was easy to use for someone who didn't know how to author or even create DVDs or menus.

94893,2,"As with many of the other reviewers of this product, I too have used Norton Utilities, and later Systemworks for years. In all fairness, I have never had any of the issues that some reviewers have described here. Norton never deleted programmes, or otherwise screwed up my system. In my experience, problems such as those described here are more often end user (that's you, the computer user) screw ups, not problems caused by the programme itself. Many people choose to ignore the instructions to shut down all other running progammes, including those running in the background, before installing any new software, and that more than anything else causes the problems described in several of the reviews here.Nonetheless, I will not be buying Systemworks 2005. Over the last few years, I have watched as Norton has gutted Systemworks of most of its functionality. Today Systemworks 2005 is ittle more than a virus scanner with file backup and recovery capability. One reviewer mentioned that they would like to see a hard drive maintenance utility added, well for years there was a hard drive maintenance utility included, now it has been taken out. You used to get Clean Sweep as part of Systemworks, no longer though; it too was removed. You used to get a disk wiping utility to permanently wipe out unwanted files or to wipe clean that supposedly blank space on your hard drive. Again, that utility is no longer included in Systemworks. Even little utilities such as System Information appear to have been left out of Systemworks 2005.The virus scanner, in my opinion, is still the best in the business, and is the only reason I give Systemworks two stars instead of one. But I'm not going to pay $50 (here) or $60 (on the Norton web site) for a programme that is essentially nothing more than an over-bloated virus scanner.I actually gave up on Norton Systemworks 2004 earlier last year and switched to Vcom's System Suite 5, it had almost all the features and performance I had come to expect in Norton Utilities or Systemworks, and it was less expensive. Now Vcom has added spyware detedtion and removal and improved their anti-virus programme in addition to everything that System Suite already had. So rather than waste $50 or $60 on a gutted Norton Systemworks 2005, I upgraded to System Suite Professional 6 for only $29.95"

6314,0,"You should only get this if you really nead it ... unfortunately, you probably do. Although overall this is a fairly decent attempt by Microsoft to make something asthetically pleasing and Mac like, it is hampered by the usual Microsoft problems:1. It keeps 'helping' you when you don't want it to. Although you can presumably turn most of these features off you probably wont have the time or inclination to find out how to. So you'll have the pleasure of being confronted by offers to create Powerpoint slides when you open up Word, have brackets turned into smilies as well as a host of other random edits and substitutions that are correct maybe 10% of the time.2. It is bloated with features most of which still don't work correctly. I would say this is slightly worse than the Windows version. For instance, the bulleting and numbering seems to go wrong or randomly switch between styles more often and the styles and header numbering is even less stable.In addition to these standard MS problems they've managed to make the whole thing run really very slowly. I'm using a G4 Powerbook and Word cannot even always keep up with my moderate touch typing speed (i.e. there is a noticable lag between typing and words appearing). If you are editing a document with lots of numbering then you will notice delays in the order of seconds when, for instance, deleting selections - even small ones.Overall: a decent looking release hampered by the usual Microsoft problems and a general sluggishness."

71421,1,"This is an amazing program and an unbelievable bargain. As other reviewers have noted, be sure you have enough computer horsepower for the task--this is a general video editing requirement not unique to Premier. Digitizing video can be a nightmare or a breeze, depending on your system and hardware. For example Turtle Beach makes a great $100 video/audio digitizer (VideoAdvantage-USB) that puts out frame-acccurate DV format which is as good as video from a DV camera. Although Premier doesn't directly support this digitizer, the TB unit includes a program that captures video and saves the files in AVI format for easy Premier import. I have a box full of analog Video-8 tapes as source material. I found a refurbished Sony DCRTRV60 ""Digital-8"" camcorder which functions as an ideal digitizer--it plays the old analog tapes, digitizes them in-camera, and connects to Premier via a Firewire connection. Premier supports this camera, so you can use its excellent video capture module, and even control the camera from Premier--as easy as it gets.Premier doesn't recognize my DVD burner but it's easy to burn to a file and use a program that does recognize your burner to make the DVD's.The program is a joy to use. Once I figured out the difference between ""cut"" (delete key) and ""clear"" (edit menu), I was flying. (Cut removes the highlighted clip and closes the resulting gap, Clear removes the clip and keeps the gap there so you can insert something else.) Seeing and hearing the content in real time as you move the current time indicator back and forth through the timeline is priceless. The effects, audio, video and transistions, are plentiful, easily tunable, and very easy to use. I had a graduation scene that was spoiled by a gas generator rumbling away in the background. I used the audio highpass and notch filters to completely remove the generator noise while preserving the sound track. Many of my video clips needed significant color and saturation correction--just drag the clip into the timeline, trim it to suit, and tune hue-saturation by dragging sliders while watching the effect of the change in real time. (You also hear the audio filtering effect changes in real time, without which it would be impossible to fine tune something like my generator-sound-eliminator.) When I finished my production I couldn't resist showing off a bit by timing slide transitions to beats in the music--easy with the real-time jogging back and forth, and tinkering with slide durations just by dragging their edges back and forth in the timeline. This is one of those rare products that seems to come up with the perfect answer whenever you ask, ""I wonder if it can....""My final production, a DVD, looks absolutely beautiful."

12224,1,"Windows XP is the best Windows ever! I've worked with 95, 98, ME and NT, and XP totally blows them out of the water!!! I had a new Gateway computer with the horrible, worst version of Windows ever--Windows ME--on it, and I ended up losing track on how many times it gave me headaches. It seemed like when I wasn't reinstalling the operating system from the restore disks Gateway gave me, I was cursing at it left and right over how painfully slow the thing was. By the way my system has an 800 mhx processor, 384 mb of RAM, a 30 gb 7200 rpm hard drive, Nvidia TNT2 video card and Soundblaster 128d sound card. Anyway with this configuration ME was absolutely horrible, but once XP got on it, it totally revived my computer and it worked like it should. I bought the full version right on October 25th last year, did a complete formatting job of my computer to totally erase all traces of ME from my computer, installed XP along with all of my software and updates from the Internet, and a day doesn't go by that I don't thank the Lord Bill Gates helped to created this software. It's really that good! My computer has never been this quick before, and I can even install software without a hitch now. Even the upgrade to Office XP from Office 2000 worked flawlessly. Seriously, folks, this is the absolute greatest software you can have on your PC. But regretfully, I would have to say that if you're looking to buy your first pc or to upgrade your current one, then I suggest you wait until the first service pack is integrated into XP on new machines later this year. That will make XP even better than it already is, unbelievable as that may seem. But if you can't wait it will be definitely worth your while to buy a pc with XP on it and then to upgrade later this year to get the service pack. This is definitely one software purchase I do not regret buying!"
750,2,"I found this product to be a major letdown. The disappointment began with the goofy ""finger"" package (which doesn't really convey the product is a painting app), and continued with what is inside the package. I found the performance sluggish, and the program crashed on me numerous times. Also, the interface is not well designed, and I didn't find it intuitive at all. Luckily, I didn't throw down any cash for this product, as I was lucky enough to have a friend who had a copy. We were both disappointed, and are thankful that there are other, better painting products on the market these days."
8996,1,"Without getting technical, I'm pleased with the disk burning options here. The ability to produce vcr dvds is worth the price alone. I have also tried the disc spanning option and was able to save a project onto two discs. Also I am now converting videos for play on my iPod with Popcorn 2. You need a lot of hard drive space so using Toast lets me keep enough hard drive space. The toast/popcorn combo is a strong media control solution."
77831,1,"Having been a big fan of Sunbelt software I decided to try CounterSpy, since it just released version 2. I had been using one of the free programs provided by a major OS manufacture. CounterSpy did a complete scan in relatively short time, found 4 infections the free software didn't (one of which was a Trojan) and provided in depth information on the newly discovered infections.Keep in mind I have been faithfully scanning with the free software and infections got by it. So I purchased CounterSpy. It has an active protection feature that I hope will prevent further infections. But I have learned one thing. Layered protection is the only effective solution to this problem.I highly recommend the newly improved CounterSpy."
53895,1,"My son is 4 and a half and he will sit for hours playing this. Yes, at first it was a little hard to move the trucks, but once I figured it out (took about 3 minutes) and showed him, he loved it. It has tons of choices. You can choose from lots of trucks and rescue missions. You can do the same mission ten times, but by changing the vehicle, it seems like a new game every time. I disagree with the harsh reviews this game has received. Kids are different though, and what works for mine, may not work for theirs. All I can say is that my son thinks that this is the &quot;best game ever and ever&quot;!"
11514,1,Excellent product to record all the data regarding your family tree. So many features that make it worthwhile for the investment.
28290,1,"I bought Typing Instructor for Kids 3 for my 4 year old son. The product is recommended for children age 7 and up. As a result, I let him know it was available, but I really didn't expect him to touch it for a few years. I do NOT recommend children so young using any typing software, as their hands are not big enough for the keys. With that said, here is what happened... My son got sick for several days and I was running out of quiet things for him to do, so I allowed him more time on the computer. He eventually came across the Typing Instructor for Kids 3 disk and has been glued to it ever since.The program does need to be run from an administrator account when using Windows XP. Since my son knows the rules of the computer AND follows them, this wasn't a problem for me, but it might be a problem for other families.I noticed in some reviews that there were complaints about not enough rewards/games. This is due to user error, not the product. There are actually 3 islands: Explorer Island, Typer Island and Story Lagoon.Typer Island has all of the lessons and introduces the games and treasures. When you pass a lesson, you get a treasure and/or game to play. You get to set what it takes to pass a lesson - anywhere from 5 words per minute to 30 words per minute - the default is 5 WPM. This can be changed in the Settings area. You can also set the level between ""Easy"" or ""Not That Easy"" on the log-in page and Settings area. Non-beginners will want to set the difficulty level before beginning. This island is the big island in the center of the page.Explorer Island has nearly all of the games and rewards - I have found only one game that is in the castle and not on Explorer Island. Kids can repeat the games or treasures, as often as they like, using just the keys they have learned in the lessons on Typer Island or a specific lesson. This island is in the left-hand upper corner of the screen. This is the island that many other reviewers may not have been aware of - it is kind of small on the screen. There are also instructions on the Ship, that are easy to skip over, that go into all of the features of the product.Story Lagoon has books for you to type. This island is good for kids who have achieved touch-typist status. It is in the right-hand side of the screen.There is also a Results area that breaks down your accomplishments by speed, accuracy, fingers, letters, etc. It's pretty insightful.I would also recommend this product to adults who have a typing test that they need to pass. Go into the Settings area and set the passing level to 5WPM more than you need for the test and go for it. After about two days, you will find out exactly where you need to practice.When my son first started, he typed a pretty solid 3WPM. Since 5WPM is the lowest passing level this did create some frustration. The biggest hurdle to get over the frustration problem is to pass the first lesson of letters d, f, j and k. Once this lesson has been passed, one can go to Explorer Island and play all of the games. You maybe able to go to Explorer Island before passing a lesson, but we didn't notice it until after he had passed a lesson. He eventually got up to 8WPM on the games and got the courage up to try another lesson. He now has passed the entire home row and is so proud that he can type real words. All this in being home sick for 3 days from Preschool."

If you are in your twenties, you probably remember this game from school as a kid. My brother did. It's the exact same game and it looks like it and runs like it! Don't waste your money. I tossed this in the trash and today we bought a subscription to [...] the phonics one and he LOVES it!"
45387,0,Fun like all the other Backyard Baseballs but if you already have Backyard Baseball 2002 then I would say dont get it unless you are a complete fan. On the flip side there are some fun new charcters the voices are good and the gameplay can get frustrating but still fun.
63812,1,"This is my eigth year using Quicken TurboTax and it will be my sixth year using the state tax version. I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes.There is a new format this year and I'm not quite sure I like it. It could be that I'm use to the old format. However, the program still takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.I tried Taxcut in the past because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).I have to agree that the advertising included in the product (for more Intuit products) now borders on the ridiculous and the program (like all programs) needs more space and more resources each year but I still think that is better that the competition.My advice: TurboTax is still the best tax prep software. Don't do your taxes without it."
69795,1,"The City Navigator worked perfectly on our recent trip to Spain. It got every road right and found all the shortcuts. There are two issues: first, the navigator has a hard time distinguishing between the AutoVia main highways and the quaint, but ill-paved local roads. If it's shorter, it tells you to take the turnoff. Just ignore those tendencies and let it re-calculate a route on the good roads. Second, the pronounciation of the Spanish road names is quite funny. It took a while, but we figured out that ""call"" means Calle and the more complicated place names were undecipherable. All in all a wonderful product."

84493,0,"I think Norton's new AntiVirus beats McAfee for one reason: It doesn't bog down the CPU. You can run builds and keep NAV enabled and it doesn't slow you down significantly like McAfee does.One problem with NAV that I've found is that it does not seem to repair the Nimbda virus. It found the virus embedded in some zip files, though, so that may have been a special case. I can't say if it can repair executables or not -- it probably can. But I think McAfee is generally more comprehensive than NAV in repairing viruses, but it's not worth it if it's going to bog down your system...for me.One problem with all of the reviews on this page is that none of these people had an actual virus to test the product with before they wrote in a good or bad review. I HAD the Nimdba virus, and ran NAV..it simply quarantined the file. And I have McAfee 4.5 on my system at work. McAfee can definitely repair executables. So it's a mixed review, but for my money, NAV still wins the fight."

48211,1,"In one sentence I can sum up IBM OS/2 Warp V3, &quot;OS/2 Warp V3 really works!&quot; This statement is based on over 10 years of experience with OS/2 versions 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0. Warp V3 has been on 2 of my computers since 1994, running a variety of DOS, WIN3.1 and OS/2 production applications and games. OS/2 Warp V3 ran on my Thinkpad 500 for about five years with only 4MB of RAM! And it really worked! I finally upgraded to 12MB for a little more speed. OS/2 Warp V3 runs on my IBM PS/2 Model 70-486 and speed is not a problem running OS/2 or DOS programs. ONLY some WIN3.1 programs run slowly, though most run okay. Printing with OS/2 simply works, without the expected slowdowns in Windows. Doing disk maintenance simply works in the background while I work on those things which demand my more immediate attention.I run Windows 95 and 98SE on newer notebooks and desktops, as those are the only systems I could get with them, but I still prefer to use OS/2 on my older 486s! I find that I often have to reboot under Windows because of crashes while running WIN95/98 programs. OS/2 Warp just works! I might upgrade to Warp 4 some day, but Warp V3 has served me well for 7 years. It really works!"
27642,1,"I'm a total late bloomer when getting into Nancy Drew games as this one was my very first game I played here. I'm 26 almost about to be 27! Crazy. But still, despite how old this game is now (and despite my age), I still wanted to leave a review for it. First off, I altogether was a bit iffy about getting into this game and almost to the point I wasn't going to even give it a try but something kept pushing me and eventually I did. After all, it wouldn't hurt as I bought this game here (Amazon) for a cheap price. Well, I have to say I'm very glad I picked it up! xD This game was like a fun and new experience for me to play. I have never really played anything like it. What I enjoyed so much about it was the 'realistic atmosphere it offers. The game really makes you feel like a complete sleuth! You can climb through a ventilation duct, interrogate others, find secret passages etc. I LOVE it! The obvious suspense moments through it was quite interesting to encounter too. I sometimes find myself actually jumping a little if I heard a 'clang' or my heart racing a bit when somebody would be trying to come into a room I was in. Very fun! :D Though, I have one thing I didn't like so much with this game and it's kinda minor. :/ I was not too fond of the challenging puzzles you have to do through with it. Yeah... They weren't too much of my thrill. Some of the puzzles can be easy and then some can just be frustrating and annoying, leaving you to the point like 'what the heck you're supposed to do?'. You have to keep messing around or staring about until you eventually get an idea of how to solve them. You have no guide to let you know how to solve these puzzles. Well, unless you go on the internet like I did and check out a walk-through which I would only look through it for the times I got really stuck. The other times, I just tried to figure the puzzles out on my own to keep it more fun, ya know. :P Word of advice, don't look through walk-throughs unless you absolutely must DO so otherwise you may ruin the fun in the game for yourself and you wouldn't want that. Unless you're fine with it. At least I find walk-throughs to lessen the thrill in a type of game like this as it's supposed to be surprising. :PAnyway, let's get this started!Story - It was cool and straight-forward to me. It had a lot of French history going on with it. Blah Blah. But still, the story grabbed me a lot to learn more as to where the treasure was hidden and how the tower looked and who was the thief. I became hooked to playing right when I got some idea of what was going on. xDGraphics - Marvelous and very detail. I loved them! It was one of the best things about this game.Characters - They were interesting and believable to me. Though I did find Nancy Drew and her friends voices to be a bit annoying lol. xAxSounds - It was nice and sometimes scary, making you feel like you're in some horror flick. But I liked it! It was never nothing to the point where it was downright annoying that's for sure.Gameplay - It was pretty easy to get the hang of to me.I think that covers everything. If not, I'm sorry. It is late with me typing this now. :/ But I say this game is pretty cool to give a shot. You shouldn't have to spend loads of money on it as the game is old (VERY old) and you can find it cheap here on Amazon. I think anyone who loves mystery and suspense will definitely enjoy this game. This game has open the door for me to try other Nancy Drew games which I can't wait to do! :D"
40176,1,"The best way to learn a language is to figure it out for yourself with a little guidance from an expert (think about it... that's exactly what your parents did for you when you were a baby). This program does just that... you figure out what words go with what pictures and then you start deriving other words by figuring out what logically fits with what else. As you learn more, the ""puzzle"" becomes more complex, but because you are now educated in the language, it doesn't seem any more complex. It is just a natural progression that will have you speaking the language quite well within six months, provided that you practice everyday."

25663,1,"I have been a Norton user since Win 3.1 was the 'in' operating system to use.Of course you would have to expect that when initially installing Norton all the 'bells and whistles' would be in the 'on' position.This is where many of the users, 'reviewers' find fault. If you would take the time to adjust a few settings or preferences, you would find Norton will only 'pop-up' if you tell it to.I tend to forget that Norton is in my system tray until I need to use it to defrag or scan my hard drive for viruses, which it does very well.Norton also has a web site that gives you detailed information on almost any problem that might occur. They are a very helpful company.I use Norton alongside Zone Alarm. They work well together. Most people find Zone Alarm too complicated to use. Not so...I say. When you first install it, it walks you through the setup. After the inital setup and a couple more tweaks, you forget it is there. No pop-ups for this program either unless you tell it to do so.Norton's all-in-one preventive maintenance idea is the only one I will use. I have tried all the other name brand programs at one time or another and kept coming back to Norton.Do I have any cons for Norton? Yes, it needs a more detailed web clean-up and tweaking feature. I like adjusting preferences to fit my needs and there could be more of it on the web preferences."
7657,1,"My first impression of this new release is positive - the new centers provide concise information in a snap shot manner that is very easy to use. As a Mac user I have been running QB Premier 2005 in Virtual PC environment for a year or so with no problems. The upgrade to 2006 is a bit more challenging. When you try to run the main ""setup.exe"" I received an immediate error message and the install program crashed. The ""work-around"" to this is to open the folder on the CD called ""QBOOKS"" and run the ""setup.exe"" program in the folder. For whatever reason that one works in Virtual PC while the other one does not. Intuit will not support Virtual PC questions so don't even waste your time on hold... good luck."
23605,1,"I've been using FileMaker since version 3 -- and this new Version 6 retains its user-friendly interface and commands. But the big improvement is in speed - the speed with which the application launches and the speed at which database files open -- much, much faster than in version 5.0 (in Windows XP and in Windows 98)! Otherwise, I'm still exploring. The only frustration I've come upon is that this version of FileMaker does not include a list of recently opened files in the File Menu (the option to do this is greyed out). Instead you can access a list of recently opened files from an arrow next to the ""Open File"" icon -- only after you have already opened a document file. V-e-r-r-r-y strange.I cannot fathom what some other reviewer meant when he refered to FileMaker's ""draconian"" upgrade policies. Does he expect them to give it away for free? The upgrade price -- especially with the $$ rebate that brings it down to $$-- is quite reasonable for a program of this power and sophistication. It's FileMaker's support policy that disappoints, but then again the entire software industry seems to have moved in this direction (free support for installation and getting started; one free support call thereafter). Fortunately with FileMaker Pro, you rarely need to call technical support, the program is that easy to learn and use. It actually comes with a printed manual!"

This software has a lot of quirks. For example, it automatically capitalizes such words as Outlook and Ridge. I have spent quite a bit of time trying to train"" this software. Perhaps I would get better results if I had a different sound card or more internal memory. I still enjoy using this program and hope that the accuracy will continue to improve.

84327,0,"I guess history really does repeat itself. For the past ten years or so, all of Microsoft's ""new products"" look and act very similar to the previous version to the point where one has to wonder why we bother upgrading.So it is with VISTA Ultimate. It does have a bit of a slick new look and adding ""gadgets"" on the side is a nice, friendly touch - but that hardly would qualify this as a five-year-in-the-making creation. As Windows really operates in the background, it means that you don't notice Vista anymore than you noticed the earlier versions. Startup looks a bit different and the START button, or so I have been told, is now called, ""The Pearl"" but you don't need a tutorial to figure anything out. That is OK but the fact that there are no visible improvements is a bit of a set-back.There is, however, a big problem that I faced. Several products are not Vista ready even though they are new on the market. Drivers have been promised so it is just a matter of waiting but I am a long-time McAfee user and they said their products are not compatible to Vista 64 bit. OK. I went to Microsoft for Live and their product is only compatible with Vista 32 bit. Excuse me but how on earth can you sell a product that is not ready to provide users with internet security? Or, better still, how can you not create your own internet security system for the product you sell? Strange.So, as we will all have Vista as it will be loaded on all future machines, you'll use it and, once some of the kinks are ironed out, you probably won't even notice it. Until then . . ."

The price is about right if you are just getting started with color calibration.The basic Huey device is easy setup and use, but I don't really use the auto light adjustment. It's small enough to take with you if you use a laptop (in fact it's always in my laptop bag). If you are going to use it with a laptop, then I think it's the perfect buy, but if you are going to use it with a permanent desktop setup you might want to consider the pro setup since there isn't a huge price difference."

32691,1,"The software works pretty well with my Etrex Vista. Not all trails are marked on the map, even some quite popular ones. Some logging roads are also missing. However the topographic information makes it easy to orient yourself. The city maps are quite detailed although not many of the roads are named. The biggest drawback that i have noticed so far is that you cannot download the fully detailed maps to your PC hard drive. The very generic instruction manual suggests that this is possible but I contacted Garmin and was told that this feature is not enabled for this product. This means that you have to carry the disks with you and load them every time you want to view them which is incovenient especialy if you travel with a laptop(and if you lose/damage the disks you are SOL). The maps use quite a bit of memory and take a while (20 minutes or more for a large mapset)to download to the gps unit (old serial cable technology). I cannot load more than about 30% of the state of Oregon onto my 24MB vista so I have to be selective. One nice bonus of a topo map/vista combination is that you can use the map to calibrate your altimeter/barometer."

37588,1,"I installed it and it worked, mostly. The original 6.0 is admittedly buggy. Once you down load the latest patch from the McAfee web site, it's fine. This does not bother me for two reasons. First, who on the planet has ever had dealings with a Microsoft product that was perfect the first time? There are hardly any pieces of software that are 100% bug free in version x.0. That's why reputable vendors have Web sites and patches. If you have spent any amount of time in the computer world you know what I mean. There is nothing like getting a service pack for you NOS that makes things worse and takes down 500 some hosts. It happens. Now, if the vendor doesn't have a patch, okay we have a problem.Second, this is an advanced piece of software. This ain't no Ford Pinto. We're talking about a Lamborghini. If you want that kind of power and performance, you may have to deal with a bit of tweaking. But the results are awesome.Now I hear you whining &quot;But I don't want to buy a product that I have to service immediately.&quot; As soon as you bought a computer, this is what you get. Don't like it? Buy a toaster!Most problems I have seen users run into are because they either A} are the 1 in 1000 people who are going to have a problem with whatever they try to run B} Don't get the patch C} are running Norton.Now, C is interesting. McAfee stuff won't work with Norton, and Norton won't work with McAfee. I'm mad now! You mean to tell me I can't run my Windows version of Word on a Mac! This is what software companies do to keep away competition. You have to commit to either McAfee or Norton. They can't and won't play together and that is the way BOTH of them want it. If you have Norton currently and want to go to McAfee, or want to mix the two, understand you must choose one or the other. It's like a bad soap opera. Don't get mad at a software product because of industry convention. Deal with it and choose what team you want to be on.Great software. Buy it. Love it. Keep the bugs away."

I only have 2 system's at home and I needed 2 servers and 1 client workstation to complete some of the lab exercises in my Windows 2000 Server lab book. Well instead of purchasing a new system or building one from scratch I decided to purchase this product based on a recommendation from a friend who is also in the IT field and to my amazement I was very impressed.

92886,1,"I remember the first time I used WordPerfect, and the first time I used Microsoft Word. I couldn't imagine why anyone would choose the vastly inferior Word over WordPerfect.Years passed, and now I find myself using MS Word every day. I'd been ground down by the thousands of Word users who'd picked it up along with PowerPoint and Excel, and who didn't have enough savvy to know how to convert documents from one format to another. WordPerfect _always_ converted MSWord docs. MSWord never reciprocated. Shouldn't that have told them which program had a mandate to make the customer's life that much easier? With each successive iteration, WordPerfect introduced some new innovation, and in the next incarnation, Microsoft aped it. It got to the point where users would nod appreciatively at the innovation, then wait the inevitable year-long interval for Microsoft to catch up, and then they'd buy that.Well, due to an outrageously fair price point and multiuser license, I tried WordPerfect X3, and it was like coming home. It's nothing short of amazing. I went out and bought a copy for my parents, and they love it, too. Now my brother, an attorney, has asked me to buy him a copy, since so many of the federal prosecutors he works with have WordPerfect only, and can't seem to open his Word files.

46537,0,"I wanted to use TOPO to map the trails in the parks around South Eastern VA. by importing the GPS tracks obtained from walking/riding the trails. TOPO would almost do what I wanted, but its disappointing lack of editing and viewing tools made it impossible to accurately draw or display the routs.If I import the tracks as individual waypoints, the waypoints are displayed as HUGE diamonds on the map that overlap and make it impossible to follow the track. The max zoom is insufficient to clearly display the tracks, but the magnify option zooms in nicely. The only problem is the magnify option also magnifies the waypoint icons, so they still overlap. For the Mid-Atlantic map, these waypoint diamonds are about 200 feet corner to corner.If I bring the tracks in as complete routs, there is no way to make small changes to fit the track to the minor inconsistencies in the elevation map. For example, when the GPS shows me walking a mostly flat section and TOPO has me descending into a ravine; if I remember navigating around the edge of the ravine, it's obvious the track in that area needs to be tweaked to miss the ravine. I might be able to draw a new track if the lines of the existing track were a little thinner, but as with the waypoints, at max magnify the lines are very thick and obscure the topo lines. When I try to start a new track, the draw tool functions as a track selector over the existing (too thick) track, so I can't correct what is already there. The only option is to delete small sections of the map and try to redraw them from memory or a print out. This process might work, but I think I could do it a lot faster in a paint program.There doesn't seem to be any way to turn off a waypoint or track display completely, since all the waypoints are ultimately displayed in the &quot;All Waypoints&quot; master list which won't turn off. Strangely, if I delete a waypoint in a custom rout, the waypoint is also deleted from the master list, so once a waypoint is added to a rout it can't be removed without also removing it from the entire map.Overall it's a nice program and probably works fine for mapping out long, straight paths. It's useless for my purposes, though. They need to add some better editing and viewing features, such as interactive rout editing with drag handles on the waypoints, and some control over how and when the waypoints are displayed."

And with Microsoft releasing a weekly update that includes more of all these features, there's no claim that internet sites are more current.

315,1,"I'm now in a program learning to be an interpreter, but I started out with this dvd program to see if I would enjoy sign language. Although some people would disagree with some of the signs (I had a deaf guy look at me like I'm crazy when I signed a few things), I still think it provides a very thorough knowledge of sign language. It's very hard to learn this from a dvd program because language is a two-way street. You have to speak it (or sign it) and you have to understand it when it's spoken back (or signed back.) This dvd does everything possible to help learn both directions. When I entered my very first sign language class, I knew almost every sign they taught us because of this program.The deaf guy who looked at me like I'm crazy was from another part of the USA, and I'm told that signing can be different in different parts of the country. And just like our language evolves all the time, especially slang, this one evolves and changes MUCH faster.If your interest continues beyond the basics, I would strongly recommend enrolling in a class at your local community college. It's really fun!"
15752,1,"First, I have never had problems with the kinds of bugs reported here. The patches make things only better, but when I read the kinds of fixes the patches address, I can say that I have not seen most, if any, of them.Second, the fact that I'm pro-Final Draft 7 does not make me anti-Movie Magic Screenwriter. In fact, I've agonized about buying both programs, just to be covered. I have sampled the MMS demo, and what I don't like about it is that the interface is a far cry from the MS Word style that is claimed. Final Draft 7 mirrors the Windows XP interface, and when the you've set the font display to maximum resolution, it looks beautiful.Third, Final Draft 7 makes the art of screenplay writing addictive (not that MMS doesn't). As you get yourself immersed in the process, you can find it hard to pull yourself away.Fourth, Final Draft offers a special pricing policy for military customers (of course, I can use the MMS competitive upgrade policy and save even more). I contacted Write Brothers both by phone and e-mail about a military pricing policy, and received conflicting information. By e-mail, I was told that they have a military pricing policy. Why they don't publicize this on their web site is beyond me. When I called them, however, I was told that no such pricing policy exists, and that if I was looking to save money, I should try Amazon or other sites.Personally, I love Final Draft. I'm looking for a reason to also add MMS to my software suite, but I haven't seen enough reasons (yet) to take the plunge."

12913,1,"Windows XP has been dubbed by Microsoft to be the biggest Windows release since Windows 95. Microsoft has hit the nail head on with that statement. Windows XP is also has some major improvements and features which is good and bad.Windows Product Activation (wpa)Windows Product Activation is a new feature Microsoft is adding to it's new line of Operation System XP. The idea in theory is that it will help cut down on software piracy. Windows XP will be like Shareware in that you have a certain amount of time to use it before you have to activate your copy with the company. The difference is, Microsoft has made the activation extremely difficult to bypass and will cut down on piracy. When you install XP you will be asked to activate, by clicking yes, it will send the Product key you used to install the software and check it in the database to see if its been used before and by another computer. If you buy a new computer you will have to get a new Product ID number from Microsoft. This part of Activation is a mistake because if your like me, I build my own computers and replace them every few months to a year or so which means I have to contact Microsoft everytime to get a new ID.LUNALuna is the new interface in XP. The greenish Start Button and blue Taskbar have given XP a nicer and smoother look. If you don't like the colors then you are free to change them or use another theme. XP has better theme support and will allow you to fully customize your computer to the look you want. Another great feature about XP new interface is ability to customize folders in such a way you could of never done with the previous versions of Windows. For an example. If you have a folder full of pictures and your not sure which picture is which and you don't want to open them all up to find the one your looking for. All you have to do is: On your Tool bar is a view opinion. Select Thumnails. This will show all of your pictures in Thumnails preview. You can also group your pictures by name or by letters.Networking / Internet SecurityWhen it comes to Home or Work Networking, XP delivers a knockout. XP comes with some amazing tools to help you configure your network without using expensive programs on the internet. Just follow the step by step wizard and your done. When talking about a network theres nothing more important then security. Lets face it, since I got my high speed connection, I have been scanned at least 3 times a day by someone looking for an open port on my computer to connect to. Microsoft XP protects you from this by featuring a built in Firewall. The firewall for the most part works great.CLOSING THOUGHTI have also learned of a new feature that will be built in to XP. Its a video tutorial to help beginners and even the novice Windows user to maximize his or her computer. Theres no need to buy a book on XP. The books is included in the tour and why read boring pages when you can see a video showing you every step of the way. Microsoft is really out doing themeselves and I am looking forward to the final version of XP which is due to hit stores on Oct. 25."
88012,1,"If you download this to a pen drive you can have your very own abject nonsense on a stick! The amusingly named Lau ""Scientific"" are performing a valuable service in allowing people to look up what fatuous ""remedy"" a homeopath would ""prescribe"" without exposing themselves to the anti-science nonsense the homeopath will give them to go with it, thus reducing the chance they will suffer heath damage due to actually believing this twaddle.I'm assuming the software is just a random number generator, since there is no objective way of distinguishing homeopathic ""remedies"" other than by label, and no evidence at all showing that one produces any different effect from another. So potential buyers could go one better and either stick a pin in a copy of the ""materia medica"" or write their own randomiser. Still, not everyone has access to the ""materia medica"" (it may be in your library under ""fantasy"") or the programming skills to write software, so this will do for them.The essential companion to this isBad Science: Quacks, Hacks, and Big Pharma Flacksby Ben Goldacre, though Oliver Wendell Holmes'Homeopathy and its Kindred Delusionsis also interesting as a valid debunking of the nonsense of homeopathy during Hahnemann's own lifetime - none of his points are refuted 170 years later, which is rather good."

38036,1,"Since video biterate and audio bitrate are the tough elements in the DVD copy precedure, DVDxp4 is a tool that can do them all if the player knows how to select the right force 24KHz in the input DVD source template. This force will adjust the stable clock cycle for each DVD source format, 4/3 or 16/9 for example. As a result, copying DVD movie to SVCD from a CD burner is the best process of DVDxp4. However, to play this SVCD the player needs to look for the right and new home DVD player. The new DVD Sumsung S221 I am using is a correct player that can go forward or reverse easily when playing this SVCD. The other DVD player may or may not read this SVCD format. PowerCDR Express is also a best tool because it forces to stop the process when encoutering a wrong code that is inserted onto the DVD source. This stop is a good precedure to save a CD-R. The player needs to change VBR and the length of movie on a CD-R to skip this wrong code when using this DVDxp4."
28577,0,"My 6-yr-old daughter received this game as a gift and we found it to be fairly disappointing. It keeps jamming up, the graphics aren't great, and it's annoying that Barbie has to change her outfit whenever she wants to switch between ""stealth"" mode, for example, and ""action"" mode. My daughter hardly ever plays this game and prefers Barbie Explorer for its faster and more exciting pace."

37709,1,"TC Mac Pro V2 is well worth the price if you are looking for a low cost highly capable drafting/modeling program for the Mac. I was very surprised to see how many features it had. Snaps, Layers, Symbols, 3D symbols, Bill of materials, multiple scales, it's all there.Coming from an AutoCAD background ther was a learning curve, but not that long of a curve. You can find video tutorials with the ViaCAD series of demos from punch software. TC Mac is closely related to ViaCAD Pro except it does not have the ability to apply materials to models (yet) or the cost of a few extra hundreds of dollars."
37098,1,"This is a great little program to get introduced to Danish-- the graphics are colorful and appealing and it hardly feels like you are &quot;studying&quot; vocabulary. If you are trying to decide between this and the Rosetta Stone software, all I can say is they're different. EuroTalk's software is DEFINITELY more fun (also has better graphics and is more user-friendly). However, Rosetta Stone's program teaches you more sentence structure and phrases (EuroTalk's focuses mainly on single words), and also lets you type to practice spelling/listening skills. I also like the recording feature better in the Rosetta Stone one too, because it actually maps out your speech pattern against that of the native speaker, and &quot;rates&quot; on how closely you matched it (isn't always accurate though). Wish there was more vocabulary in each of these programs... you go through them pretty quickly. If I had to choose between the two programs........well I'd pick &quot;Talk Now!&quot; because it is simply more enjoyable, and it feels like I am learning much faster using it. But I'd actually recommend getting both if you can, to give you a broader education of the language. Get the &quot;Talk Now!&quot; first though, then go on to the Rosetta Stone one afterwards."
91297,1,"This software saved my [self] twice. I run Windows ME with Linux on my laptop. So during a new Linux install I had re-image my disk. Whew! That was a close one. I tried other imaging software such as Ghost, Acronis True Image, but they fall short. In fact I had an Acronis True Image saved image I wanted to use to reimage my disk but it failed. So I had reach back a couple months more when I used Drive Image to get my restoration. I would give five stars but it does not support my cd burner when I wanted to burn image to cd. I also found not many image software support Firewire or external disk. You can image active drive and save backup image to another drive and later put that image to firewire to save but during restoration you are booting in dos mode you won't be able to get that image from firewire drive. For you novice, learn how to do this and this ability will definitely save you. It's like turning the clock back."

49983,1,"For those of you who may be reluctant to buy an upgrade for over one hunded dollars, I tell this ain't some broken windows or locked gates, even if you don't have the latest intel dual core, there are many features and upgraded ideas that prove that apple was the first personal computer, and MS is a failure of innovation, customer response, and non monopoly ideas. What makes this so much better than an XP to Vista robbery, is that even regular OS actions are smoother, more refined, and the little things make a greater-than-the-sum-of -its-parts upgrade. Go 10.5 for better peripheral integration, cross platform compatibility, and spaces, time machine, and preview just prove the most technically hot OS is still the best GUI in front of an open standard and much more than Bill could steal in the 80's and 90's.

48616,1,"DreamWeaver Rocks. Fireworks Rocks. Together they make for a spectacular web design/development combination.Dreamweaver is packed with features for the beginner through advanced web developer; it's easy and intuitive to use. It may take you a while to learn all the capabilities, but with each successive feature you discover and master, the development process becomes easier and faster.Fireworks is the best in class web graphics software. It integrates very well with DreamWeaver. Creating animated GIFs is a snap, as is image optimization (file compression), image map creation, and exploring full tables (HTML and all!) for use in DreamWeaver.You simply cannot go wrong with this package. Photoshop still has its place, but if you focus exclusively on the web and don't need to do exquisite image editing this bundle is all you need."

Unless you have a ""photographic"" memory, it's impossible to remember the hundreds of options and various settings for the D300. It is advisable to read the Nikon manual first, then the CheatSheet is even quicker to use and will jog your memory when you're out with your camera. This is not a substitute for being familiar with the camera, but can avoid a lot of frustration trying to find one particular setting. Really nothing to lose by adding this to your camera bag. Note that this CheatSheet is for the D300, not the D200 as the product description indicated."

17330,1,"I purchased this product for my parents who know little about computers because it provides everything to keep their PC up and running, while doing almost all the work in the background without you even noticing. Virus, spyware, defragmentation; everything to protect their PC.The only flaw is the backup tools. Even in the updated version 1.5 (I am running a not final beta mode on my computer) the backup software is not very useful. You cannot backup to a second internal hard drive, only to external hard drives or dvds, and you cannot pick and choose the files you want to back up very well. For instance, you choose categories of things you want to backup, ie: pictures. However, the program cannot pick and choose say just your family photos, it takes every picture on your computer, including the many built into Windows.This is a great program for protecting your PC, but its not perfect. If you are looking for an all-in-one security service this is it."

53007,1,"This program retails for less than $100. Don't expect it to be used by Steven Spielberg. I bought it several years ago in an Office Max because I was in a hurry to put together a crude edit of a home movie. However, from the day I started using it up until now, I continue to be impressed with its capabilities, ease of use, and reliability. I keep discovering new features, and am yet to outgrow it after creating about half a dozen pretty ambitious home movies.I am retired now, but when employed as a software engineer, my specialty was user interface. I am very critical of poor interfaces. Video Explosion got it right. The ability to introduce and edit transitions and special effects on the timeline is excellent. Menus are clear, and provide good clues to drilling down to extra features. The help facility is first rate. And, most importantly, the program seems to be bug free.I have not used any higher end video software, so my perspective is limited. I am not a pro, but I work very hard to make my home movies as professional looking as possible. For the price paid, this package continues to impress me, and certainly to fill my needs. In that sense, it is like my bicycle (a pro level Trek) - the tool is still much better than the user."

I found it very helpful, because once you get to one point, everything comes together. I was very intrigued by the thought of this game, and enjoyed being able to go wherever I pleased without having to switch CDs (See Secrets can Kill). It is a fun and exciting game that you won't want to walk away from."
20723,1,"After getting the hang of this product I can highly recommend it. I expected a linear series of lessons, like an animated textbook, and so I was slightly bewildered by this program at first. A little experimentation, however, soon yields great results.What you get is 4 &quot;titles&quot;, multimedia chapters of a few thousand words each consisting of text and some video (two titles are entirely video based). Basically, it's up to you to make your way through this content at your own pace. The software makes this very easy since each word and sentence is playable individually, pronounced in a clear voice (separate from the video soundtrack), and is playable at multiple speeds. The meaning of each word and sentence is displayed at the bottom as you read or play it, along with a grammatical breakdown. This line-by-line reading and viewing is the core of the program. The quality of the video is excellent - interesting and humorous (Andr&eacute;s visits Spain, Puerto Rico and Colombia clumsily filming advertisements).Once you've made your way though a title (or a section within a title), you can then move on to the other activities - crosswords and 7 other games and exercises, generated dynamically from the sections you are comfortable with. The dynamic nature of the activities gives them almost infinite reusability and they are almost addictive. After completing a section I look forward to the games as a fun test.After that, you can use the pronunciation tools. The software analyses your voice in a variety of ways, but I don't put too much stock in it except as an good way to get you to record and listen to yourself.Finally a few extra tools allow you to keep custom lists of words to learn, make grammatical notes, etc. These lists can be imported into an accompanying flashcard program. My only complain is that you can (no longer?) export the lists as text for use elsewhere - what gives?Overall I'm pleased with this purchase - and I've tried the competition. My only caveat is this software is probably not suited for the rank beginner, a basic grounding in the grammar and vocabulary would make this program more productive for you. They do not make this clear on the packaging, though."

I've about $5,000 in darkroom equipment upstairs, which is for sale. Adobe Photoshop Elements, for about a hundred bucks, made it all obsolete.""Elements"" is a misnomer.

26965,2,"Based on lots of great reviews, I decided to buy Kaspersky. After two months, I got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted. I sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours. Finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key. This did not work. I had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply. This time, no one ever replied. I sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still, weeks later, have not replied. I emphatically advise against buying this product. If you ever have a problem, you will not get help."

He takes things one at a time and doesn't waste it either.The Hare on the other hand is busy and always on the move and is kind of a braggart (And I say it in a loving way) but loveable anyway.One day the Tortoise is listening to the birds sing and the Hare thinks that the Tortoise leds a boring life. And then that afternoon they meet again.And the Hare starts teasing him again. And by now the Tortiose is getting tired of being made fun of and tells the Hare that he can move pretty fast sometimes and so the Hare challenges him to a race.And when the race comes Who do you think wins the race? Buy this Living Book to find out!Oh and there are lots of funny gags like on page 5 if you click on one of the buildings a mouse appears and calls to his friend who's a hippo and asks him does he want to play catch. And the hippo says ""Sure. Catch me"" and the hippo lands on the mouse and the mouse picks him up and carries him away (That's a strong mouse). That was such a HOOT! Kids laugh out loud at these gags I'm sure of it!I NEVER get tired of these gags their SO funny! Also don't forget to find the dragonfly that's hidden on every page!"
31322,1,"This disk has every Fantastic Four issue ever made, readable with the Adobe viewer. It's easy to use and magnify. These issues are NOT ""proofs"" from Marvel archives; they're actual scanned comics from someone's collection. As such, many pages on older issues are stained a bit, or wrinkled, or chipped, but this does not affect color and readability. It's very amusing to read the ads from the early 1960s issues: muscle-building courses, transistor radios, hypno-coins!!The Fantastic Four was conceived, written and drawn by the magnificent team of Stan Lee/Jack Kirby. (That's why I bought this disk.) Simultaneously, they also wrote/drew/edited the Avengers, Spiderman, Hulk. I don't know how they did it, they were true geniuses. I love the Letters pages in the early issues. Stan Lee is as bombastic and hammy as ever!"
65812,1,"It's not that good but it's not that bad either. First the downsides. First,What kind of conscience rips off pages from famous books just to make up a new game? Second,the doorsknobs should'nt have introduce us the all the stars of the game. WE ALREADY KNOW WHO THEY ARE! Third,on the Alice level we see Alice with no head and still standing alive. YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT A HEAD!!! THAT""S IMPOSSIBLE!!!! IT'S KINDERGARDEN SCIENCE!!! NOT TO MENTION IT WILL SCARE THE EVER-LOVING HECK OUT OF EVERYONE PLAYS THIS GAME!!! Forth,The Ringmaster isn't a real villain,more like a comic foil. Now the upsides. The levels are challenging and the stages are stylish. The best level of 4 is the Peter Pan where you actually get into a swordfight with Captain Hook. The last level is the most challenging becuase you have to fight all the 4 villains. One at a time maybe but still. While having some flaws,it's still a fun game to play. I give this game a 7 out of 10."
77552,1,"This product does what is otherwise impossible: shrinks a partition without disturbing the data therein. Also it works very fast! It takes just a minute or two to shrink or expand a partition.It has always worked for me. If you wonder why you would need this software, don't worry about it. If you need it, believe me, you know it. And when you need it, this is the only program on earth that will do this work.When you need it and it works it is AWESOME!Here's an example:Say you have a teaching lab with 8 computers. You want to use Power Quest Drive Image to create a clone of the hard disk on computer #1 on CD. Then every Friday night after class you can restore the image on all 8 computers and Monday morning all your computers are fresh and ready, regardless of what last week's students did.Computer #1 has a 100 GB hard drive in a single partition, but only 1GB is actually in use. The rest is free space. Since Drive Image backs up a partition at a time, you will need enough CDs to hold 100GB of compressed data, even though most of it will just be zeros. That might take you many CDs. What you need is a way to shrink the partition size down to just the 1GB in use. Conventional tools will not allow you to do this....they erase all the data in the partition if you shrink it. That kills you! That forces you to back up all the data to another hard drive, delete the partition, recreate the partition to the 1GB size, then format the partition, then reload the data from the spare hard drive, if possible, then create your Drive Image CD, and then go to through the whole process again to expand the partition back. This could take all day.With Partition Magic, you just insert a diskette and about two minutes later you are done shrinking the partition to the needed size! Snap your image CD and then fire up Partition Magic again and in another two minutes the partition is back where it started! With this technology available doing it the old way makes about as much sense as using a Radio Shack cassette tape player for data storage on your IBM-PC instead of a hard drive.The former owner of this program, Power Quest, was granted several patents on this technique. Check it out at www.uspto.gov - it's fascinating reading. Paraphrasing their words: obviously this function is not easy since it took 15 years from the introduction of the IBM-PC for someone to invent it."
16759,2,I remember playing this when I was a kid. I bought it so I can relive the past again but it will not install. Sadly
93425,1,"The 2006 version of NIS is by far the best security suite I have used for my computer. It is much better than its 2005 version. Installation was quick and easy and although they require you to pay for customer support I was able to get my questions answered free of charge by using the chat option on their website. The firewall is what really sold me on NIS 2006. It is much better than the ordinary one offered with windows. As for virus removal, it did all the work for me. While online, NIS popped up with a message saying a couple of files on my computer had been infected. I was prometed to do a full system scan, the files were found and deleted automatically. Previous versions had required me to do the removal process manually. I have had it since late October and my computers performance has not declined at all. Overall great product."
5953,2,"I switched to TaxCut this year for the usual reasons, and so far am very unimpressed after trying to get started after just one day. Here's why:1. The update is over 14MB that needs to be downloaded.2. The auto-update locked up when I tried to run it twice.3. The non-auto update file locked up during installation the first time I ran it.4. TaxCut Deluxe keeps giving errors trying to import my TurboTax file. It took me 20 minutes to get the TaxCut customer support guy to understand the issue. He was very insulting, kept interrupting and kept trying to give me advice that did not apply. FINALLY he asked a supervisor and gave me a very non-detailed suggestion involving going back into TurboTax and re-saving the file after hitting radio button 1 (which he couldn't tell me anything else about except that it is radio button 1!).5. (minor) The program makes me save my tax info before doing anything even though I haven't put a single thing into it yet.6. They would not give me tech support without giving them all sorts of personal information (they even asked for my internet provider!).7. According to tech support, you have to turn off virus checking software to install or use TaxCut.All in all, very unprofessional, poorly designed, lousy tech support, and after just one day trying to get started I'm really annoyed."

64948,1,"for the price, the gains in workflow are incredible. the ability to completely circumvent the memory car and see the pictures on the full sized computer screen are well worth the asking price. just make sure you get a long enough usb cable, I myself procured a 15 ft usb extension cable in anticipation of this product.onto my reviewthe software is a lil sluggish compared to iphoto or photoshopCS2 at actually batch processing conversions. What really makes this software worth the money however is the camera control software. through the usb cable (assuming you upgrade the firmware to version 2.0) you can cotrol all the settings on the camera and use it as a remote shutter. This is absoloutly ideal in a studio environment where you get the most efficient workflow possible. This extends to the field assumng you have a laptop.to get the maximum use of this sotware aside from the camera itself(duh)I highly reccomend the followingAC adapter -(usb tends to drain the batteries on my d70 not asoloutly neccessary but useful in an indoor studio)extra batteries - (see above)tripod - to take advantage of software controllerlaptop - (take your workflow anywhere)usb extension cable - the longer the better"

63334,1,"The installer has changed significantly in the 8.x series. It feels wierd to me because it's trying to mimic a more www feel, it worked flawlessly though.The package manager is significantly improved. It enables you to resolve package conflicts (it's like fixing DLL conflicts before they happen, for you Windows users) using a tree view depicting paths to resolve the conflict. It's confusing at first, but I'm getting used to it. The search option for packages works much faster and the interface for that part is greatly simplified.I was shocked to find that the GNOME configuration in this release seemed far more stable than in Red Hat 8.0, since Red Hat are dedicated to GNOME and SuSE is dedicated more to KDE.Unlike other reviewers, I find SuSE's frequent releases to be a blessing. If I buy every release, it's still cheaper than broadband (I hesitate to pay $50/month) and keeps my linux system very current.My only complaint is that the Java Development Kit included is a bit old. It's version 1.3.1 when the current is 1.4.1. Oh well, still deserves 5 stars."

We are really enjoying this software. A bit about how it works, there are 4 exquisite photographs with a phrase for each that is spoken by a native speaker. The lessons build upon themselves; so you consistently review what has already been covered. This program is the best way we have found to study Danish."
44729,1,"We traveled all around Hungary with this. I bought the SD Card and installed it on my Garmin before we left the US. I was not sure if it installed right, but as soon as we got into our rental car, it found our location and gave excellent instructions. There is instruction available on dozens of languages. We used the English and was amused by the pronunciation of street names. One detail I wish I paid more attention to, was to set my preferences before we got on the road: On the way from Lake Balaton I forgot to set to avoid the ferry and it wanted to turn us around for about 25 miles, once it accepted that we will not do things his way, it took us into the myriads of villages instead of taking us to the major highway. - It did this a few times during our trip before I went and set preferences. Other than this it was an excellent guide and would have been quite lost without it. Considering the price of regional maps, this was a cheap investment."

79432,1,"I have used DeLorme Street Atlas for years in my genealogical hobby. I have found it amazing that it has so much detail of both urban and rural roads, and also topographical features. Used in combination with a GPS and DeLorme Atlas and Gazetters, I have been able to locate drive directly to many obsecure locations."
80649,1,"iWork consists of three apps, PAGES, NUMBERS & KEYNOTE.PAGES: While being billed as a word processor, it really is a mini page layout app that has word processing features. It has dozens of classy, elegant templates from business letters to flyers to brochures. If you want to create a newsletter, other than the typing, a few clicks will bring in your photos and you are set to go. Comparing the stark ugly templates in MS Office and the fact they are weird & wonky to use is NOTHING like your new experience with PAGES. MS Office templates are is changing a tire by the freeway in the rain while PAGES is driving in a convertible on a sunny autumn day.And to carry the pleasure & pain analogy further, KEYNOTE is flat out the best presentation software while Powerpoint is a visit to the dentist - necessary but hardly anyone looks forward to it. The only problem is that most people are stuck using Powerpoint without a choice but if you have a choice, KEYNOTE isn't just day and night but while Word is a fine app, just not very exciting, Word templates are like changing a tire in the rain ... Powerpoint is changing a tire in the rain while a thousand ball peen hammers work you over as you do it. KEYNOTE is sitting at a cafe drinking a cappucino. And on top of that, it's so classy and elegant that you can't really mess it up ... no pink and bright green templates.NUMBERS on the surafce does not seem particularly exciting - after all, it's a spreadsheet app. It is a mini Excel, but that's not necessarily a knock if you don't need the 1,000 features of Excel & ESPECIALLY the major flaw of Excel is that its charting while plentiful are fairly unattractive looking. In NUMBERS, you can create great looking charts, place a photo underneath in about two clicks. You can also move cells as objects around just by dragging them around - again, like PAGES - elegant & classy looking are really just a few clicks away. Unlike PAGES though, you do not get that many templates - the ones included are all nice or downright gorgeous though. THERE IS NO WAY you can match the design and presentation aspects of NUMBERS in Excel and I've been using EXCEL since version 1.0. For power users, macro writers and DB front end, and major number crunchers - Excel still is the main choice but if your needs are more towards standalone spreadsheet but in particular - number oriented presentations and making checklists, NUMBERS is great. NUMBERS also requires a little learning curve (a few weeks) since it offers all of Excel's most popular features but requires a little time to learn where they are in NUMBERS. Again, like PAGES, NUMBERS is a presentation & layout app disguised as a spreadsheet.MS Office is great for corporations, a thousand features - lots of macros and customization for the IT department. It's a fine functional app (well, other than Powerpoint) - iWork is really a subset of that - the features that a small business, a club, an organization, church group or a consultant who does presentation pitches wants that looks good, runs fast and is easy to use ... that's iWork.But if you want to create flyers, newsletters and have access to dozens of classy & elegant templates ... and you want the best presentation app around - iWork at @$75 is a great deal."
68227,1,"I don't get it. Nowhere on the packaging for this game does it say its the original arcade version of Centipede, so how is that something to complain about...?Having said that, I once had a demo version of this, and played it for hours. Unfortunatly, the disc wouldn't load into my newer PC, and I thought it was off to the same black hole as After Dark, Jill of the Jungle, Lemmings, etc.Recently I found the CD ROM for this, case intact, at a thrift store. I'm so glad I did, too. Its a fun shoot-em-up game, with multiple levels and worlds to make your way through. I'm not a 'gamer'; I play games online for short periods of time and then get bored. But, this one is a different story. Well recommended."
15149,1,I love this! Great deal... low price and it allows me to keep track of my bills. Works great in Vista! :)
55974,1,"I also got my first copy of this game from a cereal box. I figured it was going to be similar to Oregon Trail. It was, or at least as similar as exploring the Amazon River can be to traversing North America.Anyway, it was fun, challenging, and educational, which for a cereal box game is a pretty tall order.The replay value isn't particularly high, since the ""native interaction"" scenes are fairly static, and the river is the same size and shape no matter how many times you travel it. But be careful not to starve or die of any of the dozens of exotic diseases, or else you WILL be replaying it--several times. And for goodness' sake, try very hard not to hit the riverbanks.The graphics were cool for their time. Now they're fake-looking...but who cares? The gameplay is what's important. And that's still good."
45536,0,"I have several hundred movies I have taped over the years on VHS tapes and decided I wanted to transfer some of them to DVD before they started to deteriorate so I purchased the Turtle Beach Video Advantage USB.The first consideration you should make in purchasing this device is whether your computer will be able to support the heavy demands of the Video Advantage USB (and transferring VHS to DVD in general). I had recently purchased an HP Pavilion Laptop with Intel Duo Core T7200 2.0 GHz processor, 2 GB RAM and an 80 GB 5400 RPM hard drive. The laptop has done admirably in the capture process even though my hard drive is below the recommended 7200 RPM. You may want to consider the advice in the users manual to purchase a separate hard drive dedicated to video capturing. The size of the captured files is quite large (up to 10 GB for a 2 hour movie) so make sure you have adequate hard drive space and the hard drive is not highly fragmented. I would not even consider running the Video Advantage USB on my older Dell Dimension with a P4 1.8 GHz processor and 1 GB RAM. Also beware -- Video Advantage USB does not ""officially"" work on Vista (although the Turtle Beach site has some sort of work around listed).The actual Video Advantage USB has worked quite well -- I have experienced no dropped frames or sound. The mysterious ""copyright error"" others have mentioned has popped up but it has not caused problems (I notice it when I use the time limit function when capturing). I did have to buy an RCA adaptor ($2 to $3) as my VCR has only one audio output and the Video Advantage USB has two audio cables (they neglect to tell you this in the set-up instructions although it is on the Web site).You also need to consider whether the provided editing software is adequate. AD Full Cap is not what I needed and doubt I will ever use -- it is more for professional grade movies as the files it creates are huge (64 GB for 1 hour). Of course I did not learn this until after I started my first movie. If you are transferring movies like I am then you will use Power Producer and Power Producer Express (both by Cyberlink). Let's just say I have had my share of headaches with them. One of my movies had sound almost inaudible after I burned it to DVD -- little did I know that the input for the sound was too low and was adjustable in the process of creating an MPEG file. Also I found cutting out commercials to be less than intuitive although I finally was able to do so with much effort.Also this process can be quite time consuming (which is why I am glad I have the laptop to do it and can use my Dell for other things). The total time to transfer a two hour movie to standard quality file (MPEG) and burn to DVD is about 3.5 to 4 hours. Not that you need to be at your computer the entire time but your machine will be seriously tied up. Fortunately most of what I want to transfer is commercial free otherwise it would be even longer.Overall I give the Video Advantage USB good marks but the software provided lower grades. I figure once I am further along the process of transferring from VHS to DVD everything should be smoother. You may want to consider simply purchasing a video capture device and editing software separately -- software that one person loves is another person's nightmare so you can see what you like before you buy. Most importantly make sure you have a computer with not only enough processing speed, power, and hard drive capacity/speed but also the ability to dedicate almost completely to this process."
85123,0,"As a big petz fan, I feel I can give a well-informed review of the game based on my years of playing with them, breeding, owning sites, hexing etc. Here's my down-low on the game:The first thing I noticed about it was that in the manual it says ""when you cheat with your computer's calendar to speed up the birth of your Puppyz, the mother will become stuck in her pregnancy status. If this happens, there is no way to fix it! Be patient, don't do it!"" This seems pretty threatening, but I still have been able to time-forward without having to deal with stuck pregnancies.There is no longer the Playpen, the Clothes or Toy Closet. The Salon had basically taken over the Clothes Closet. The supply shelf now acts like the Toy Closet, but you will have to do a lot of hunting around in the game to get all the toys. When you win the mini games, you are rewarded with a new toy. I think thats both a positive and a negative. Its positive because you want to spend more time in the game playing to win toys, but negative because when you want a certain toy, it may not be available. As for the Playpen, I wish they wouldn't have taken it out. I don't know about anyone else, but I used it basically as my breeding room because they were no distractions.The new breeds are cool, but I found that the Golden Retriever has a major problem with the sleepy syndrome. When I was in the adoption center, almost every one of them that I took out had the syndrome. I guess they chose not to fix that bug from the last versions.The mini games are fun, but there are some problems with them too. In the agility game, I could not get my dogz to walk full length of the catwalk, all they did was sit there. Also, in the gopher tic-tac-toe, its hard to get your pet to fall on the right spot...it will often drop them on a different square than you wanted it to. I think the easiest game is in Arabia, so if you want to win some toys quickly, I suggest going there first.I guess I've been spending time talking about the negatives, but the game is good overall. The best feature is definitely the litters. It makes a breeders work so much easier :)Thats my review...I give it three and a half stars out of five overall. Hopefully Ubisoft will get some of our improvement suggestions and add a patch so that it will become a five star game."
23978,0,"Contains Two CDs. I really liked the first one. The Talk Now! CD is good for learning vocabulary. The double pronounciation between a male and female speaker was a good touch. I learned a lot of new vocabulary from this CD.But in the second CD (World Talk), there was a big jump in level. They start giving directions in Hebrew and using words that you would need to learn elsewhere. Verbs are used and conjugated without defining them or explanation. Useless for a true beginner. If I had just used the first CD-ROM and then started the second disc, I would have been totally clueless as to what was going on.Series doesn't deal with the Hebrew Alphabet or Grammer."

56806,1,I had to start version 9 without the user files from version 7. Even without the user files version 9 more quickly adapts to my needs. I can dictate faster and there are fewer mistakes. This reduces the time it requires for me to write a letter or produce a document. For these reasons I'm quite satisfied with the purchase.
17536,0,"this item is very good but I can not adjest the alpha in it, other wais is nice"
52367,1,"Caveat: I am comparing this to systemworks standard, 2005.Although I've been a user of symantec/norton products for about 10 years now, there has always been some bugginess about them. This is the smoothest release I've ever seen. This is also based on a 3 day review, so it's not really thorough. This also refers to the download version, which is a bit more difficult because I had to burn my own ISO boot/backup/restore disk.That aside, the reason for the 4 stars is the redundancy in ways to do the same (or very similar) thing twice, and for the minimal (if any) changes to Norton Utilities. Norton Ghost 10, for example, does automatic and manual restore checkpoints on backups. GoBack does the same thing, but it's not meant for ISO, obviously. GoBack hasn't changed much, if at all, since 2005. However, the two togther are somewhat redundant, and could be possibly merged. Safe install in Goback is now automatic, tho (i.e., ""it appears you are installing a new program, you'll have the option to restore to pre-install conditions"" or some such verbage).Norton Utilities is about the same, straight up. Wipe slack space, for example, is still a drop down selection, rather than a button option. In fact, everything in Norton Utilities seems the same in the control panel from 2005. No memory defrag. No internet tweaking tools. Just as an idea, symantec, if you're listening, and have no plans to improve Norton Utilities, you could set up a way to allow plug ins like Nvidias N-Tune app...What's new to me (and possibly other upgraders) is Checkit, which has been updated (but still covers mostly the same content), and Benchmark test, which compares my system against others, and itself, during tweaking, overclocking, or upgrades. However, the list of comparable systems is painfully short. I lucked up and had the exact same setup as one indicated, except for the drives. Process viewer, which is new, gives a greater deal of control and understanding to operating processes (same as the Windows process viewer, just with more options, such as Google this - useful for ID'ing what's running).Ghost has some redundancy in view progress and performance. Progress is shown during backups anyhow, performance is a useful tool though, to give a sliding scale priority to backups while using other programs, from low (very slow backup) to high (in-use desktop programs take forever, but ghost flies). My 15 gig test setup compressed to 3 gigs on my backup drive, and the incrementals have been reliably popping up to say they're doing so.What's different? System Optimizer includes user level controls (meaning you can, for example, restrict individual accounts or tweak individual accounts - there are also many more options in there now for tweaking and information. The downside is that settings are still locked to admin level accounts, except for basic things like virus scan.The main proggy startup has a changed ""Norton Status Screen"" which has been basically rearranged, but offers more immediate acccess to tools freqently used, rather than clicking ""change settings"" or ""more info"". Some have been renamed/regrouped, such as ""Performance"", which covers auto-protect, spyware, Improve Performance (accesses defrag), clean clutter, fix windows problems (windoctor). Also new is a Norton Status bar that attaches to the lower right taskbar (the regular task icons still install). But the Norton Status bar will pop up on startup giving a snapshot of system health, it seems to me a shortcut to the entire program, should things go wrong anywhere. The status bar is NOT system doctor, which is still available via Utilities.Everything boots smoother and faster, much faster. Of course, I haven't loaded the system down. I had tried Iolo's v6, and while I liked it's myriad of utilities (memory defrag and recover, for example, and a slew of others that Norton lacks) it was buggy beyond belief on almost everything else). I suppose, in all fairness, I should have tried a clean boot install of Iolo v6, but even so, its lack of information (just stuff like ""3 spyware programs detected"" without giving info was useless).Norton's antivirus scans are faster, and sport a new interface. Registry optimizer is about the same as before, and one button checkup hasn't changed.With the exception of Norton Ghost (which I love), I would have been disappointed in the upgrade had I purchased regular systemworks... the changes are incremental, rather than monumental. However, they make sense and improve the program, well, incrementally.One thing I still haven't isolated is use with Windows firewall... I was able to use Norton's worm detection and Windows firewall simultaneously without flaw in Systemworks 2005. Now when I try to do the same, downloads slow, then stop completely. It's one or the other, it seems (or install Norton Firewall, which the protection center will suggest (albeit unobtrusively, thank God.The whole core Norton system, including goback and all is now a 1 button install. Performance test is separate, and strikingly similar to checkit. There is also a new registration/validation procedure which claims to be designed to resolve the repeat installation errors that plagued 2005 (regular systemworks, anyhow).Also, during online purchase, I tried to delete the extended backup service, but it would delete the whole order. This only happened with Premiere, I tried it with other products, and it would not occur. CD Buyers will not have this issue, of course.Overall, I am happy with the purchase. Overclockers beware that a cmos reset, and even some overclockings, will screw the pooch on Systemworks, and require going thru all reinitilizations again (goback, full virus scan, etc.) - At least on my system. Your mileage may vary. I've probably missed a few dozen improvements which the Norton folks will protest, and the Iolo folks, well, they will learn from their customers .. but this is where things stand now.Norton is the 800 lb gorilla because it is the best, in my opinion, even with a few bugs, lack of Norton Utilities update, and some redundancy in functionality. If I had to summarize it another way, it is the best antivirus application around, period, with the best of the available utilities, even if they are significantly limited compared to other upstarts."
17879,0,"From the persective of someone who does not own this videogame but read all the reviews, I must say that the game looks unfavorable, despite the promise of the first three Harry Potter games. However, I have observed that most of the reviewers are disappointed about not being able to enjoy the ""classic, beautiful, enjoyable, sweet, puzzle-style games"" and complain about not exploring the castle. Well, this makes me want to ask these people if they have read this book!Harry has now been at Hogwarts four years and since he knows every secret passageway in the castle, he's bored with exploring because he has a map which tells him where everyone is and where all the secrets are. This means that if the producers were looking to mimic the actual life of Harry Potter in this book he would not be doing a lot of exploring, especially since he has quite enough on his plate when preparing for the Tri-Wizard Tournament.These reviewers complain about Mad-Eye Moody's Challenges which requires the players to jinx everything in sight. Well, again, if the producers were trying to mimic Moody's character, he is described as capable of jumping out of bed and jinxing everything he could reach out of his window, therefore, he would be teaching his students the one technique he still felt was effective.As to the controls, I agree that they are probably not what we have become used to in the previous Harry Potter games. Maybe the producers were trying to keep the challenge level up so that players would feel as though they are working as hard as Harry is. I do agree that there should be control configuration to allow every player his/her preference and am disappointed to hear that there is no such option.Finally, the reviewers complain about the game being less fun than the previous ones. Again, Harry does not have much time for fun this year! He's feeling pains in his scar, people think he's a freak and showoff (which in school, a showoff is worse than a freak), he watches a fellow student die, was entered into a competition against his permission, must deal with countless challenges on all playing fields, and he and his best friend are fighting (which makes him feel abandoned)! This is not a fun year! Harry does not have time for fun!If the producers were attempting to recreate this book for video game players, and they had this in mind when they made this game, then I would say they accomplished their goal. Therefore, it is entirely up to you whether you want to buy this game and deal with the challenges."

13549,1,"This game is very fun. I purchased this game a few years ago. You can have SpongeBob wake up on the right side of the bed or on the wrong side. There are 5 mini-games, but they are the same on either side of the bed. The cut scenes are funny even if the characters look a little different, and even though Mr.Krabs sounds a little different. After I play this game for a while, it gets boring. I set it aside for a while and when I come across it again, it is fun again."

45027,0,"I bought this for my daughter's 4th birthday, since she wanted a game of her own (her brother is 8 and loves computer games). She is also a big Curious George fan.The adventures consist of five short phonics games punctuated by a little arcade-style game in which George must 'leap' (using the arrow keys) to capture bananas as he moves to the next location. My daughter had only the slightest difficulty learning to use the arrow keys and the space bar, and now she's got it conquered. I did not have any problems installing or operating the game (on our XP machine).My problem lies in the widely varying difficulty of the games. The first one involves letter recognition; the second involves picking out the sounds of letters that START words; the third involves sorting 'packages' into those labeled with word that rhyme and words that do not; the fourth involves picking out the sounds of letters that END words; the fifth involves spelling actual words.Even when set at the easiest level, the rhyming game (#3) and the spelling game (#5) were way over her head. The rhyming game is very speedy; the packages will fall off a conveyer belt if you do not pick them up fast enough, and manipulating the arrow keys in this case was way too complicated. The spelling game, even at the low level, involved silent letters in dipthongs like 'leaf.' She could sound out words like 'dog' just fine but the silent letters left her frustrated.The game is progressive - you don't move onto the next one until you've finished with the one you're currently on, so getting stuck on #3 led to whimpering and sadness.Nevertheless, she is constantly asking to play. It's a fine game but you'll have to plan on playing with your kid until he/she can manage the rhyming and spelling alone."

40865,0,"Overall, an okay product. Many people complain their street isn't shown or recent construction isn't shown, but it takes about 3 years for new mapping data to make it all the way from satellite imagery, to purchasable data for companies like Microsoft to obtain, and then into their finalized product. So, if that new road, neighborhood, etc. has been there less than 3 years, then you really cannot expect it to be in Pocket Streets.If you purchase the full desktop version of Microsoft Streets and Trips then you're given the option to install the Microsoft Pocket Streets 2005 during installation of the full version. So, unless you ONLY want Pocket Streets, you're better off buying the full desktop version and installing it on your Pocket PC that way. Then you'll have a PC and a Pocket PC version of it and also have the ability to export maps from the full version to your Pocket version.If you don't live in a major metropolitan area then the map of where you live will not be on the CD-ROM. You'll have to use the full desktop version of Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005 and export the map(s) you need.The only change I would make to how the software works (other than the adding additional maps for those of us who don't live in major cities) is voice prompts. What's the point of having a PDA with GPS and Pocket Streets if I can't have it prompt me when to make a turn."

I love the Total training BRAND the name of the game for them is quality.If you watch the Training twice you will get so much more out of it. Since the first time around the information is just sinking in, after the second time, you will have a real good understanding. Then on to the Books and Advanced TOTAL training for Photoshop CS2. You will get so much out of this. I loved it so much I went out and GOT ALL THE TOTAL TRAING VIDEOS!! One by one. You will notice Deke uses his kids allot in the Video training, ask your why? He wants you to get to know him more, then you get to love him since he let you in so much of his life. He is personalizing him self so that he's not just another ROBOT.

The Digital Classroom series (even though not through Adobe) is just a redo of the CIB series with fewer editing errors and better pedagogy. The audience for the CIB series is questionable. An absolute beginner has no business with this series, and a low-intermediate will get something out of it, but with a price of unnecessary frustration. It reminds me of most technology and engineering. Most products are decent, but the tutorials/documentations is usually quite sub-par."

73851,1,My 7 year old loves this game - all 3 cds are great. He especially loves the mystery aspect of the game - it reminds me of the Carmen Sandiego mysteries I played as a kid. It also is a bit challenging - it includes the stuff that will be in his 2nd grade class.
49242,0,"This was an upgrade to my computer. I love the new features of this operating system, however it does not like my older devices. I could no longer use my scanner or printer. They are great old friends and HP is not going to support Vista for them because they are over 7 years old.After finding this out I wanted to find the button to revert to my old operating system so I could continue scanning the family photos of my recently deceased parents. Unlike my upgrade from Win98 to WinXP there was no easy button. I would have to reinstall Windows XP and all my hardware's original drivers. My software was bundled on the computer so I had no disks. Too much trouble for me, so I had to buy a new printer and most of them are not ready for Windows Vista so you are getting only the bare min. functions. I've been waiting several months now and still no scanner at an affordable price that has all the features of my Dinosaur.So my suggestion would be to make sure your hardware is compatable before you purchase because chance are the manufacturer will not provide upgraded software and although they might be there for a price most of what I just looked at the discount stores do not support Windows Vista."

I recently switched to a Powermac G-4, and am glad I did, but the one thing I miss the most in the PC world is MS Money: it is just a better, more intuitive product. Unfortunately, Quicken is the only game in town for Mac users. It's okay, but Money is better."
78319,1,"My 4 & 5 year old daughters have been playing this one for a year now. It has never hit the bottom of the CD game pile! It is fun, while it teaches - which is the best part! You search for 4 jewels while you try to get things done for Clifford's party. There are games along the way as well as thinking adventures. One game involves sorting grocery items into their correct places on the shelves - which helps teach counting and spatial skills. There are plenty of activities to keep your child busy, and teach them something too! I highly recommend this one! Who doesn't love Clifford! ""Woof!"""
47272,1,This product is a pretty good buy. It's definitely worth the 30 bucks and it's very user friendly. The only small problem with it is some of the minor things like playlist and things aren't as user friendly but aside from that it's been doing a great job and I'm definitely enjoying it!
2740,1,"I received Quicken 2007 Deluxe one week ago, and I am amazed at how muchbetter it is than Microsoft Money 2005. I checked on line as to which was the top rated personal finance software and Quicken came out on top. I decided to try it even though I had seen a lot of negative reviews here.After the updates it worked great. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get a handle on their finances."
69750,1,"Ghost Dogs is my second Nancy Drew adventure, and it lives up to the praise. However, there are two major flaws that kept me from giving it a perfect 5.1.) The puzzles! I read in one person's review, and agree wholeheartedly, that some puzzles were...um...useless. Sadly I had to resort to cheating because it didn't occur to me how OFTEN Roman Numerals would be used. Right now I am playing through Old Clock, and that game seems to make more use of connecting puzzles to the storyline. See I, too, like coming to a puzzle armed with information and it seemed all that history digging did me no good.2.) The ending! I don't know, the ending didn't really EXPLAIN how the culprit pulled off the dog attacks...or how their eyes turned YELLOW. Also, there was no ""aha!"" factor when I saw who was behind it all. Really, I had the criminal pegged halfway through the game. It wasn't too hard (as there were only THREE people/suspects). But it was still a satisfying conclusion...just not the best.Aside from that, a really enjoyable adventure. Great characters, story, visuals, etc. I look forward to finishing Old Clock and writing a review for it."
76711,1,"The first reviewered probably missed some of the features and thought them removed because they have moved. But the interface is better than before, and if you are new to this program you'll like how easy it is. It has both basic and more advanced editing tools. If you want simple photo editing, get Picture It Photo Premium 9, but this program gives you more control over how you edit."
33754,2,"The first think I noticed about this program is that it's SLOW--it takes forever to load, and you can actually see the screen redraw. The user interface skinning is not particularly attractive, and it's obviously very inefficient--you can see it draw the background and then draw the user interface elements on top of it. And I don't have a slow computer--it's an Athlon 64 3000+ with 1GB DDR400 RAM. I shudder to think how sluggish and unresponsive it would be on a Celeron system.My other complaint is that all of the useful options have been removed. In particular, the bootable CD functionality has been gutted--it's no longer possible to slipstream a Windows install CD, which was a very useful feature for sysadmins.All I want is a fast, useful, and unobtrusive CD/DVD mastering utility, and Roxio 7 fails on all three counts."
8489,0,"Version 7.0 preferred has excellent voice-recognition. However there are some glaring incompatibilities that make the product almost unusable. For example; I have XP Pro service pack two and the latest upgrades to Internet Explorer 6.0. With NaturallySpeaking running, whether I use voice or mouse to click on favorites and select a link, IE completely locks up. Therefore I have to shut down NaturallySpeaking before I can use Internet Explorer, and then restart it when I'm finished browsing. As mentioned by other reviewers ScanSoft charges USD19.95 for each support call after the first -- even to report a glaring bug such as the one mentioned above. This is unconscionable. Based on their support policies alone I would have to say stay away from their products."

32873,1,"This is an excellent way to learn astronomy and stargzing. I purchased the ""Starter"" edition then upgraded to ""Backyard"" though this is not really necessary to get value out of the purchase. Both editions come with a book that is so similar it is redundant, but there was no choice when upgrading online at the manufacturer's site.Starry Night has many features that will help any level of astronomy student. Backyard allows one to travel further back and forward in time to understand the motion of the Universe. It also has more stars (supposedly one million, but who's counting).The book(s) is(are) well written and reference the software so one can actually see what is being described. I hope other scientific books follow a similar path. The software is easy to use and lots of fun. My kids and I have spent much time looking at the features and will likely do so for years to come."

24154,1,"Zoombini's Logical Journey* Grades 3-7* MathematicsCOMMENTS:There is no time pressure as in many games, player must think mathematically and use logic skills to problem-solve, arcade type game that teaches classification skills, problem solving skills used as obstacles are encountered, not a typical math program with numbers and arithmetic operations. Instead, the player develops skills working with attributes, patterns, groupings, sorting, comparisons, and problem solving while helping these unusual characters succeed in life.CLASSROOM CONNECTION:Logical Journey is an exceptionally well-designed program that will clearly develop math thinking skills. It is challenging, visually captivating, and should hold a student's attention and interest. It is beneficial if someone is available to explain how each obstacle can be overcome as students/children use the program. Logical Journey is also a good program for small groups and independent use in a classroom setting. It should be used to introduce and practice critical thinking and logical reasoning skills."

60164,1,"I received this gift for Christmas - the Pinnacle Studio AV/DV version 9.1 with the PCI video card. I was all excited about this gift, because we have a bunch of 8mm video of our little Hannah, then I went on amazon.com and a bunch of other places and saw the reviews on this... then wasn't as excited. But I thought - what the heck, it's a gift, and looking on the other options (i.e. Ulead, Sony Vegas), they seemed way too expensive when this package had the PCI card and software all in one - so I decided to try it out anyways.First, a little more background: I have no other video editing experience, so this is new to me. Also, computer specs: I am running a computer with 2GB RAM, 80GB hd, Intel Pentium 4 3GHz processor. Running Windows XP Professional with SP2 installed, as well as other software (i.e. virus, firewall, backup, etc.)Thus far, here are my summary thoughts (1/8/05): This hardware/software package worked as well as I would have expected - very satisfied. No complaints thus far, though I have not yet burned a DVD - will post once I do that. 2/13/05: I have just burned my first DVD (it took awhile for other reasons), and everything went well. There were a few quirks (see below), but nothing that would change me from enthusiastically recommending this!Detailed thoughts:First, I installed the software per the instructions. The install worked very cleanly - I had no problems with installing, though installing took a bit of a long time (especially the DVD bonus effects that come with the set). Previous reviews had mentioned that there were some errors with XP and SP2 - I had none (I even checked that yes, I am still running *!?$* SP2). Install never crashed or stalled or anything. The install also updated the software automatically (even when I ran the software and checked for updates, there were none).Next was installing the hardware (PCI card). Piece of cake, no problems. Rebooted machine, placed CD into machine for device drivers, no problems. (note that the install here adds about twenty-seven new registry items by my count.)This morning I ran the software and captured from an analog RCA input. I made sure to hook up the RCA video to the video in and the RCA audio to my PC's audio in with the adapter included with this package (note that you will still need your own RCA male-male cables). Captured a 20 second video with audio, and it captured very cleanly. Added some transitions and background music to some scenes, and published to MPEG - no problems, everything worked as it should. The only complaint I would have is that the output was a little fuzzy, but I think that had more to do with my settings - will post more once I get time to play with the software more.Now that I have burned my DVD, here are my thoughts from that: It was very easy to burn the DVD, although the ""burn directly"" function didn't seem to work. I had to compile the DVD and the burn it to DVD through separate functions - still easy, but one more intermediate step. Either way, it should be noted that compiling the DVD takes some time - on my machine, 1.5 hours of DVD material took about 1.3 hours to compile (so set it to go and go do something else for awhile). But I think that's to be expected given the compression methods. The other quirk is that my DVD writer is a DVD+RW, but my own DVD player doesn't read +RW, only -RW, so I would suggest checking to make sure your DVD player can read your DVD type (www.videohelp.com is a great help in this)."

60805,1,"I started with Turbo/Borland Pascal. As soon as Borland released Delphi 1, I purchased it. I have used every version of Delphi: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and now Delphi 8. Delphi 8 is a huge change from Delphi 7. The IDE is very different. The help system appears to be relatively complete, but works differently than Delphi 5, 6, or 7.As a long time Delphi uses, I was dismayed at some of the changes in Delphi 8. You now have the option of creating Windows Forms applications. For me, the biggest downside of this is the loss of frames. Frames are part of the VCL, not part of the Windows Forms. There does not appear to be anything equivalent. This is a shame. I used frames and frame inheritance a lot.If you plan on just moving your code from Delphi 5, 6, or 7 to Delphi 8 you will be disappointed. There are many changes in the language. Developers should avoid appending to strings because that process is now slow. In my opinion, this broke one of the most powerful advantages Delphi had. Delphi used to be able to perform string operations quickly. That feature was lost in Delphi 8. There are new tools to help, like the string builder class, but they are cumbersome to use.Delphi now integrates with other .Net languages; but there are some costs with that capability. This is not a small, incremental upgrade to the language."

My roomate used it to design a bar for a school project and the teacher loved it. We both thought it was pretty easy to use and could do exactly what we wanted to do with it."

I'm able to quickly convert my digital camera photos and digital video into slide shows and edited videos complete with fun transitions. Then create CDs and DVDs.

It's been a long, drawn-out bait and switch. Intuit's loyal TurboTax customers are likely going to remain locked in to using TurboTax since the time, labor, cost and frustration of switching products will be higher than the increased price of TurboTax and online return submittals. It is galling, and many (including me) will continue to pony up the fees, but it doesn't make me happy that my brand loyalty has been turned into servitude."

The StreetFinder Software is also very good, and has a high quality Rand McNally maps.

Suse is nice up to date and easy to upgrade *due to YAST* (YOU) an installer. However, This is easy to use with noobies (new users) but your linux knowlage won't expand much with all rpms. (installer like things that need no compiling). The price is high to me compared to Mandrakes 39.99. Linux is free online, but for users like me on dialup I musy buy/contribute to the distro. Usually they are not to expensive. This one seemed too high 2 me, but I gave ita whirl. All installed fine. easy as pie.

Gfx are good, sound is good. Lots of compatability. Even has firefox on it. woohoo! a nice release. a little steep in price but doable. i see enterprise editions and a future becoming as redhats.

It is so much more intuitive than MS Office. I have the Office for Mac and I have been using Office in Windows for the past 10 years. But ever since I started using Pages and Keynote, and now Numbers, I have to say hands down, iWork 08 is near perfection for 99.9% of all office needs.I wish there were even more templates for all three apps. But with the included templates, one could modify them to create new templates fairly easy and quick.My trial period is coming to an end in a couple of weeks. I will buy the iWork 08 for sure."
75946,1,"At the risk of being labeled a McAfee stooge, I wanted to provide a positive review for McAfee Internet Security Suite 2004. I installed all of the applications of the suite with no problems. I have a year old Dell 4550 with XP Professional. I had let my Microsoft Updates slide a bit, forgot about them, and the machine got infected with Sasser. After battling Sasser for a day (on two different machines) and with my Norton Antivirus subscription running out at the end of May, I decided to get serious about Internet security. I have never had anything but Norton Anti-virus, no firewalls, not anti-spy, no privacy service. So I read about Norton Internet Security at the Norton site. It sounded great and it had favorable reviews with the publications. So I checked Amazon for prices. Much to my surprise there was major weeping and gnashing of teeth in the user reviews, 171 reviews and most of them terribly negative. Ok, so I checked out McAfee Internet Security. It appeared to be principally the same product, with similar features. It as well had reviewed positively in magazines, but McAfee's user reviews were not better than Norton's. There were far less of them, only 52, but again most were negative.Not wanting blue screens of death, wiped out registries, or a computer that ran slow as sludge. I decided to look around. I found basically the same thing, positive reviews in the magazines and negative user reviews, only far less reviews altogether. So I went back to Norton and McAfee. Using a vague notion that happy users do not write as many reviews as angry users, coupled with the fact that Amazon's price on McAfee was significantly lower than Norton (I did not qualify for either company's rebate) I decided to go with McAfee.I installed the entire suite without a hitch. I was impressed with the relative simplicity of the configuration process. The program asked questions which for the most part I understood, rather than the typical provide the ""GNP of the TCI/IP of the IPS of DNS of the port number 3213 at which baud rate"" etc etc. In fact I did not have to refer to any of the address, IPS, gobblygook. The upgrade process seemed a bit clunky at first but worked well. Within several hours I had the suite completely installed, upgraded, registered, and configured. The computer has behaved normally and I believe runs at the normal speed. The applications all seem to work well, and they upgrade automatically while logged on to the Internet.Am I putting in a plug for McAfee? Not really, I have no axes to grind or laurels to lay. I do feel that with the overwhelming number of bad reviews that it might be helpful for a potential buyer to realize that there are some people who had good luck with the installation. I certainly am no computer whiz. All I can say is that I had no problems, the applications are working well, and it is a nice piece of software for Amazon's $40 price tag. Good luck!"
90959,1,"Don't be fooled by the graphics, this game rocks! Personally I found the graphics rather cute myself though! You start out with $4000 and a horse. Usally I sell the horse (after it is acually worth some money) and get another one. You have to take your horse to the vet to get it's shots and/or neuter your male or see if your female is going to have a foal. There are two ways to make your horse have a foal: Bying a male horse to breed with your female one (or the other way around) or going to the breeders with a female horse and paying the stud fee to breed your mare with any of the stallions. You can enter compations or just ride your horse around.Now here are the only bad things:The Compations are very hardIt is excpensive to upgrade your stable (though it is a must do thing)Also, you can't see the horses you are boardingNow back to the numarious good things! Another good thing about the game is that the begining may be hard, once you get the hang of it, you really earn a lot of money! You can still earn a lot of money without racing, I make a lot of money without racing at least. This is a must buy game that never gets old! No matter how many times you play, no matter how much money you've earned, you can still keep trying to breed a champion!"

You'll want to try everything! Play around with the artistic filters and amaze yourself. You can always undo any changes you make.This is a professional grade photo editing suite.

44123,0,"Quite possibly the best price you will pay for this, and for home use, it's really the best office package. If you're used to earlier versions of the office suite, this one takes quite a learning curve to operate, and the menu bar has drastically changed. Microsoft in their infinite wisdom (or lack there of) keeps making each version easier for those who have never seen it, and makes those seasoned users curse like a sailor for a few months until we figure out where everything has been moved to. Not to mention the fact that ""Why doesn't office come bundled into the operating system anyway?"". It's because the only true way to spell Microsoft is ""Micro$oft"". They know that Works is a piece if crap, nobody will use it, and then they can sell an overpriced copy of Office. Well the price here will make this bittersweet reality a little more easy to swallow.

Its easy to navigate, you can print out the books or read them on the screen, the text to speech is cool, but not perfect. I hope they release more CDs like these, not that I'd have time to get to them if I read all 10,000+ books!"
27300,1,"I bought this product a few years ago, and unlike the ""cheesy"" green screen techniques that some video programs have added as an afterthought, ULTRA 2 has professional standards and tweaks that make for excellent green screen productions (provided your equipment and skills are up to par).Without going into paragraphs of extended details; the difference between ULTRA 2 and typical green screen applications is like a 1st-generation, 900kb Digital Camera Picture compared to a modern 12 Megapixel image of today.The biggest problem right now, is that Apple bought out Serious Magic, and customer support seems to be lacking a bit. I am hopeful that we can work-out the minor problems and I can return to some creative work.If you love playing with green screen and doing professional-level stuff, get this program!"
71057,1,"Both my 5 year old granddaughter, Hannah and 3 year old granddaughter, Hallie enjoyed the bundle. There are several levels, so it was challenging and enjoyable for both. It was very helpful with the subjects that were being introduced in Hannah's kindergarten class, such as the geometry."

69593,1,"What a deal. I've been looking for something simple, to help me create a decent, usable website. This is it. Simple to learn, less costly than Dreamweaver, and it has a number of good templates to help you get up and running quickly. I had my site up and loaded onto my server in about 5 hours. Very functional, very user friendly, very good looking designs. You can download trial version from the Virtual Mechanic website and try it 15 days for free. It's even cheaper there than the Amazon price. DO IT!"
35656,1,"This thing RULES ALL! It's extremely simple to use. Start it up when you computer acts sticky or schedule it to keep your PC running in top shape. Norton AntiVirus, which is included, found one virus on my system which my updated McAfee Virus Scan did not. Norton AntiVirus auto protect scans incoming and outgoing email for viruses so it's next to impossible to contract or spread anything. Combine that with Norton's easy to configure Firewall and Live update and you've got a safe, optimized system."
73344,0,"This program attemps to have the user simply absorb the language, imitating the way a native speaker learns. However, a native speaker uses the language constantly for years, which a program cannot duplicate. In the absence of that, it seems to me unreasonable to learn a new language with ZERO explanations of grammatical structures, basic words, and word-formation. More of a balance would be in order.Similarly, the fact that the program does not teach Arabic script is a serious drawback. No one can be expected to deciper the complex orthography of Arabic just by hearing the words and memorizing how they look on the screen. Even native speakers are taught the alphabet systematically!Thirdly, the learning seems too passive. The user never needs to generate his or her own Arabic--only to choose between the pictures or sentences provided. Even in the ""speaking"" sections one need only copy what the speaker has already said.The main positive thing about this program is the repetition. The user sees the new words many, many times and absorbs them easily.All things considered, for someone who knows the script and basic grammar this program can be a valuable tool for listening comprehension and vocabulary building."

26311,1,"After using Norton antivirus for several years on multiple computers with no problems and the 2006 version ever since it came out, also with no problems, I thought it would be interesting to see what the state of the art was in AV software so I did some research on the Internet. I think complaints about Norton slowing computers are exaggerated and I have never considered my computers slow, I just wanted to see what was out there. Generally, Norton gets decent reviews on most web sites but Kaspersky was often rated higher so I thought I would try it since my Norton subscription was expiring in a few days anyway. I ordered Kaspersky version 6.0 from Amazon for $50 with a $50 rebate and I thought it doesn't get any better than that. I uninstalled Norton and after installing Kaspersky, my computer continuously restarted. The manual tells what to do in such an event but their solution didn't work. I called their tech support and spent two hours on the phone trying to correct the problem. I downloaded and ran the Norton uninstaller, I downloaded and ran the Kaspersky uninstaller, I downloaded and installed Kaspersky version 7.0. We tried everything that the tech could think of, same problem. I asked him if this was a common problem and he said yes even though the manual says it is rare. It was late in the day and I was tired from the effort so I asked the tech if we could continue the next day and he said he would call me at 8 a.m. the next morning. Well, I've been around awhile and I doubted that he would call, and he didn't. After reviewing everything I had read about antivirus software and considering my experience with Norton, I downloaded and installed Norton antivirus 2008. It was easy and it's working perfectly. I'm sure that Kaspersky is excellent software if it works for you, but it didn't work for me and I'm not interested in going to all the effort it would require to try to make it work. I can count on one hand the number of times I have needed tech support for hardware or software so the fact that Norton charges for tech support is not important to me since I've never needed it anyway. I may try a different program someday, something like Nod 32 if they fix their interface, but for now I'm going to go by the old adage ""if it ain't broke don't fix it""."

21044,0,"This product has one of the most comprehensive spyware scanning systems of any other Spyware removal product. Norton and Mcaffee are of course beat hands down, since they are virus programs, that act more as firewalls and anti Virus programs than spyware removers. Even specialized programs like Spyware Doctor and Trend Micro cannot compete, as the definitions of this product include some of the most obscure malware. The reason behind the succes of this product, is it's ability to remove Root kits (files encoded to hide from windows). No other program on themarket can do this at this time.That said, the removal power of this product comes at the cost of almost everything else. Interface is annoying clunky and slow. Browser guards, are comprehensive, but ONLY support inernet explorer. The realt time protection offered is decent, but is insatiably RAM hungry, and will slow down your computer so much that you're better off disabling them. Even if you decide to bite the bullet and have a slow PC, this program is incredibly unstable, often will not respond, and will from time to time prevent windows from shutting down. Even the scanning engine is terrible, even if it's deffinitions are comprehensive. It took my 3.4ghz with 512mb RAM 45min to do a spyware scan with Rootkit checking enabled. After findiding an Apropos media infection it took nearly 2hrs to remove it. At the end of the day, unless you have a terrible infection, you;'re better off with quicker more basic programs like Spyware Doctor, or Trend micro.Pros-Comprehensive deffinition file-Rootkit detection-And ""end of the road"" option for serrious infectionsCons-Slow scaning speed-Unstable-Only supports Real Time protection for Internet Explorer-Clunky interface-Large File size"

49741,1,"Power Tab software is pretty much the same thing and if you're looking for something better than Power Tab, then this isn't it either.

45705,1,"They really did a great job on SuSE Linux 9.0. The hardware compatiblity is tremendous, along with the hardware it auto detects. Has support for winmodems which is no lie, it picked up the one on my laptop(previous versions did not)and even recognized properly my display adapter(Radeon Mobility 345IGP)and even caught my printer correctly(HP PSC 1210v). I am amazed this time and definately considering switching! It is more secure, stable, and more configurable than Windows possibly ever will be depending on if longhorn really does fix all or most of those previous problems. It has better networking capabilities this time around too. GUI seems to look &quot;cleaner&quot; than previous builds also. If you don't want to spend thousands on a mac(even though they are superior machines)but still want the in between that kind of takes the best of both worlds, then download or buy SuSE Linux 9.0, it's the best version ever!"
88297,1,"This is a great product - especially for the price. I purchased it to archive my husband's old high school basketball games and my old dance recitals - it worked really well. Set-up was quick and easy. Using it is also very easy (once you figure it out)- the instructions aren't super clear about the advanced mode, which is what you use the most. After some trial and error I figured things out and it works great.Some other reviews complained about the audio being off by a second - on mine, it's off when I am recording it on my computer but once I burn it and watch it from the disk it's perfect. I highly recommend this product to make sure your precious memories are safe :)"
12965,0,"I've used TT for the last 6 years without a problem, and didn't expect to have any when I sat down to install Fed & State and start our return this weekend.I did encounter the problem that other reviewers noted, regarding an error message when trying to obtain updates (something to the effect that there was an error due to a firewall preventing download), but was able to get it to work without too much trouble. WHY this worked I'm not sure, but after receiving the error message I closed/reopened both TT and my internet connection (AOL Security Edition). I then brought TT to the point where it was ready to start the return, then selected ""one click update"" from the toolbar at the top of the window. This successfully initiated, and eventually completed, the update. I also discovered that in looking for help to fill out a line their ""help"" menu referred me to an incorrect page in my State's tax book. Granted it was only off by two pages, but someone who is new to the whole tax thing maybe wouldn't have figured it out.I think that the program worked fine, but am not impressed with the seemingly constant barage of requests/suggestions to ""activate"" new programs for a ""small fee."" If I were interested in additional programs, I would have purchased them. Now, if they want to include advertising in the box that's fine with me. If they want to include a separate disc of ""trial versions"" of their other programs, then more power to them. I DO NOT need to see advertisements while processing my tax return - whoever it was in Marketing that came up with that idea deserves a swift kick in the hiney!Anyway, the product did what I needed it to do. I just can't give TT a higher rating due to the force-fed marketing you have to endure while trying to complete your return."
82848,1,"I bought ClickArt 750,000 because it had more images for less money - only to find that there were fewer than 200,000 images in the box and I'd have to download the rest! Very aggravating. Art Explosion 600,000, in contrast, is an honest clip art product. All 600,000 images are in the box. It's a much better option. And the graphics are of very high quality."
13451,1,"I should say that I have not finished this yet.I am a novice at computer games.I enjoyed the graphics-they were very well done.I especially enjoyed Ireland. The scenery looked real. The rocks looked like you could touch them.However, the sheep need to be made more lifelike! There were some action scenes that were impressive, such as riding the horse through the water.I got stuck at one part, but my 12 year old nephew and his brother were able to play. However, we all needed walkthrough instructions. I would find it impossible to do without walkthroughs.This is definitely not for young children. The E rating should be changed to teenager or adult. I appreciated the fact that there was not much violence. A couple of monsters were killed but that was quite lowkey. There was one brief reference to rape,and the mention of human sacrifice could be frightening to young children. There was some blood shown in a couple of scenes but little actual violence shown. Also, no profanity was spoken.I was very frustrated at times but this certainly is a challenge. This is appropriate for kids over 12 and adults."
15544,1,"I've tried many applications, but frankly this new version 7 E-commerce contruction Kit from MacMillan publishing &amp; Boomerang Software is absolutely great.It was easy to isntall and use, the instructins were clear, it came with a printed user guide (which seems to be a luxury nowadays with software packs), and it did what it promised.I can make regular web sites, but my real interest was to make E-Commerce sites, with a database using Access. It did this flawlessly. I could have used its internal Database to add my products, but I chose to directly import my Microsoft Access database of products and prices, which worked great.Its Active Server Pages enable me to build and add more ASP code to create more dynamic and advanced features visually, which is very nice and powerful, I do not recall having seen such a thing anywhere else.All in all, I was quite pleased with it, and I reccommend it."

12903,1,"At first, I was hesitant to upgrade my computer to XP from Windows ME. But when I finally did, my computer started operating a lot better than before.A few points:1. My computer runs faster now. I hesitated to upgrade to XP because I feared it wouldn't run very well with my 128 MB RAM. Now, after the upgrade, it is running faster and smoother.2. With Windows ME, I had trouble shutting down my PC. It often refused to shut down, forcing me to shut off the power and then having trouble starting it up the next time I booted up the computer. This problem was completely eliminated with XP.3. With Millennium Edition I needed to install certain software to make my CD-RW work. Windows XP already takes care of that with no programs to install.4. The transition to XP was very smooth. It left all my files and programs intact. It even left my quick launch items just as they were in my old Windows ME. It also notified me during installation which programs will not work with the new XP (such as Norton Anti Virus and another program I had in Windows ME).I recommend anyone with 128 MB of RAM or more to go ahead with the upgrade, because it will spare you a lot of headaches."

16064,1,"We purchased Garmin City Navigator Europe (v. 2011.10, for our Nuvi 265wt) for a 2 week vacation covering Venice, Tuscany, Amalfi Coast and Rome. Overall, we're glad we did, and especially in the Cortona region of Tuscany where our rented villa was located, it was a godsend. But the whole experience was not without its frustrations.DVD vs MicroSDIf I had to do this over again, I would have gone for the MicroSD card. I initially found the multiple purchased options (download, SD, DVD) confusing, given that each offers different flexibilities in terms of mapping routes, loading to the device, upgrading maps, etc. I decided on DVD for the greatest flexibility (and concern about the SD card popping out accidentally and losing our maps).Well, I ordered it on July 3, 2010, and it did not arrive until August 15. That's 6 weeks, and Customer Service could only tell me ""it's back ordered"". Could be that I was waiting for the first 2011 version (a good thing I guess), but the Garmin website and tech support were both equally unhelpful in setting expectations or explaining delay.Then began the hellacious installation process. I am a computer professional and work on PCs and software every day. I could not get the software to install, and the error message was totally unhelpful. The FAQs were useless, so that triggered several emails over a couple of days that came back with unhelpful ""scripted answers"". Then finally, *on a weekday only*, came the 2 hours on the phone with tech support. The good news is that they did finally get the software and maps installed, but only after manually working around hidden requirements not found anywhere on the Garmin site. What Garmin doesn't tell you: the installer looks for 5GB free space on your C: drive (even though the maps, once installed, only take 2.3 GB); failing that it simply declares an error and exits. It took a savvy tech support person webexed into my computer to get around the inflexible and uninformative installer to install the maps on a disk partition that had the required space.One of the advantages of the DVD version is the ability to use the MapSource software to create routes and then download them to your device or an SD card, along with selected maps. Well be prepared to spend some time figuring out how to use this very unintuitive MapSource software. I did, finally, manage to create some routes just before departing for Italy - but in the hurry to download them and the maps to my device, they somehow never made it. Could very well have been pilot error - so, again, be prepared to spend time making friends with this puppy.MapsThe maps and detail overall were very good - with one major exception: Venice. Not surprising I guess, Venice being a walking city with no cars. But wait - our Nuvi265 has pedestrian mode, which I hoped to use to find recommended restaurants, or closest route back to our hotel over a limited number of canal bridges. Forget that and arm yourself with good paper maps of Venice.Then came out drive from Venice to Tuscany's Cortona area. Ultimately, it got us there, but......it was completely lost getting us from the Venice Marco Polo airport to the A4 (the main route south). As we followed the very clear street signs, Garmin claimed we were ""off the map"" for about 15 minutes, until we actually got onto the A4...going around cities (Padova, Firenze), the directions name way too many segments with names that do not correspond to signage, and key ramps/exits are not called out soon enough (we accidentally missed ramps/exits twice in our trip, costing frustration and lost time).As I said, it did get us to the remote village of Montanare, but our trust in ""Allie"" was diminished, and we felt we had to continually cross-check her against paper maps.It got us to the Amalfi Coast, but only after we programmed Salerno as a waypoint to avoid a shortcut on smaller roads that we felt would be hard to follow on the rainy day we drove south.It got us hopelessly lost trying to find Mt. Vesuvius Park as a POI. My bad for not spending time the day before we left Amalfi to cross-check its route against paper maps! My wife got sick of hearing ""...recalculating..."" as we tried to find our way out of the tiny, congested, one-way streets of Boscoreale where it took us to instead of to the Park. (We finally bailed on seeing Vesuvius from the volcano itself).It did get us to our hotel in Fiumicino and to the airport where we dropped off our car. (We did not use pedestrian mode in Rome and did fine with paper maps).In general, that ""last mile"" problem was continually the sticking point - ""Allie"" insists on giving you ""12 rights and bear lefts"" on unnamed roads when 3 with the ""common use"" road names would have reduced confusion and increased confidence.Lessons LearnedIf I had to do this over, I would either have purchased the SD version (reviews of that product are generally much better), or I would have planned much more time awaiting DVD, installing, learning MapSource, transferring routes, etc.I would also have purchased more paper maps with more detail of all the cities/areas we visited so as to be able to cross-check the Garmin more confidently.I also *definitely* would spend more time *the day before* a drive, programming and cross-checking Allie's routes.And one lesson for Garmin: Take the feedback I gave customer service and (a) puts more details about the software, map version, product availability and installation requirements on your website, and (b) improve the installer to let the user decide where to install the MapSource software and the disk-gobbling maps!"

It would be nice if the Word documents were saved with the old .doc extension and compatible with previous versions of MS Word. It is difficult for users with older versions of MS Word to read the .docx files. They can download a reader, put still a pain. One can force files to be saved in .doc format but the file looses the new features of Word 2007.I registered copies of this software on three different computers with no problem. Only knew this was allowed by reading someone else's review of this product on Amazon."

73563,0,"I do not know any Italian. I bought Level 1 of the Rosetta Stone about 7 weeks ago from off their radio adds. I have put in nearly one hour a day for approx four days a week. I am disappointed in this product. There is value, but you will need to purchase other software or books to supplement as other reviewers have stated.Here are some of my issues, though there are others: No explantory text. You see 4 pictures and the voice says it in Italian and you must choose 1 of the 4 pictures. While this has some value, the lack of explantory text would be extremely helpful. I have no idea if I said ""The Boy is jumping"" or ""A boy is leaping"". While I get the idea he is jumping/leaping, it would be helpful to know what I am saying so if I ask something in Italian, I start the sentence structure out correctly. The other negative is how they use the word Bambino vs. Ragazzo vs. figlio. All three mean boy or male child. Specifically, Bambino can and does mean ""baby"" while figlio means ""son"". Rosetta Stone does a poor job of distinguishing this ""at"" times in their pictures. Thirdly, there were many pictures where you really can't identify if it is boy or girl (those of you who have gone through this one know what I am talking about).So, while I think there is value, just know you need to have some supplements to your learning Italian. For the money, I would pass."
12646,1,"I thought Windows XP would be just another windows, but its not. Windows XP is amazing, it understands what you are doing and simplifies the process. For example I was installing something and immediatly it told me this software was out of date. Then it automatically gave me a website to go and upgrade. So many things like this makes it a very easy to use operating system. Not only does it work better but it is much, much, much faster than previous versions. Take all the benifits from windows nt such as reliability.. and add that to the compatability of windows 98 and u get Windows XP. This is quite possibaly the best operating system ever made! I would very highly recommend Windows XP to everyone. Microsoft has really outdone itself this time."

Clearly, you can highlight a track as many times as you want, either with the mouse, or with the F7 and F8 keys. I've never had a problem highlighting tracks or positioning the cursor. You could even type in the exact From/Thru times if you double-click on those fields on the toolbar. Editing, for me, has always been very easy with PowerTracks.Don't let the price fool you. This program is very powerful and is very easy to use."

12133,0,"This is a decent product with some useful features but it is not overly sophisticated. It is limited to 4 users and does not work among users in ""real time"" - it must be synced up to a central database before you can get an updated copy. That process can occasionally get messy. I am currently moving to a much more robust system as my company and needs have grown. Also this program requires double entry into quickbooks to create an invoice if you are tracking appointments and things like that."
36541,1,"I bought this game for some extra math practice in the summer. My six-year-old is a math whiz (she is already doing basic multiplication and division in her head), and enjoys playing the medium and hard levels of the game. My 4-year-old doesn't read yet, but can do most of the easy level problems. The game reads all of the instructions out loud, so he just has to listen carefully to the task.I like the fact that you can install the game on the hard drive and all your progress is saved, and it supports multiple players. Each completed task earns money for the players to use in the arcade, which only becomes available after the player has completed every task at least once. You can complete the tasks in any order, and revisit any task at any time. There is a map on the help screen to keep track of which tasks have been completed. The arcade games are also somewhat educational, testing memory (Monster Memory Match resembles the electronic Simon game), visual perception (Bug Bomber is a lot like Bejeweled), and eye-hand coordination(Big Top Bounce is like Break Away).The games include:1. Filling orders at a toy store, learning place value and borrowing2. Completing window patterns on the skyscraper, much like tangrams3. Sorting animals at a pet store based on number of legs, color, or pattern4. Selecting items at a bulk grocery store, testing greater or less than; small, medium, and large; and equivalent quantities5. Filling candy orders with the right number of each candy (and at the higher levels, choosing the right size box to fill)6. Sorting pies, which uses basic multiplication and division7. Making smoothies, correctly measuring ingredients8. Weighing fish, comparing different weight combinations9. Measuring fruits and vegetables, using a ruler and comparing lengths10. Riding the bus, counting out exact change11. Riding the subway, finding the correct stop number12. Riding the ferry, setting the clock to the correct timeThe game is full of animations to explain every task or thank you for helping out. Fortunately, you can skip over any animation by hitting the Escape key. There is a help icon in the corner if you need extra information for any task. All in all, my kids really like it, and it seems like a good way to reinforce some basic math skills. I like it enough that I am planning to purchase the version for grades 3-5, as well."
57089,1,"I recently bought Microsoft's Office 2007 suite for Power Point, and am very pleasantly surprised by 3 of the 4 programs, particularly, One Note. I had been looking for a personal and business organization program for several years, both for my own use but also as I write and advise on assistive cognitive technologies. I had only known a little about One Note. In fact, I had a conference call several months back with Microsoft's Accessibility division, and even they could not say or ""get"" how One Note might help persons who are challenged with memory and organizational issues. It has its own architecture quite different from other programs out there, yet having some semblence to the Microsoft line of products. On the good side, it is incredibly extensive it what I can do for those seeking to better coordinate all their documents, photos, email, notes, etc. On the down side, if you havent's worked with a program lie this before, you have a sizable learning curve in front of you. But I think its usefullness may far outweigh its time to master. I like its newer integration and voice/text synch and search capabilities with mobile phones. I have, however, noticed some performance issues and wonder if it could be clashing with other problems such as Live Search that I downloaded last year. I disabled that program as it wasn't worth the resources it consumed, and may not need to uninstall it due to potential conflicts. Overall I am very excited with One Note 2007, and expect I will find more usability and feature issues. But there is really nothing like it otherwise available."

I downloaded all the relevant documents and finally got help from their phone line. The fellow tried some things (most of which I had already tried) and decided the problem was with the Microsoft installer. (He didn't charge me, presumably because I had already tried everything myself.) I didn't believe that so I reinstalled Windows and tried the MS installer again and this time Norton successfully reinstalled. But I had the same problem with it messing up my machine. So once again I decided to try the for-fee phone support. The fellow tried to convince me it was a virus (no way!) and then said it might be a conflict with another program.

91451,1,"It's a ridiculously great price for so many comics that much is most definitely true. However, the scans were grainy and since it is only the Uncanny X-Men titles many of the story arcs (which often cross over to other titles) made chronological reading unpleasant.To sum up, It's more then 500 issues for 30$ so it's such a great price that it's almost too good to pass up."
16010,1,"Video Explosion Deluxe has a great heritage. Its nearly identical to Sony Screenblast Movie Studio v3 (both came from Sonic Foundry before Sony bought out their media division). It also bears a striking resemblance to Sony Vegas, a high-end professional editor. There's a lot of power built into this software, especially for the price. There's some excellent transitions, and the color-correction is quite good as well. The included clips are only so-so, but some may get a use from them. Rendering time seems a bit slow (usually takes 3x the length of the video to render it; ie: a 1 hour video takes 3 hours to render on an AMD 3200+ with 1 GB of RAM). But the rendering is excellent - no noticeable video noise added at all.My only concern is the lack of updates from Nova Development. They don't seem concerned with updating the software. When I bought this, for example, Ulead VideoStudio was on v6. Ulead's gone onto issue two more versions, and Nova's still on 1.3. Its still a better product than Ulead, but I'd like to see commitment."

81287,0,"First off, let me tell you that I'm not a pro at computers, or softwares. I'm just a regular person who likes to take pictures of my family and friends. I have been using Microsoft Digital Image Pro, and felt the need to move on to bigger and better things that allowed my creativity to grow. On various scrapbooking websites and magazines, I'd been hearing about Photo Impact. I took a chance and paid $70 bucks for it. After loading it on my PC, I was mortified. It's nothing like Micrsoft Digital Image Pro. It's way complicated! I couldn't even crop a photo in it. I know this is a great program, but it's too hard for regular people who found Adobe difficult to use. I've searched all of my scrapbooking sites for tutorials, and they're hard to find. Micrsoft Digital Image Pro, Jasc Paint Shop Pro, and Adobe have a lot more help for newbies. Right now, I'm using the Video Tutorial that comes with it, and I'm also reading the manual. Give me about 2 years. I'll get the hang of it eventually."

75979,0,"I was choosing between Norton and Mcafee and finally ended up with the latter since it was cheaper when I bought it. Everything worked out fine for the first 3 months. After that however, everything went wrong. It started with error messages whenever my internet explorer closes an adobe file. Then, it progressively got worse. Now, almost everytime I click a link which pops-up a new window, my explorer hangs. Thinking that it has something to do with ad-blocking and cookie-blocking, I disabled these features. But that did not work. I found out that holding down the control key while clicking a link solved the problem PARTIALLY. But then I got fed up with the still contionous hangs in the majority of websites I visit. Fortunately, I read somewhere in the reviews that most of the problems are caused by the privacy service included with the suite, so I uninstalled the privacy service and everything went back to normal. BOTTOM LINE: don't install the privacy service and just use the internet explorer's privacy settings instead. As for the firewall and virusscan, they get the job done."

This package is a great deal--you get the first five Nancy Drew games for the price of one. This is a good starter pack for a ND newbie before because not only is it very affordable, it includes several of the best games of the series, including my favorite, Treasure in the Royal Tower. Just be sure not to start with Secrets Can Kill (or if you do, don't base your opinion of the series on it). It was the very first one made and the quality is not very good. Happy sleuthing!"

91139,1,"Norns, the cute creatures you take care of, are artificial life. Creatures Labs has made the first (and only, so far) publicly released game like this. Norns have artificial brains they use to think for themselves, a bloodstream, digestive system and everything. All they do is their choice alone, not like a ramdomized list of things to do. They have a world to roam around in, can get disease, mate, have children and die. Each norn can speak to you, using their immense vocab. One, when it's hunger drive goes up, it'll find what it needs and announces it. &quot;Alice hungry for starch.&quot; Norns can say if they hate, dislike, like, or love eachother and have their own distinct personalities. They take good care of themselves through trial and error, and can remember things that've happened to them. Creatures 3 is by far the best yet, at a great price... It's been very succesful, I strongly suggest you use a search engine and find out a little, as that's the best way. Or their site @ creatures.com. Anyway, this game has a HUGE world to explore with top-of-the-line graphics and great smoothness, quick installation for it's size(11 minutes or so and you're ready to go!) Also problems are non-existant, unlike C1 and 2 that crashed alot. This game is also highly addictive and never gets boring, you'll look forward to seeing your favorite norns and their families every day. Age probably ranges 11 and up just since it'd be too difficult for younger ages. Don't mistake this for a kids game, it's quite interesting and complex. Many people have been messing with norn genetics to make cool hybrids. (like highlanders, named after the movie. These norns live forever.)The world they're in is ever-evolving, you can play with all the little animals around them and the game is full of neat stuff to explore. If you're interested at all, GET IT. (sorry for this thing's length, I love the game so much I get carried away...)"

73467,1,"I have been taking Japanese for a little under a year now; studying alone for a few years. I found that using RS in conjunction with my classroom studies is really amazing. I can spend a day studying vocabulary lists and not remember the words. Words I've used in RS are just engraved into my memory.I will admit, a large downside of this revolves around the lack of explanation. Japanese is very difficult to speak correctly, and a lot of honor tenses and words must be used. Also, if you have no prior knowledge of the particles and cannot read Hiragana/Katakana, it may be more difficult to learn. I would not recommend this alone for someone trying to learn to read/write Japanese.However, for the taught individual, this is an excellent study tool for your Japanese class."

Furthermore, I received $40 back on a TurboTax/Quicken bundle, and Intuit (the software company) is also giving me back the entire purchase price of the state version ($30), and the cost of e-filing.The beauty of TurboTax, of course, is that you will have an easier time in completing your taxes, while having resources ready to learn more about the tax code and lower your taxable income for next year.Please remember--the key to lowering your taxes is not simply crunching them after the fact.

21949,2,"I was trained on Microsoft products 15 years ago. I was very sensitive to the anger and ridicule friends and Mac users had for Microsoft. It's pretty hard for a company to go astray when they have brand allegiance from someone as naive as I used to be....unless you're Microsoft.I still very much dislike Macs, but after years of working with superior, more thoughtful non-Microsoft software (Adobe, Maya, Vectorworks) Microsofts problems are abundantly clear.For the first time in months I found myself needing to produce an all-text document last week, and I was really stunned. Now that I have more experience, my snooty Mac friends were right. Word really is a terrible product! As long as the only thing you need to do is place letters on a page one after another and want little control over any other aspect of producing a document, you'll be fine. Anything else is counterintuitive & headache inducing. It is inconceivable that Microsoft could have spent even a day on 'Clippy' the helpful (UNhelpful) talking paperclip annoyance, and still not have touched their assinine numbering and bullets tool. Or enhanced this piece of garbage so that you can actually position an image in a fixed place, with precise registration in a tight layout. But really the booby prize for the stupidest feature EVER designed into a piece of software is embedding the formatting of a paragraph into a hidden character at the end of some text. So WHATEVER YOU DO do not back over this invisible character, because a whole paragraph will instantaneously transform to a different format, perhaps even one you never put into the document in the first place.Isn't that ingenious (stupid) and helpful (infuriating)?I'm actually looking for a different word processor now and can't wait to delete this clunker from my system. The only company that cares less for how you use their product is (was) Polaroid, which deservedly filed for bankruptcy last year after sitting on their monopoly and producing truly awful products for 20 years."

61299,1,"I downloaded the free trial version of this software,Amplitube 2 DUO, which gives you limited amount of options. You only get 2 amps, 2 cabs, 2 mics, 2 effects, but that was sufficient to blow me away. I'm using my custom built computer with XP 2.5 gigs ram and SATA hard drives, the sound is an onboard chip. Which would make you think that the sound would be compromised, but this product is so good it doesn't need an extremely good card. The guitar is passed through an ART Tube MP Studio, which is a tube pre-amp with an 12AX7 tube(for warmth). The ART is then passed through a Lexicon Omega into the computer via USB. I get no latency at all, well at least nothing that would be decernable to the untrained ear. I haven't run it through loudspeakers, but the headphones I am using are adequate (don't want to scare the neighbors). I am definitly going to upgrade to the full product.

87483,1,"Being full-time rv'ers, hubby and I love using our new Microsoft Streets & Trips with GPS Locator. The program takes us ""door-to-door"" on our travels, and itineraries can be changed or adjusted when sightseeing opportunities occur unexpectedly. We are never lost, so we travel with confidence. Also, if a breakdown should occur, repair facilities can be easily located and mapped out. Restaurants, hospitals, parks, malls, etc., are all easily located. We will never again travel without this invaluable tool."
72279,1,"Now the guys from DATA BECKER have come out with Music Center Pro and have made some decent adjustments in style and technology. The terrible red interface is gone - now it's all silver and metal, the program is full 32-bit (now the filenames can be longer than 8 digits - thank you) and there are a lot of features that you normally have to pay much, much more for:Included Direct-X Effects supportGraphic Effects interfaceThe number of tracks (audio and midi) are doubled Video support3D Spatiauliser (looks good - but I'm not yet sure what's this for)and a full GM/XG midi support - to be honest, something I've not seen in ANY other package so far.I was very enthusiastic about MC and MC Pro certainly is a step upwards from there. The price for that kind of software is ridiculously low - but who am I to complain.It would be great if the other DATA BECKER software would be up to that standard, which it sadly is not.One more: Beginners beware: Buy the original MC first, MC Pro has too many features to make you happy when you're not already into HD-Recording and PC-Music Production."
43664,1,"I purchased this upgrade only because I was taking a required college course in how to use it. From the moment you open one of the programs such as Word or Excel, you KNOW there are differences. Everything looks different. I saw very few differences between say, 2000 and 2003 versions. If you are familiar with older versions, this one definitely takes some getting used to. However once you get the hang of where everything is located, it is much easier and far more intuitive than earlier versions. Don't install this the night before a big project is due, you'll get frustrated and probably never get your project done. Do install it when you have a little bit of time to play around with it and I think you will enjoy it immensely."
20841,1,I was given 6.0 as a gift 4 years ago and thought it couldn't get better. Then I updated to 9.0 and it got even better. I don't honestly use the cookbook sources provided with the software. I only use it to keep and retrieve my own favorite recipes. I find holiday and entertainment meal planning and shopping lists a breeze with the use of their 'menu' planning tool and automatic shopping list created from the recipes I simply click into the 'menu.' Recently I came across my old notebook stuffed with clipped recipes from years of magazine collections and realized how invaluable MasterCook software is in my life. I only input my personal favorites which now consist of over 125 recipes. The result is a cookbook I don't want to ever be without (sort of 'my' kitchen legacy). I especially appreciate the ease of inputting my personal notes from each preparation(and the names of guests I prepared it for). When a friend asks for a copy of my recipe it's a simple task to forward or print it.
44072,1,Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007I am well pleased with the total package after using a generic word processor downloade from the internet.The menu system is quite different than OFFICE 97 that I use at work. As I am getting used to the menu system I find it is quite easy to use and well thought out.
53526,0,"This is not a bad screen saver but if you're looking for a really authentic fish experience, there are better alternatives. The fish, particularly the smaller ones, don't render very well when they're perpendicular to the viewer (that is, when they're swimming towards or away from you). I've even seen them completely disappear. It's very apparent that the fish are basic models with simple photographic skins mapped to them; compared to the much more detailed fish in the SereneScreen Marine Aquarium, the shapes and motion of the fish are downright primitive. Although this is an OS X screen saver (NOTE: there's an Intel updater available for download), it doesn't follow OS X screen saver rules. To change the settings you have to launch a separate application rather than go through the OPTIONS button in the screen saver preferences. One interesting feature is the ability to follow the motion of a single fish; unfortunately I was unable to figure out how to STOP following the motion of a single fish. The only way I could get out of it was to change the tank configuration. Performance is mediocre at best; while I can easily get a dozen fish comfortably and smoothly swimming around with SereneScreen's Marine Aquarium (which has more complex structures and better detail) on my dual 2GHz G5 (with 4GB RAM and a 512MB video card), after six or seven fish I start to see jumping frames in AquaZone. Additionally, the fish don't always behave realistically; tetras, for example, school almost all the time, while in AquaZone they often behave like pretty much any fish, randomly swimming wherever it can go. Another gripe: The program limits your ability to customize the tank. While I understand the physiological requirement to not mix fresh and saltwater (or shallow and deep water) fish, this isn't a physical world. If I want my coelacanth to swim next to my neon tetra, or if I want my blacktip shark to have at a school of dwarf gourami, the program shouldn't stop me -- yet it does.I know that's a lot of negative so here's some positive: There are lots of fish and tank options, including some designed for wide-screen machines which are pretty interesting. The assortment of fish is very interesting, ranging from common freshwater favorites (goldfish, etc) to sea turtles, sharks and an assortment of jellyfish. (MISSING: Starfish, shrimps, crabs, and other crustaceans.) I also like the ability to add more fish and aquarium enhancements (toys, etc) to the show, although I think it's kind of greedy that you have to pay for them. If the quality of the fish/animation was better I would be more inclined to buy more, but not at this level."

19497,1,"I am not an artist but I have used both Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro. PSP is by far the easier, more intuitive and far cheaper product. I have used version 5, 6, 7 and they all are great. (MS photo editor and other tools are useless compared with this tool.)I have yet to find something I couldn't do. Certainly, some of the editting I have done took a while to figure out. But that was more a matter of figuring out what the operation was called to find it in help. If I was an artist I probably would know the right words. Once I find it in Help, the answer is clear with step-by-step guides.If you want to edit images, this is the tool. Note: If you are going to do a lot of editting, it is faster if your PC has a fair amount of RAM (no matter what product)."
92942,1,"This game is AWESOME! I have owned this game for quite a while and I find myself still playing it over and over. This game can be difficult for younger children and they may ask for your help. This games graphics are very pleasing to the eye with many colors. The music is not annoying or aggravating in any way. I enjoy how there are many things that you can click on for something to make a sound or little thing like that. The story is very humorous and intresting. There are many references to James Bond in this game and I am a huge James Bond so I thought that this was very funny. This game allows the player to use their memory. For example, they need to remember key places and certain items that they encountered in the game in order to advance in the future. All in all, this game is fabulous! A must have for any child or even the adult. Very fun!"
60466,1,"I can't believe there are NO reviews for this thing (as I write this)!I wanted this in mainly order to re-mix my favorite songs. I got pretty excited reading the box, and more excited when it arrived. I installed it and started running it and all of the sudden I found myself thinking ""uh-oh, this is wayyyy over my head."" But, like many programs, all you have to do is just start experimenting and playing around with it, and in no time, you will get the idea. The versatility this allows you to have with so many aspects of any track you import is incredible (and NO, I am not on Sony's payroll). The software comes with an honest-to-goodness, spiral-bound, hard-copy MANUAL! How rare these days! So you can be like me and take it to work to read on your breaks and then race home to try out the new techniques you read up on.The interface also has a ""How Do I...?"" button that covers a lot of varied functions, and it has a great, integrated, step-by-step approach that actually *teaches* you AS you do it. A great ""hands-on"" approach. I just can't begin to say how impressed I am at it's comprehensiveness and design. I sat with it for about 2 hours to do my first (serious) 4-minute-song re-mix, but when I was finished, I had a great track - all burned to inkjet-printed disc, and ready to give to my wife (it was one of her favorite songs).I like any software that actually allows me to *accomplish* something I really want to do, and this software did exactly that! Unless you're a super-techie who would stick his nose up at anything that runs with less than a $500 price tag, I think you'll be happy with this.I guess I should mention for those that want to *create* music from loops and so forth, it's still just as versatile, although you may not be happy with the 1001 loops included (oh well, buy the upgrade) - I am more than satisfied with them however, and will probably never use even a 3rd of them.Take Care and May God Bless You!James"
73699,1,My young teen absolutely loves this game. The graphics and the way things move are reminiscent of the video games we had when we were kids. Maybe not Pac-Man...but like an arcade style.I bought this as a surprise - my child had never indicated wanting it. It was a great choice and is used almost every day. He is enjoying this right now more than the really complex games he has. It's really quite simple - and doesn't use up all the space on your computer.
33918,0,"This is a great product for keeping your children off the internet! It definetly blocks their attempts to log on.

Other than that theirs alot of bells and whistles I don't know how to use or just don't understand how to use them."

39898,0,"We used this for the first time on a scenic drive through the mountains of Colorado and Utah. At first, the TomTom had an alarming tendency to bark instructions to leave the main road, and follow dirt tracks that looked as though they would need a 4WD. Since it came without any instructions, it took us some time to work out that it has no knowledge about heights of mountain ranges, and was sending us over them instead of round them.Also, it was sometimes difficult to pinpoint addresses of motels on long highways. You have to have a specific street address (zip codes won't do), and not all streets showed up.All was forgiven at the end though, when it navigated us faultlessly to the airport car rental desk at Denver, showing us a back way that ignored all the signs and got us there in good time. The information about which lane to take was very useful, and obviously couldn't be found on a paper map."

28060,0,"As you can see by the previous reviews, customers seem to either really love or really hate this program. Obviously, no utility can save, repair or salvage every hard drive. I wish one could.The positives:1. This program will help in certain, specific instances. If you do a net search and find that someone had the same issue/same symptoms as you and it worked, give it a shot.2. Fairly easy to use and straightforward as far as interacting with the actual program3. Can really save you from expensive data recovery services IN SOME CASESThe negatives:1. It really is ridiculously expensive for what you get...a piece of cardboard, a small piece of paper and a fairly flimsy looking DVD2. The company (Alsoft) seems to not really take care of their customers (see previous reviews). There are LOTS of issues with particular versions on particular machines. As of Jan. 1, 2009 these are still not completely resolved so be CAREFUL about using this latest version on some Macs.3. Obviously, it would be nice if you can see what kind of progress is being made. Yes, it's wonderful to have something fixed or recovered but you realize that when the process starts, you could be there for 20 minutes or literally be there for TWO days. And you don't really know until it's done. If it finishes at all.I'd like to see them drop the price even for just the updates to their customers. After all, you're literally buying a piece of cardboard, a piece of paper and a duplicated DVD. They could sell it for $49.00 and still make a killing. I realize they're not in the business of 'helping people' they're in the business of selling software but still...So basically, this will either save your hard drive or recover data and you'll love it or it will fail to save your hard drive or salvage data and you'll hate it. Either way, it's worth a shot even at $100. Why? The same reason they know they can price it at $100 and still sell it: You're DESPERATE. Most of these sales were made to frantic mac users trying to recover their work, files and memories. If you're here reading this review, chances are you're in the same state. When faced with losing years worth of files, data, work, photos, music, etc. Suddenly $100 doesn't seem like much, does it? Allsoft knows this and whether they fix your problem or not, they're going to let you know that they can definitely TRY to get you back up and running.So three stars...FIVE for the one disk of mine it kind of helped and -2 for the one it didn't and for the hefty price tag."
24620,2,I bought this software for my 5 year old who has 3+ years computer experience. Even at the easy level she had difficultities. I tried to work it but became easly discusted as it does not flow. I gave the CD's to a friend's daughter who is 8 1/2 and she said it is too hard so her brother who is 13 and a computer wiz and he did not like it. It is rated for a 5-10 year old. It makes no sense that software written for a 5 year old would satisify a 10 year old and vise versa.
57043,1,"Finally, when I get my digital scrapbook pages back from the printer they look like they did when I created them! I'm still having brightness issues, but the COLORS are there like I expect them. Very easy to install, doesn't take too long to go through the calibration process.My two issues I'm not thrilled with are that I can't get the brightness/contrast to look anywhere near where they say, and it requires me to recalibrate every two weeks. Popup reminders come up until I recalibrate, and that's too often for me (you can only adjust the reminders to more frequently).This is a great product for digital scrapbookers or amateur photographers who are having trouble between the colors they see on screen and what they get with their prints."

49375,0,"I got my Vista via the coupon program late last year.I was reluctant to upgrade because of the bad reviews.Lately my Dell E1705 is crashing to a blue screen a lot withhardware errors, and Dell wants me to reinstall the XP. So Ifigured why not upgrade to Vista and see what happens.The upgrade install process didn't take long, about an hour or two,and most programs came up working without needing reinstalls. Andthe system is quite stable.I have 6 PCs in the house, so I can experiment with one, it works fineas a standalone PC, my kids got on the Vista, so far I haven't heardany complaints from them about using it, all games seem to work, internet browsing is OK.Benchmarks are lower in Vista than XP, I used to get 3600 3Dmark06 for my7900GS, now 3400.The problems I have are with home netwoking, copying files from Vistato XP machines over home network crashes the XP machine, the Vista machine got an error but still functional. The files that got throughare all corrupted. I never had problems like that going from XP machinesto XP machines.Vista takes a lot of time calculating how much time it will take to copyfiles from PC to USB or the other way, it looks to me like it takes as much time to calculate than it takes to copy the whole thing in XP.Vista uses more memory, I am upgrading my RAM to 2GB now that I installedVista.I would recommend to run Vista with at least 2Gb Ram and a fast CPU,also a U3 stick for ready boost, turnoff User Account Control and minimize Windows Search items.At some point we have to upgrade to use more RAM, until then, wait.Update:I've used Vista for almost 2 months now. No crashes.Fairly easy to use, my kids use it, never asked me any questionson how to use it.Installation takes an hour, no need to reinstall any programs.All my programs work, even decade old programs.Downside is XP is a really solid product, hard to see any improvement,and it uses more RAM and other resources.It's a less painful upgrade than previous Windows upgradeWhy does Apple fantards have to spam Microsoft board?Go enjoy iphone with locked SIM card and sealed battery and last gen connection."
93917,1,"My experience is this, I bought an Iomega external firewire CD/RW that came with 'Hot Burn' Software. This software would not see the drive no matter what I tried, but my pinnacle studio software did. After giving up on Iomega support, I went and bought Easy CD 5 platinum. After the initial install it did not see the drive either, so I applied a patch to recognize more drives and bingo, everything works. Iomega is still contacting me to try and get me to uninstall all my cd/rw software to make the Hot burn stuff work. I am running Windows XP."
65534,1,It's all been good. Install is easy and it didn't even need download files to update the boxed software. That's very rare these days especially on Vista. Of course on the Vista side there are always new files to update the program. But the important point is that I found Creator 9 to be workable right away.The features are really packed in. I've been using the roxio site for pickin up general capabilities. Also the boards are helpful to zoom into any particular tasks. Most tasks though are easy enough to figure out alone though. I was able to burn 2 disks at once. I should also note that I'm not really a pc proficient user.At first I thought that the VideoWave editor was too complex for me. But then I ready at the Roxio site how to remove ads from tivo files. It made me less wary of trying to do more things in the program. I'm glad I did because now I can be more creative with videos. It also made me aware of how much you can do to make playable media for phones. Besides cutting out ads I also learned how to compress files. I'm surpised how much my phone can hold now. So thanks to Creator 9 I'm utilizing my phone's media functions much more. I'm also catching up on watching videos while I travel.
87726,1,"I grew up pumping quarters into arcade games in game rooms and arcades all over town and actually all over the country. This Atari Anniversary Edition CD contains 12 arcade classics from Atari. Here are the games:1. Asteroids2. Asteroids Deluxe3. Battlezone4. Centipede5. Crystal Castles6. Gravitar7. Millipede8. Missile Command9. Pong10. Super Breakout11. Tempest12. WarlordsThis doesn't run on Windows 7, unfortunately. It runs on Windows 95, 98, and ME. As you can see, this is kind of an old CD, released in 2001. It requires Pentium 133 MHz or higher, 16 MB of RAM, a 4X speed CD-ROM drive, and a 2 MB or higher SVGA card. The game will play right from the CD, so no hard disk space is required.If you remember these classic games and have an older computer, then this CD should work fine."

72034,0,"I am a professional retoucher and have used Aperture, Lightroom, Capture One Pro, RAW Developer and Bibble Pro extensively but I can barely stand to use Bibble Pro because the interface is so impossibly broken that it makes it a chore to use. I've used niche 3-D software developed by programmers with a complete disregard for usability and not found it as frustrating to use as this program - which I want to love since it produces very good results, especially when combined with Noise Ninja Registered. If you are wondering what I mean about bad interface design, it all has to do with how the panel stacking tries to be customizable but just ends up in all sorts of weird configurations of doubled panes, wasted space and any time you would save by Bibble Pro's fast processing is instantly gobbled up by the constant fixing of crazy configurations you will inevitably find these in. I anxiously await a new interface design that doesn't feel like it was spat out of the bowels of a sadist. Then, maybe I'll drop some coin on this capable app."

If YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS this DVD should work and look fine BUT you need to use Adobe 8 to avoid having to enlarge it to 150 percent [with A8, 75 percent is all I needed to read it comfortably] I used Adobe 8 and got clear, crisp, clean as the original hard copy scan images and as I had the suggested programs running I found the DVD worked efficently. So enough of the cheap shots people when all fails....."

36297,1,"Trend makes an antivirus product that is effective, easy to use and stops email attacks before they can gain access to your computer. While some antivirus software brings things to a crawl PC-Cillin 2000 uses the smallest amount of system resources of any antivirus progarm I have found. You can completely control everything the software does, using one of the best interfaces on the market. It has several scans you can select, the product popups and warnings can be even be determined by the user. The system scans are very fast and automatic. More than twice as fast as Norton. It works well on any Windows Operating System, and Trend allows XP and other Window users to evaluate the software for a month for free which includes virus updates. Finally...you get the CD at a very good price if you have a hard drive problem or change computers it is there for you to use. The technical support using email is excellent if you need to send a virus package for evaluation."
66847,2,"I heard about Paperport from word of mouth. I've spent a number of hours researching the product, emailing tech support, and reading reviews from leading publications and users. It appears most users dogged technical support, so I took the test myself and emailed tech support to see if they support my HP all-in-one machine (OfficeJet G55). Support responded within 48 hours unlike the remarks I've read where they received poor tech support at unreasonable response times.At any rate, I opened and loaded the software on my Toshiba XP enabled laptop. Installation was easy, and without reading the instructions manual, I was able to easily create folders and scan documents. PaperPort easily recognized my scanner.In terms of software, this purchase has to rank among the most value received as my desk is becoming less of a paper pile and more of a desk. The quality of the scan is pretty good too, even capturing the creases of folded papers.I highly recommend this product as the use and ROI of my scanner is in full swing with the use of PaperPort.NOTE:Recently downgraded to 2 stars due to software using 100% CPU and crashing my laptop. (laptop turns off) I have a 1.13GHZ P4 with 512MB RAM and the CPU utilization of the software is too heavy intensive!!"

No one else uses my computer and if you have this software you should password protect your computer."
3612,1,Roxio emc8 is a huge program so maybe some people will have some problems. Luckily I didn't have any problems and I installed the full program. It does take a lot of disc space so you have to check that your pc can handle that. After installing I burned lots of dvds and cds easily. All the discs came out fine. I've used Nero software in the past and that worked too. Yet if you look at the Nero reviews they are even worse than the ones here. Instead of evaluating the software fairly some users are writing that the programs don't work at all. Are these people angry? I'm now wary of negative user reviews and will look at magazine and tech site professional reviews.

23331,0,"This new version of QuickBooks PRO is not as good as the previous one that I owned. The new interface is boasted as better organized. However, once you get past it, confusion ensues. I found the new payroll steps very confusing. Payroll items appear differently for each employee; they don't stay in order as you go from window to window. A/R still can't give you a payment history for customers.Beware: Intuit stops supporting payroll updates periodically so that you MUST upgrade. That's why I bought this dog! If my CPA weren't committed to this product, I would have changed to Peachtree."
32763,0,"How it works: load the software onto your computer then open the application which is pretty much a map of the world. The world map is made up of many small map files that are mostly 5 degrees by 5 degrees. Many of the ""map blocks"" over the ocean contain no data, but show up as 1k files. select all the areas, then upload to your GPS via usb cable. You cannot load the whole world, because the number of blocks exceeds the GPS capacity. By not selecting most of the oceans, everything else should fit. I put a 2GB micro SD card in my eTrex HCx. Don't know if the map files are loaded into the GPs built in memory or the memory card. Uploading the max number of maps takes about 30 minutes. Once done, your GPS will take about 1 minute to load all the map files into main (?) memory everytime you turn your GPS on, so you will probably only want to upload the map areas you are likely to use on your trip.Map quality: Map detail is low to poor, depending on area. For instance, in a major US city, the freeways, interstates and MAJOR roads only will be shown. Coast lines are decent, and generally better than the base map. Another example: Tahiti, NO roads are shown at all. Some geographic features (a couple dozen) are shown. the topo lines are in 1000' increments, so for all practical purposes, useless.Summary: A pig in a poke. Depending where you are going it may add something useful or not. Personnally, I think a good value price for this product is about $50 US."

The scope is wonderful - a taste of the architecture, the art, and the history.You must understand that I am of the older generation - we were stuck with expensive books or saving for these trips.

48243,0,"This is not the jewel in the crown of the Magic School Bus CD series (Animals, for example is much better), but it does have some good features. In particular, the activity on ozone & the greenhouse effect is excellent- our 2nd grader really grasped the concept after playing with it for a while.The plot, however, is to find Ms. Frizzle, which our kids found frustrating. You get clues by earning tokens from an arcade-type game- the only MSB title we've seen that requires you to play an arcade game in order to complete it. It may be that the Microsoft progammers figure that space=boys=arcade game, but our kids were annoyed about it. They were even more annoyed when they worked out from the 1st clue where she was and found out that you have to get all 3 clues anyway.On the other hand, kids who like arcade games might be induced to learn a bit about the solar system."

The basics of making your track that you can export to a remixer like traktor, reason or fruitloops. Ihaven't seen a tempo set yet , that might be one drawback.. The files are in PDX form, specific to the program , you can't go in and lift the sample wav's like you can on MAudio Prosessions. ( in case you didn't know that trick, programs not suited to your OS necessarily need to be 'installed' to be of use) .Also , for USA buyers, chose the brit flag for english language or you'll have a Rosetta stone moment. Theres' no instructions with it.For what it says it is; you might consider this a 5. Its user interface screen is self explanatory , reminiscent of an ol' skool commodore 64/atari game console.

49995,1,"Interface refinements are quite noticeable in some places, and subtle in others. All are welcome. As a whole, the interface feels much more refined and 'tighter' than Tiger.The only downside to the upgrade are some applications (very few, probably none for most users) fail to work, and there have been a number of quirky bugs present which the 10.5.1 upgrade fixed most of. Some bugs still present, but nothing critical. Gmail in Safari isn't working so well. I've switched to Camino (www.caminobrowser.org).If you're a person who cares about interface refinement, than I'd recommend upgrading. If you're a person who can't tell the difference between Windows 95 and 98, upgrading from Tiger to Leopard won't make a difference to you at all."
40651,1,"When upgrading from Mny 2004 to Mny 2005 my mutual fund summary totals got messed up. Further software version updates never fixed the problem. With that in mine, I test installed the 2006 software on my spare computer and loaded the data via a backup file. All went well and the numbers do seem to add up this time around. Otherwise very litte has changed with the new 2006 version of Mny. They made a few changes to the screen display such as removing the date from some screen displays or putting boxes and titles side by side rather than stacking them on the screen. I also noticed they added an additional tab on the investment screen which has to do with the display grouping function. Otherwise I dont see any big changes. 2004 had an investment display feature which allowed me to position the cursor on an investment by hitting the first letter of the investment symbol. I was hoping that feature might be returned for 2006. I think the investment reports could be better, but overall, I think the product is good."

FTM 16 was the pinnacle and they went down hill from there. Why ""upgrade"" with real ""downgrades""? Change should contain improvements not change just for the convenience of company management who is constantly watching the bottom line or is just not familiar with the needs of the consumer. They obviously lost a tremendous amount of market share. My suggestion to FTM is to hire technical people who know genealogy and let them develop the best possible product starting with the FTM 16 platform."

The thumbnail reference is just as good if a wee bit tedious. I am waiting for 2 million cliparts to come with a further improved thumbnail browser based on subject categorization besides 1,000,000 on colour print. A wishlist - Is it possible to get rest of clipart on cd? I do not mind having another 28 cds for the next 500,000 clips. Less tedium than downloading from website the rest."

39588,1,"be warned: many games, even games from other genres, will seem lackluster after playing this one. some of my favorite games that seemed oh so great now seem oh so shoddy compared to this masterpiece. every encounter, challenge and problem in this game can be solved in so many ways it's ridiculous. at some point i started feeling giddy every time i came across a challenge, wondering what secret i'd discover or what clever / zany / funny solution i'd come up with.personally i thought the graphics on the characters was the only drawback - the people walk in this kinda jerky, unrealistic fashion. they don't look like they ""match"" the otherwise nice cityscape graphics. however i forgot about this completely about one hour into game play, because i was too fascinated by the complexity of the world.i definitely plan to play the game a second time, and i think i could probably get 3 runs through out of the game since you can make your character totally different each time by picking different cybernetic augmentations and skills.if you enjoy smart, challenging gameplay that requires thought, strategy and effort, make sure you pick up a copy. for this quality of game entertainment it'd be a steal at twice the price."
64760,1,"Flex Builder combines with the open-source Eclipse IDE to provide a computer language for describing web pages that may contain eye-popping renderings of graphs (pie, column, bar) and charts (datagrids). You can easily include videos in your pages. Graphs and charts can zoom, transition with wipes and fades, and they render in stylish modern colors. They bind to data that may be sourced from web services, over the Internet from XML files, and from files on your very own LAN or local computer. The documentation follows the industry standard, which is to say it isn't very good. You'll search for days for answers to your questions. The code appears to be rock solid. Eventually you get to a point where it all begins to make sense. That's on account of your effort. There is a large user community. All-in-all: a valiant effort that succeeds more than it fails. The only reason I mark it down is because of the documentation. I have seen much worse. This is only slightly above average."

One of the nicest features in this version of OmniPage, is the ability to work with Adobe PDF files. PDF files are great, but have little editing ability. With OmniPage Pro 11, this is no longer an issue. All I need to do now, is convert my PDF file to an Office file and edit away! This feature is almost worth the full price. In addition, OmniPage Pro 11 is far more accurate than OmniPage 10 ever was, and with added features OmniPage Pro 11 will work better than ever before.

It seems that Intuit has taken a page from the monopoly playbook and is forcing institutions to upgrade to the QFX standard. However, Intuit is charging institutions considerable price for this upgrade. I think the price is something like $3 per account, not per $3 institution bank account that uses an Intuit product. For a bank with 50,000 account names, this would translate into a $150,000 payment for Intuit. Going forward, I would expect for more institiutions to take the path of Fidelity and not adopt the new standard. Think about it, if you were a bank technology director would you pay this amount for service that was used by perhaps 15% of your banking clients?"

19055,1,I purchased this sd card for a trip I had planned to Scotland. This little SD card was the best thing I bought for this trip. We spent 3 weeks driving around Scotland and it always got us to our chosen destination. If it hadnt been for this little card we would have never been able to see as much as we did. Having the GPS took allot of stress out of driving in a foreign country. I also used it in pedestrian mode while we were in edinburgh to get to places there. My husband and I would have never survived our trip still speaking to each other without this wonderful tool. If you are planning a trip and you will be driving just spend the money and enjoy your trip. It is the best money you will ever spend.
39581,1,"Deus Ex is a fantastic game. The single player storyline is fascinating, drawing one into the story. And you don't want to leave. This game, a combination of heroin and Godzilla, pulled me in, and wouldn't let me out, devouring whole weekends and hours of free time. The gameplay is a lot of fun, and is very open-ended. Many games talk about how there's the option of sneaking in or running in with the guns blazing, but this is the only game where you can see real direct effects of those choices. Run in with an assault rifle and you'll have a lot of corpses lying on the floor. But due to that gun's recoil, one guy runs off long enough to hit an alarm sounder. Suddenly dozens of guards and security robots swarm the area. You're dead very quickly. Everything you do has consequences. Characters in the game will react differently to whether you run into an area and slaughter everyone in sight or slowly approach, and take them alive instead. Because of every choice changing the game, there's a high replayability level to see what would have happened if you had done things differently. The inventory system, the nanotech augmentations (special abilities you can gain) and the skills system (completing objectives gets you skill points, which let you become better in certain areas such as electronics, ability with weapons, and lockpicking) are all intuitive and simple. Bottom line: This is a great game, and you will enjoy it."

Systemworks slowed me down too much and were not even 100% compatible with its earlier version of internet security. I don't think systemworks works for me any way. By comparison, System Mechanic 6 does do a much much better job. It makes my computer run faster and so easy and fast to install and I like it a lot. I will recommend whoever wants to buy a similar product to go to the manufacture's website and try it to test if it works for your machine. For those who don't have time to do the test, I suggest you buy SM6.For those who already has antivirus or antispyware that you are used to, this is the utility software that does the job and you won't feel the difference except running faster after you installed it."
25258,1,"I apologise to Ron Popeil and his cooker, but this system is really that easy! By far the easiest to install and use among Norton's and MacAfee products. I have been running it with XP for a few months now. I first used it as a Beta release with my XP RC 2 copy, then installed SystemWorks 2002 after I installed the XP final product. It has caught several viruses so far, handled them perfectly and automatically. Upates are downloaded and installed automatically in the background while you are online. What more could a person want? If you have an old clunker, you can disable the background updates. Buy this product and you won't have to worry."
41025,1,"This game is SO much fun! I think the idea of having a virtual pet that can actually breed is a sweet idea! The very first time my cat got pregnant I was totally happy! Any way, this CD was a great idea, because if your really wishing for a pet but you can't have one, then this is the CD for you! You can treat your cat just like a real one by: dressing it up, feeding it, teachingit tricks, and breeding it!The bottom line: ITS GOOD!"

The language cd offers 3 other languages but I have yet to hear her say a word in any other language. She has already mastered the alphabet which is good because this really does not teach the alphabet just arbitrarily some letters throughout the game. I do not really think it is worth the $29.99. I gave it 3 stars because she seems to like to play with it and 1)it is better than tv and 2) I am sure she is learning something."
62224,1,I like this program because it is easy for small ones to use. I have a 20 month old and a 4.5 year old. They both love this game.

Don't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start. So far, I have not noticed a dime's worth of difference from the Pro version. It is working great.However, the Vista coupon shipped with my package expired on March 15, 2007.

58360,0,"I had no trouble operating the software, and it consistently appeared to perform the task of overwriting all portions of my hard drive. The problem, though, is that when the program cleans or verifies that the drive is clean, it displays only a percentage of the space on the hard drive, rather than the amount of space. Because I got the program for the purpose of permanently eliminating malware on my drive, I never knew if Wipedrive was able to clean that part of the drive. Wipedrive offers no means for examining the raw data on the drive or for determining the total space that it verifies is clean. Also, even with an average size 80 GB drive, each overwrite takes an extremely long time, as does the verification routine. You can clean only the entire hard disk and cannot limit it to one drive or partition. It would be helpful if you could selectively clean and/or scan only a portion of the drive, or scan from the end instead of from the beginning. In sum, the product seems well designed for a routine, single cleaning to eliminate personal data on an entire hard disk, but its lack of options left me wondering if it had done the job for me. A partition manager plus one of the free downloads (such as Eraser) could be a better choice in some situations."
60869,2,"Recommend avoiding this version. There are still many ""new"" boxes of OLD software (like produce) for sale out there.

18846,0,"UPDATE 12/2/20121. BibleWorks asserts its customer support logs contain no evidence of my having tried to contact them (it happended over a year ago); and2. Immediately after learning through this Amazon review of my complaints, BibleWorks contacted me and has resolved these complaints to my satisfaction. (Support has definitely improved - my emails are now ALL responded within 48 hours and telephone messages are also responded via email - but don't expect any one at BibleWorks to answer the phone or return your phone calls or offer any live chat ... YET. However, I am impressed with the seriousness of their commitment to improving customer service and applaud their current trajectory which hopefully, some day, will include telephone support or at least live chat, in all its glory).UPDATE 11/13/2012I was contacted by email by the customer support GM. He offered to help solve the problems I was having by directing me to the FAQ forum. He did not include his phone number with his offer of ""help.""I responded:Your product support was more than a dismal failure.And I bought the whole thing TWICE plus add on modules.I hope no one else buys it once until effective support is implemented.He responded by pointing the finger at me for not resolving my issues myself using the FAQ forum, etc.I responded:BibleWorks did not support the products I bought and that includes two complete BibleWorks packages along with several add-on modules purchased with my first edition that I have never gotten to work with the upgraded edition, in spite of paying for two full editions, not merely an upgrade.You state disingenuously that your ""phone logs"" show no correspondence whatsoever from me. This omission pretty much says it all, since your ""phone logs"" have nothing to do with customer telephone support, do they?I see you didn't mention any lapse in records of my purchases or include any offers of refunds for your non-functional software!Furthermore, your email, unlike the many emails I receive from responsible vendors, also has NO CONTACT PHONE NUMBER. Real customer support PHONE LOGs related to PHONE CALLS, not to correspondence, as referenced in your email.Once again, your company failed to provide any phone support or any other support for my newly purchased product in the face of my multiple requests for support. If this woefully deficient customer service paradigm has changed, please correct me with your published customer support phone number. But please don't pretend you support your product when it is, in fact, your policy to just take the money and run.Have you ever called the Logos Bible software folks? If not, you may want to give them a ring to see what REAL Christian software support looks like. However, it is of course always easier than actually solving customers' problems to simply point the finger at them, charge them with just not having written or called, after spending hundreds of dollars on your dysfunctional products, than to actually do some work to support your product like the LOGOS Software people do.Once again, your unprofessional email response pointing your finger at me along with your inadequate contact information unfortunately harmonizes with your sadly misnamed product, because BibleWorks doesn't.THEIR IS NO, ABSOLUTELY NO, TELEPHONE SUPPORT. THEIR IS NO LIVE CHAT SUPPORT. EMAIL SUPPORT HAS IT'S OWN SET OF HURDLES AND PROBLEMS. I NEVER GOT MY BW 7 FULLY FUNCTIONAL BECUASE OF THE SUPPORT HURDLES. ONE STAR BECAUSE SUPPORT IS NOT COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER SOFTWARE VENDORS PLUS OTHER ROADBLOCKS FRUSTRATING INSTALLATION AND USE OF THEIR SOFTWARE. LOGOS AND A COMPETING WINDOWS PRODUCT MAY BE VIABLE SUBSTITUTES ...I own BW 7 along with several investments in add-on software for it that I bot from them all installed on an old, failing, XP computer.So i bot this new hp windows 7 computer. After many hours, I concluded it was a completely frustrating waste of my time, practically impossible to move my BW 7 including my investment in significant extra BW7 software modules to my new computer. (Probably by design, huh?)So I bot BW 8 hoping I could install it and then move the extra modules I previously bot for BW 7 over to it.The ""system"" frustrated me in my initial attempt to EVEN register my BW 8! i cannot register because the registration ""system"" only allows one product to be registered per account. so the first question is how to register my new product since I now own two, apparently entitling me to twice the level of what passes for BW customer support?I am currently challenged with rising above my disgust with the frustrating waste of my time to simply move my BW 7 to Windows 7 at this point.This disgust is intensified by the frustration and waste of my time trying initially and unsuccessfully to register BW 8 since registration apparently accepts ownership of only one version, not to mention the extra fun of typing in the activation code for a third time as part of registration even though the product has already been activitated. I am close to givig up and returning BW 8 to the campus computer store where I bot it.It would seem they are throwing up an inordinate number of hurdles to make it impossible to move BW resources to upgraded computers. This serves to make their product technologically obsolete to the first enterpenaour to offer similar resources in a cloud computing environment completely eliminating the portability problem.Using the Talbot library version is quickly becoming an option after I return this unusable product due to failure to transfer to windows 7.Now owning two copies of their software I could scarcely be more disappointed in trying to simply register and have the software recognize and make the resources I have already bot functional on my new computer.If you can suggest any way to make BW work with the extra modules I bot, I will give it a final last try. But frankly, I'm praying for a cloud computing option that eliminates this in the future.keith sharpPhone number given (not that you would ever talk to a customer to guide them thru YOUR rat maze to actually get BW functioning ...)"

(She has Windows 98) Plus the music was just...depressing. I recommend this for someone who ddoesnt mind losing all the time.Version 2 crashed on my computer(I have Windows ME), and my friends computer. If it ever started, everyone would die like right away. And it played really creepy music when someone died. My sister cried and it gave me the shivers. Of course, you would never make it to Oregon or even Great Salt Lake City before you die or get fired. This one, maybe 14 and up?Version 5 is the best. It was a lot more stable on both of our computers (mine and my friends) and was really fun. I could make it to Great Salt Lake City and Sacramento but not Oregon. It didn't crash, everyone would just die before you even got to Fort Hall. My younger brother could make it though. Ages 7-107."

25512,1,"I don't know how many times I have been sent viruses over the last year, but it would have to be nearly a 1000. If you use email like I do, you are definitely no stranger to viruses that lurk around every corner in cyberspace. Norton saved me plenty of times and the 40 or so dollars you spend on this product is worth its cost 50 times that because of what a virus can do to a computer without you knowing it. If I didn't have this software, who knows how much I would had to have spent fixing my system.Norton is probably the premier choice when it comes to anti-virus software. I've experimented with others and find this company to offer the best and most easy to use system. 2003 is not too different from 2002 as everything is basically the same. The layout menu has slightly changed (more so in color), but everything is the same. Newer virus definitions have been added and the update feature is easy to use and navigate. Norton makes their software easy to configure unlike their competitors which I find handy especially when I want to tell the system what I want it to do instead of the software telling me what to do. You can't go wrong with Norton!"

Prior to the update I could not get the program to connect with my eTrex Legend. Anyway, all owners of this product should visit [the website] -- some good freebies available for download.The most valuable maps are the 7.5 inch -- which have incredible detail. (I DON'T KNOW IF THESE ARE AVAILABLE IN THE US PRODUCT -- I doubt it). Copying the CDs for your area to the hard drive will save having to constantly load CDs ---- if you have the memory available.The product functionality is fantastic -- I particularly like the ease of building an elevation profile. Transferring back and forth between a GPS is a breeze. If you hike, or mountain bike this is a great product."
3221,1,"I was originally using Rosetta Stone's Chinese program through online subscription. I went several times through the entire program before I decided that monthly subscription was getting expensive and since I enjoyed going over this program very much I finally decided to purchase it.The online version has Chinese only written with pinyin and I was a little bit disappointed that it didn't have Chinese characters anywhere. When I received the package, I was thrilled and delighted to find that it had two books included and the books had all the material written both with Chinese characters and pinyin. This has taken my enjoyment of this program to a new level.I do need to add that I have purchased numerous other books and programs, so this is not the only one I have been using - and the other books and programs have helped me tremendously in using this one.Working with the entire Pimsleur program first has helped me tremendously in working with Rosetta Stone, as did many other books that deal with grammar and writing. Also, among different dictionaries, one of my favorites is Wenlin's electronic dictionary as well as NJStar program. Yes, getting all of these programs can get pricey, but they are all well-worth it, especially if you're learning Chinese on your own. They will serve you for a long time and will make the arduous process of learning Chinese a breeze, allowing you to progress easily and to enjoy the process."

4253,1,"Laplink provides a simple way to synchronize two computers. The synchronization can be performed through the internet or through a USB2 cable (provided). Im hoping they go to firewire at some point; that should definitely be on their agenda.In all, it is very easy to make sure that two computers have the same files. We use it to keep essentially one computer as a backup of the other. You can easily select which directories need synchronization, and how to synchronize them (one way, overwrite, etc). Pretty simple and easy to use interface; it take no time to learn how to use it. It even has a virus checker for transferred files which can come in really handy.This program can be an absolute lifesaver. It can be a simple way of transferring data from an old to a new computer for example. You could use it to synchronize outlook, but it would take some extra steps; you are better off going to an exchange server if that is your goal.If you are looking for a cheaper option Id recommend a program called Foldermatch. It is shareware (~$35) and does essentially the same thing but it is a little more rigid and a bit slower."

You have to take care of her the entire game until she is well, then you get to go on all of the other adventures. You play as Spirit, and you have to constantly stop the necessary tasks to rescue the other members of the herd to go and tend to Rain. It was really a huge disappointment. Loading time stinks, too.

Version 12 seems like a step in the right direction as it radically changed the GUI and allowed the adoption of Illustrator concepts. Let's hope Corel gets the message and continues the improvements.I must admit that V12 at least makes a good attempt to revive the efficacy of Designer V8. For the most part, the filter export and import translators work reasonably well. Corel FINALLY decided to give us a 3-point parabolic stretch tool in V12. Not having it in V10 was embarrassing for this high priced ""graphics"" program.Like it or not, with the demise of Igrafx, the Corel illustration program is just about all we have out there for professional graphics under $2K.

57254,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

33999,1,"HerInteractive's games are always great, and this one is no exception. In the past few games, they have greatly improved any bugs in the games and carefully checked that everything made sense. This is why I have been glued to Nancy Drew games for the past couple of years.The setting/graphics are fantastic!! It is set in the romantic Old West at beautiful Shadow Ranch. Graphics are nice, any movements and characters look truly real. I like that and give setting/graphics 5 stars.The plot is nice. You aren't really expecting what is yet to come, and the plot is not fully accomplished until after a while, but that is okay. You figure it out eventually. Nancy tries to figure out why a phantom horse is haunting innocent Shadow Ranch. At same time, you are trying to find the treasure hidden by an outlaw named Dirk Valentine to his girlfriend, Frances Humber. Double-plot that is a little confusing I have to say I would generously give it 4 stars.Ah, the characters. Each one is different and none of them really like each other. Three of them are ranch hands and another one owns a shop near the ranch called Mary's Gifts. One you don't meet in person is a romance novelist who helps you throughout the game.Shorty Thurmond is the jolly cook at the ranch. The other two hands seem to really hate him, but that doesn't make him quiet and unfriendly. He is constantly trying to gossip with Nancy, though she tries to shake him off. Shorty's lively personality makes it hard for you to hurt his feelings. An excellent character in the game, definitely.Dave Gregory is the shy, quiet ranch helper. He is attractive, (I found myself staring at him more than once!) the total opposite personality as Shorty, and develops a small crush on Nancy about halfway through the game. He doesn't think your personality matters, just as long as you are a good helper, you are all good in Dave's mind.Tex the Terrible, (as I like to think of him) is ornery and mean. Tex believes Nancy is a city girl that should be in her ""nice, warm beddy-bye"" rather than visiting the country, and Shadow Ranch in particular. Nancy proves him wrong though, so he is a wee bit nicer in the end.Mary Yazzie owns Mary's Gifts, is Indian, and kind. Her relationship with the Rawleys (the owners of the ranch) is pretty rough, though, but she likes Nancy and helps her many times. Good, strong character.Charleena Purcell helps Nancy with facts she needs to know about Shadow Ranch, some of its previous residents, and its secrets as well. Helpful, filled with facts, and known for her romance books is basically all that she is. I enjoy Purcell being in the game, and you meet her in game #13, Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon!!All characters are likable, but I am bothered that you don't spend much time with them, but spend more of the time hunting on your own and roaming the dusty roads of Arizona on horseback. This brings my average character tally to 4 stars, sadly.One thing I dislike in this game are the many various chores you are given!! From patching the chicken coop wire to making a campfire to putting a bridle together, the chores are annoying and I find them as a big flaw in the game. I really wish they would have carefully considered putting them in the game more than they probably did, but that doesn't ruin the game, so don't not buy it because of this flaw. I just thought it was something to point out.The puzzles are good. They are related to the game but are more kind of guessing and require lots of thinking and start-overs, rather than being explained carefully somewhere else. They are fun to figure out even still, so I'll give them 4.5 stars.Wow, the ending is super, super confusing!! You have to find your way through a maze while collecting little wooden keys along the way, and the keys are sometimes off the trail. I like the fact that the culprit is a little bit surprising, though, and you feel all the better when you find your way through the case and solve the maze. The ending deserves 5 stars since it is unexpected, slightly creepy, and the puzzle is confusing, the way I personally believe it should be!!There is a cool feature in the game- the cell phone. This is not the first game it has appeared in, but I think it is neat and makes the game more realistic. Good job, HerInteractive!!Now, for the final tally:Setting/Graphics- 5 starsPlot- 4 starsCharacters- 4 starsPuzzles- 4.5 starsEnding- 5 starsTogether, that is an average of 4.5 stars, but since you can't do 4.5 on the rating thing, I will give it an even 4. I rounded it down instead of up since the things I didn't like I rated generously anyway.Overall, it is a good game that I have played over and over. I just feel like in a review, I have to be critical so you really know what you are buying.Thanks for reading this!!"
36485,1,"OK. I don't normally waste my time writing these reviews, but ResumeMaker deserves some of my time. I am a general sales manager for a techology company and I already had a resume before I purchased this software (I wanted to take advantage of the Internet job search features) but I was shocked that it helped me improve my resume as much as it did. Last week I had to choose from 5 job offers - I'm happy. I rated this software with 5 stars, it helped me a ton.Char."

I have to make her get off the computer! She goes back again and again and clicks items two or three times to practice the words. Well worth the money, and mom is learning too!"
94118,0,"Just a few things to remember before installing this product. In no particular other:1. remove other versions of cd-writer software.2. disable the virus scanner before installation.3. buy REV B. of the software. (see bottom of box).4. read article 010426-000000 &amp; 000929-000005 on the roxio website.5. backup your registry and make a startup disk.The installation didn't go smoothly at all for me as I have previous versions of HP packaged software installed. After initial installation, it crashed at startup. When I finally got it working, the included software was a great improvement over the HP mycd. Using Soundstream, I was able to listen to each chosen mp3 files as I was arranging the playlist. It also give the option to finalize the cd or not. The video and photo software was fairly easy to use. Using the photo software I was able to generate an autorun slideshow of my kids with a background music.If it wasn't for the lousy installshield, I might have rated it higher. Good luck."

94075,1,"Easy CD Platinum's main purpose in my computer is to back up the hard drive. What are you gonna do when you get that virus, or Boom, lightening strikes and your computer is sizzling because you forgot to get a surge protector? Are you gonna cry? Or are you gonna say, &quot;Well atleast I saved my hard drive!&quot; You don't need to loose those pictures, or that paper your working on. If you have or are planning on getting a burner, and think its best to back up your hard drive...Easy platinum is the easy way to get it done. Nuff said."
39053,1,"ChemTutor Excalibur is excellent. It teaches with correct, concise, and marvelously clear explanations of everything you need to know in Chemistry. The diagrams, tables, and definitions that ChemTutor Excalibur provides are so clear, focused, and well written. They get right to the point and explain concepts better than my slick, overpriced textbook did. I recommend ChemTutor Excalibur to anyone who is currently taking, or plans to take, a chemistry course."
48466,1,"I was very satisfied with the software I purchased through Amazon.com. While I contacted Sage directly to get a replacement cd for the one I originally purchased and misplaced, they told me that they no longer had the 2007 version cd. They wanted to me to upgrade to the 2010 software which would have cost me over $1,200.00. Thankfully, Amazon.com had the 2007 version I needed and cost me much less and it worked perfectly for what I needed. Therefore, I suggest that everyone check Amazon.com before purchasing anything. Thanks Amazon!!"

55857,0,I have used the ProSeries product (the professional version of TurboTax) for several years and tried TurboTax this year. My biggest complaint is that the product is difficult to navigate around because you can only go to the forms or the interview screens. It's a pain to go back and change something because you have to go through the entire interview from the beginning.
53385,1,"After Little Mermaid, my two girls couldn't get enough of this swimmer. We've had so much use of this CD that it is worn out and will be purchasing another. My 5 yr old especially loves the chase around the iceberg game. The 3 yr old just loves seeing Melody during any of the games and hearing her voice."
63999,1,This is the best accounting software that we have used. I am so glad that we found it. It makes our jobs super easy.
14302,1,This was an update to previous versions that I have used. I think that Quicken has the best software for keeping track of personal finances. I would recommend it to everyone whether you are just starting to keep track or an experienced bookkeeper. It is easy to use and has help at every stage.

41484,0,"It is amazing to see the number of complete computer illiterate persons posting reviews on something they know nothing about. I have been a Linux user for 3+ years. In the beginning, even now, I experience difficulties. I was expecting such because that is how you LEARN. If you want to try Linux (SuSe or another distro.), I recommend using a different machine or a different HD. Only use the same HD if you know & understand what you are doing. As for goobers that say you should have to pay $90 for free software and that this is a rip off. The only thing they have correct is the software is free. You are paying $90 for the SERVICE. You don't get a 800 number or tech support service when you download the software. As for SuSe 9.2, I will found out shortly what I think. In my option 9.0 was better than 9.1, but this is only my opinion. In the end, if you are going to try Linux, do some research and try to get some of the lingo down."
46454,1,"I've used TOPO! for eight years and it's the best there is for mapping software. I own software for 10 of the western states and use the program almost daily. I use the program in my laptop and when hooked up to my GPS, I have what amounts to a super detailed car navigation system with a 17"" screen. As new maps become available, you can download them free into your computer as needed and it's a very easy procedure. Also, free upgrades are available on-line and that's an easy procedure too.To make the state series most useable, you need to add Back Roads Explorer, which gives much more detailed up-to-date street and street name information.The only caveates with this program is that you need a relatively fast computer and lots of memory so you can copy the whole program to your hard drive so you don't have to constantly change cd's. Also, expect to take some time to fully get to know this program."
83038,1,"this game is very fun and great because it teaches and is very hard. it depends what level you choose. even though it gets boring when you play it a lot, it still is fun."
13656,1,Easy to install. Some of the reminder items are a little distracting. Updates are very good and timely. I feel secure with this software(computer wise).
10400,1,"As for the person with AOL, Black Ice shouldn't run with AOL. After all, AOL is constantly selling your info. anyway. Only YOU can stop that problem. I have been using Black Ice Defender for over two years now. I think this is the best firewall out there other than using a router to block ports. I have never been hacked and my PC runs 24/7. It is really easy to use and gives detailed info. on the attacks on your computer. The software even describes what the attacker is attempting to do! I highly recommend this software. It will prove to be a highly effective tool in keeping unwanted visitors out."
57166,0,"The game lacks a theme, which given the quality and complexity of some other games available even for Kindergarden, makes it a bit dull. My kids played with it, then never even looked for it again. Some drills are actually hard to figure out, and no obvious resource explains the kid how to do them. It might be worth considering as an alternative to the written drills, if your kid only needs practice, but do not expect to raise math fans with this game."
27488,1,"I usually play nancy drew games with my best friend when I go to her house, but I thought i'd go for it and buy one and try it by myself, with the help of an online website I finished it (I didn't have much patience to look for everything :P) i couldn't stop playing until I solved the mystery, and saved Maya it was definitley addicting, I hope to get more Nancy Drew games in the future, but I think playing the games are more fun playing with your friends than by yourself then you can be scared out of your wits together.:P I reccommend this game to people because the graphics are truly amazing they're 3D!! the game plot and suspects were convincing, and you really feel as if you're really nancy drew, but I gotta say the most depressing part of the game was when we found out Brady's hairline was receding jk.this is the tip for the girl who was getting caught by the police when she was about to see the tape. When you get the tape don't play it, and don't open the door, instead look for a hiding place, in other words look around for a metal closet then after the police leave get the bulb from that metal closet (if you haven't done so) and replace it with the burned out bulb, now you can see the picture when you put the tape in."
1479,2,"For those considering Outlook 2007, beware of my experience: one morning I ran Outlook 2007 to find it would not download email messages at all. (I would get an error about MAPI.) This appears to be due to an automatic office update of the junk mail filter.One of the most important features of an email program is that it doesn't suddenly stop being able to check email (imagine being on a business trip). Automatic improvements to the junk mail filter sounds great, but if that means one morning I wake up to not be able to check email at all, then the medicine is worse than the disease.The new features and changes Outlook 2007 really do not compensate for the lack of reliability. If you have another email program that works, I'd stick with it and not switch to Outlook 2007.On a positive note, I was able to fix the above problem by running repair (reinstall) from the Office 2007 install program, but this took half an hour or so to run."

10489,0,"While I LOVE Freehand (I have been using it and buying all the upgrades/updates/whatever since 1988, when it was owned by Aldus!), I can't recommend it now. Unless they improve their program to appease the complaints all of us have (mainly, that it's evolved into what we hate about all the other programs out there), I'd recommend looking around. I've seen Xara LX twice today; there's also Inkscape (I used it a little while when I was on a PC, and it was pretty good - and was FREE). Also have noticed a couple I haven't checked out - Karbon14 and Skencil 0.6. I'd really recommend looking around before you spend $bigbux$ on a program that's not what it used to be 2-3 versions ago. I'm probably going to see if 8 will work on my OS 10.4.11 - probably not without using it in OS9 (maybe a pretty good solution). Keep looking, or DL a free trial."
43339,1,"It does what it is supposed to to so the 4 stars. I am quite sure that the new features may find themselves useful when I eventually figure everything out but the changes from the version I have been using are so extensive that my productivity suffered greatly. Maybe others have been keeping ""more current"" and won't be bothered by the interface changes but switching from Office Professional 2003 to 2007 is a big learning curve."

Checking into a hotel or restaurant at a Persian city??? Ok, maybe for the retarded. The only good thing about this program is that its on cd. That means that it can fly a lot farther when you realize the mistake you have made."

81735,1,"I am a Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor and again, have beta tested the new version of QuickBooks. Frankly, I have ALL my clients on QuickBooks software and found it to be the best user package for the small business owner.The refinements in all areas including expanded reporting functions, easier and more comprehensive Bank Reconciliations, tracking all Income and Expenses/class, more options for templates etc and more options for backing up data. I love the remote access feature that I can conveniently reach my client's data screen and we can do online training or on-the-spot journal entries.QuickBooks still is NOT easy enough for most users to set up properly, accounting wise...but very easy to use once you have the initial set-up, it is a basic common sense approach. Basic training for everyday use is simple and straightforward.For the Naysayers out there....QuickBooks has basically become the standard for Accounting Software for small business for a REASON>>>because it continually improves the product. Intuit has also several add-on packages to customize YOUR business to your specific needs. This is more than any other comparably packaged price accounting software out there. They even are offering customized forms/products to let you stand out from your competition.""The QuickBooks Guru""www.schiffmgmt.com"

Compliments to the people of Microsoft."
87620,1,"After the magnificence that was Starcraft, few good original RTS games have been released, most simply clones of that game, or the one other original and highly entertaining recent RTS, Commnand &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2. Both these games revolutionized RTS, but all others are bland copies in comparision. Then came Conquest: Frontier Wars (C:FW). This game is GREAT! What makes the game great? More than just having a variety of units, you'll actually USE most of these units. The new sector system is revolutionary! And the supply system brings in a whole new strategic element which must be taken into account.1.Finally, a game where you need to build more than just 2 types of units!! Most RTSs are a simple race to get to the top of the research tree, then begin building the most powerful units before your opponent can build them. Not this game. Your fleets must be varied, or you'll see that wonderful fleet of nothing but Dreadnaughts massacred by a more varied fleet of Lancer Frigates, Battleships, Fleet Carriers, and Dreadnaughts. Keep your fleets varied!2.This is how space battle should be! Not contrained by one map, but each battle can have up to 16 maps playable at the same time. Nothing beats using one fleet to attack one map, just to distract the opponent long enough to use the brunt of your forces on another sector which is your true target. The wormhole and sector system is intuitive and easy to use, and a great addition to the RTS genre.3. In a real war, your unit would not have an infinite amount of bullets to fire. You would have to keep your units in supply, and C:FW manages to bring this reality to war, yet keeps it from being overwhelming. You simply keep your ships in the supply range of supply platforms in systems you own, and they stay in supply. When you begin an attack on a neighboring system, you must have built supply ships that will keep your units supplied until you can get a supply platform built in there. Of course, knowing this, your opponent will attack and destroy these ships first, hoping you run out of supplies. The strategic possibilites are endless! My only qualm about this is sometimes the action must be halted until you can replace supplyships which have been destroyed, or wait until your supply depot is built in order to advance. But this problem is minor, and won't deter you from playing.I just wish all RTSs were this original and this much fun. This is a must buy!"
7240,0,"I bought this game for my little girl. She wanted it because it had Barbie in it. That's how girls are today, they want Barbie everything. Well, I think that Barbie dhould have educational games. I mean, Barbie is a role model all around the world, so I think she needs to teach kids the importance of education. If, parents, your looking for something educational I wouldn't recomend this. However if you want your child to play a fun game with no education then I do recomend this game."
717,1,"I bought this 3 user pack to upgrade the AV software on my 3 computers at home, 2 desktops and 1 laptop (all Windows XP). I found that if I uninstalled the previous version and then installed this version fresh it worked well. In fact my PC ran better than it had with NAV2004.I have no problems with this version and like I said it was better for me than my older version that expired.The 3 pack id the way to go, if you figure out the cost per license it is rather cost effective."
70212,1,"I have been very happy with this product. My 2 sons were at the library when we came across it. I have a 4 1/2 yr old with AUTISM. He was drawn to this program. I didn't think he would be able to work it since he is more severly effected by autism. After 2 hours it was apparent that we were going to have to pull him away from it. I purchased the same program for our home and he loves it. He doesn't have to know how to point and ""click"" the mouse and ""drag"" it. all he has to do is run the mouse over the desired item and it picks it up. This program is very user friendly."
49056,1,"I don't do a whole lot of computer work, mostly just gaming, watching movies and using Microsoft Office, but since getting my new computer that came with Vista, I haven't encountered anything unusual. For what I do, pros are the organization of the windows and how I can preview the program before maximizing the image. I also appreciate the organization of programs and documents when I am working. The only problem I've encountered has been when I've tried to use a program not necessarily compatible with Vista.Most of the issues I've encountered weren't necessarily with Vista, but rather the computer, which was easy enough to solve. It's been said before, but if you're going to upgrade to Vista, do alot of research to see if it's what you need and make sure the programs you have will be compatible."
18610,1,"Great product. Even though I have an old computer, Carrara Studio 3 renders quickly. Steep learning curve but product runs smoothly. Definitely need a good manual. I recommend The Carrara Studio 3 Handbook by De La Flor. The book that comes with the product basically tells you what each feature is, not how to use the features. The objects I have developed came out awesome and easily port to other products like Bryce and Poser. I'm very excited about the UVMapper feature, although I haven't used it yet it's why I bought Carrara 3. I used to work with Carrara 2. 3 runs better. I highly recommend this product and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is lack of good how to manuals. Thank you Clearancenter and Amazon!"
30992,1,I have used Ulead products for 3 years now I love it for editing videos. The one I use the most is Ulead. I have Adobie and others. Ulead works the best for me. Ulead VideoStudio 11 Plus was easy to adapt to after using the earlier versions. I love it.
29693,0,"Over the past few years, we've recorded at least 20 Sony Digital 8 tapes, and I was interested in burning the home movies to DVD. After trying Sonic myDVD, Ulead Video Studio and ConvertXtoDVD, I decided to try Movie Edit Pro 11, especially when my local B___ B___ was running a $20 off special. Sonic myDVD and Ulead VS 7 were all free when I purchased my DVD burner and TV card a couple of years ago. I bought ConvertXtoDVD direct from VSO.Sonic MyDVD and ULead VS are nice products but the picture they deliver is not too good, or the application hanged when encoding the dv-avi file. ConvertXtoDVD has a very, very limited functionality for creating a menu, but it encodes an excellent quality picture on DVD.Since I wanted one tape (60 minutes) per DVD, I would only have one menu item, and a chosen six chapters (every 12 minutes). I also wanted a product that would allow me to have the chapters as my main menu. MEP 11 will do this. However, every time I attempted to create a DVD with MEP, there was all white noise beginning at 4 min 45 seconds into the show. The noise lasted the remainder of the movie. The picture quality was also not too good. This occurred on any avi file I attempted to burn. The noise was also noticeable within the edit screen of MEP before burning. The other products did not have any white noise.I eventually ditched all the other software and am now using ConvertXtoDVD. The menu is not nice, but I get an excellent picture/sound and a fail-safe production."

The trainer doesn't do all of what it is touted to do but close enough. It has proven to be very reliable. After 3 years of hard, daily use I've only had to clean the reader head and lubricate the disk reader position motor and jackscrew. I've dropped it several times on carpet.. didn't affect it at all."

No problem if you have got Roxio's Go Back 3.0 installed. Both of these events have happened to me recently. Rather than spend hours trying to track down the unusual slowness &amp; ghostly hard drive activity on my system I just pointed Go Back to the prior days boot point &amp; let it run while I went to work. When I came home my computer was booted into Windows, running well, &amp; I had a Go Back screen that would allow me to optionally revert forward individual files (I did my Quicken files so that the work/transactions done on the 'slow' day weren't lost).This program will save you hours of headaches...don't be a slave to your computer..when it acts up just GO BACK!"
9798,1,"Mortal Kombat is a movie adapted from a video game but it is different than the rest. It is the only one ever made that does not SUCK. The film begins with Chan fighting and losing his soul to Shang Tsung. Chan is the brother of Liu Kang, whose sole purpose in the film is to travel to Outworld to find Shang Tsung and exact revenge for his brother's death. The other characters include Sonya Blade,(Pete Sampras' wife), whose partner is murdered by Kano. Johnny Cage(Linden Ashby) is a famous movie star and is insulted when the press begin to doubt his ability and do not take him seriously as a martial artist. All three warriors travel to outworld to prevent the earth from a take over. It is obvious that nobody in this movie except Robin Shou(Liu Kang) knows how to fight in real life. Although Linden Ashby cannot fight he sells it very well and actually resembles the real Johnny Cage from the video game. The two best fighting scenes are Liu Kang vs. Sub-Zero and Liu Kang vs. Reptile. This movie is not the greatest, but after seeing the sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat:Annihilation&quot; I must say that I appreciate the little bit of originality that this movie has to offer!"
80565,1,"I bought my macbook for grad school and wanted to get as far away from Microsoft as possible, so It made most sense to buy Iwork 08 pre-installed. After one semester of use, as well as using the page layout portion of Pages, I am extremely happy with my decision. While word has more features, most of which I never used, Pages has the features and tools I need. Where Pages fall short is in its editing tools. Pages lacks a good spell and grammar check. Which could be a good thing because I often rely too much on a spell checker and do not manually check my writing myself. The page layout part of Pages is amazing for its price. While it's not InDesign, for a1/5th the price, its good. From what I've read, many reviewers are annoyed with the import function. Personally I do not find importing to be annoying or burdensome. To import to word or powerpoint, it takes two seconds.I have not worked with numbers, and have limited experience with keynote. But from what I've tried and messed around with in Keynote, I can tell it is a great program.So, overall this office suite is worth the low price and I do not miss Microsoft Office."

I now have the Intel Core2Duo E6600, one of the fastest available, along with 1GB of RAM, and it still hangs, doesn't respond, and is a pain to use. I wish Windows Movie Maker could import HD. It has 90% of the useful features Vegas does, but not all. As I write this review, it is in the background chugging away and unresponsive just because I zoomed out to view the whole project... not converting, not burning, just zoomed out. I'll probably have to kill the process again."

46173,1,"I recently purchased this package, and compared to the other programs I have tried, this one does seem to have the most power for its price range.It is very easy to enhance photos that are a little overexposed, underexposed, or need to have the color saturation tweaked.It did not come with the exact printer template I wanted, but I found a read me file that gave me enough information so I was able to easily open an existing printer template in notepad and modify it to give me the template I wanted.It was also a simple matter to create a slide show in PDF format that I could send to others. They only needed to have the Acrobat reader to view the slide shows.The ability to make panoramas from a series of shots is the best I have seen (compared to 3 other products).This program is definitely a keeper. I have uninstalled all the others that I tried before finding this one."

Garmin advised me that new maps were coming out next month (should be out by the time you're reading this) but these are very current.....at least for Raleigh and NC.I have a Tomtom Rider and tried to get maps for Europe before we left on vacation. After 3 weeks I still did not have my maps so we bought the Garmin Nuvi in Rome. It's awesome! Ordered these North American maps when we got home and got them in two days.

She reached the end of the road after 5 days and what a sense of achievement she had. She did learn quite a bit while playing this game."
584,1,"In an era where tobacco advertising of almost any type is quickly becoming limited or banned, this CD is bound to be controversial.In my mind, however, it's also historic, educational and important.This product documents exactly how the tobacco companies used any and all psychological tactics at their disposal (and a lot of pretty girls) to get people to start and keep smoking.What's really amazing is how tame modern cig ads seem when compared to the older ones. Some even imply that smoking cigs will make you more healthy!Anyway, this CD was very interesting and I highly reccomend it."
69351,1,"I had to buy this because the 2-year limit had been reached on my Money2006 software. That didn't please me, but I decided at Amazon's price, it was probably worth going through the trouble at least one more time with Microsoft. The install was easy, it converted and brought up my old file without hassle, and it works.Like many have said, no really new features that would have caused me to look at this for any reason other than my situation. The ""online update"" feature seems to be faster and more consistent than before. When using Bill Pay, you still can't see how much money you'll have left in an account after doing several automatic debits."
63481,0,"The product seems OK so far, but a quick note of caution if you are a UK customer who is on '.com' instead of '.co.uk' by mistake, and doesn't look closely at the shipping charge. I think this product misses out on free shipping by 1 cent, and as a result I ended up with a shipping charge of $35.98 + $9.15 import duties, which makes this appalling value!Caveat emptor of course, and I should have looked closer, but I'm sure others will make the same mistake and so forewarned is...Of course Amazon / Berlitz could also flag up an ""are you sure"" warning prior to non-US purchases like mine, given the charges incurred. Would be good practice in respect of customer service"
85146,0,"Bought this for my five year old grandson. He initially was enthralled but lost interest fairly quickly. I think part of that was because it was a bit old for him and some of the instructions were a challenge for him to read and understand but part of it was the limitations of the actions. Since it is supposed to simulate ""real"" pet ownership on some level that was sort of OK. By the time we found instructions on how to put the pet away or get it to perform some action focus was gone.I would recommend this for an older child though; a seven or eight year old might have become more engaged with the adopted pet and have and easier time then a five year old and an over fifty did. It has some fun activities to do with the pet(s), great play settings like a beach, snow scape, and haunted castle, and quick response time to changes and commands."
20012,1,"I've been a software developer for 40 years, and I wrote a General Ledger program for the PC 15 years ago. So then, why did I buy QuickBooks? Because I wanted to accept credit card payments, and QuickBooks is a LOT cheaper than one of those dumb credit card terminals. However, QuickBooks was written by the ""be reasonable - do it our way"" school of software development; the program is NOT intuitive (no pun intended), so the learning curve is significant. The program starts out in ""interview mode"" and asks you questions without telling you the impact of your answers. Once you get your company and chart of accounts set up, the program is quite flexible. I found the program's ""Help"" facility one of the best I've seen in PC software.So, after reading all these negative reviews here, I decided to get a copy of Peachtree Accounting 2003 and compare it.1. QuickBooks offers subaccounts (very useful); Peachtree doesn't.2. QuickBooks doesn't require account numbers; Peachtree does. This makes QuickBooks much easier to use, and easier for non-accounting types to learn.3. Working with the Chart of Accounts is much easier in QuickBooks than Peachtree.4. Reports seem easier to set up in QuickBooks than Peachtree, although that could just be my experience.5. Peachtree offers a brief accounting tutorial; QuickBooks doesn't.6. Peachtree installation is easy and straight-forward, but it won't install common files on a Samba-based network drive, and downloaded updates are only stored on the local drive. QuickBooks works fine with Samba-based network drives, and makes a point of putting downloaded updates on a sharable drive.7. Reinstalling QuickBooks after you've updated the program is a pain, as your company data file cannot then be read by the freshly reinstalled QuickBooks. Unfortunately, the only way to re-update the software is to load a company file. So, you've got to load one of the sample files, upgrade, and then load your company file. Confusing and DUMB.I'm not at all impressed with Intuit as a company (especially TurboTax), but this program is significantly better than Peachtree (the only other program out there I know of that can process credit card payments online)."
54638,0,"I purchased Topo US 2008 specifically to do geocaching and do some basic hiking as well. I was well aware going into the purchase that this product wouldn't have a tremendous amount of topographic detail or hiking trail information. I was expecting a fairly accurate road map though.What I discovered over the past couple of months of using the product is that there are some serious deficiencies in a number of areas. The first is that there are many roads that just aren't there, including some fairly major roads that have been in place for more than a decade! Ironically, there are some roads in the map that don't exist in reality. I don't know if they are planned or have been eliminated since they tend to be in developing areas.The second issue, which is less of an issue, is that the roads are somewhat off the mark location wise. If I zoom in on my Garmin 60CSx, I am quite often not on the road. Again, not a major issue but it could be nicer.I have been fortunate in that almost all of my driving and caching has been done near where I live so I have a pretty good idea of the roads in the area. I will be a lot more pressed to follow the map in an area that I don't know well.Frankly, if it wasn't for MapQuest and Google Maps to supplement this product, I would be even more disappointed.All that said, I will say that I am pleased with the extensiveness of the map for the cost. It has been an invaluable tool while geocaching and it will be fairly beneficial when I go out hiking this summer.Even knowing the deficiencies, I would buy it again since it is reasonably priced and it covers so much area."

76847,0,"Used the Italy maps on the mainland and Sardinia for a couple of weeks. It worked fine in most situations, although the GPS Lady had a tendency to make blunders, occasionally big ones.

So you should not rely on it exclusively; but overall it was well worth the expense."

17102,1,"This is an excellent chess tutorial for all ages of kids. It works as a game, a story, and as a chess lesson.The really nice part about it is the order of presentation of the material, it combines how the pieces move with what they can do. A more natural choice would be to separate them (e.g., here's how a bishop moves, then later, here's how a bishop can checkmate), but the combination of the two gives kids a concrete goal, rather than rote memorization.Those reviews that say ""What do these arcade games have to do with chess?"" have not played far enough into the game, because only when you get to the Intelligym, at the end of the path, does the program make the direct connection between the arcade games and chess then.My 4 year old is entranced with it, and is now seeing three move checkmates on the board.My only complaint with the program is that when someone does something incorrect, the criticism can be a bit too blunt, rather than encouraging, but it only makes my son more determined to get it right the next time."

10962,0,"I used this media version of the encyclopedia on a laptop running on XP. This worked OK, but as I did a limited install, the program would carefully read the disc for many features, even after installation.Yet, I was impressed with the range of information. Numerous articles surpassed what was written in wikipedia on the same article topic.I gave this three stars, because I definitely do not recommend this program for anyone using Windows 7 -even the Professional version. Either Microsoft or Britannica need to work out the compatibility bugs. This program does not install on any version of Windows 7.However, I do intend to get a future edition that is clearly programmed for Windows 7 / 64 bit compatibility. If it were not for the compatibility issue, I would give it 5 stars."
76628,0,"I had trouble immediately upon using Microsoft's D.I.S. 9You decide if these will bother you:1) No lossless .jpg rotate. This means you can't straighten out photos you took while holding the camera sideways without recompressing the image and consequently throwing away image data in the process. I find this deeply disturbing, since every other image manager I've used has this feature, even freeware apps.2) No auto-rotate. This means that you can't just use the information your camera puts in the .jpg file to have the software automatically re-orietent pictures taken while the camera was sideways. Ever upload 50 or 100 pictures at once to your computer? If so, you probably won't appreciate having to rotate them one at a time to the proper orientation.3) No thumbnail update. This one takes the cake. If you alter a picture in another image program (perhaps to avoid the two problems above!) then the thumbnail shown will NOT be updated. I called MS about this and the best they told me was to delete the .POD database file. If you have 1000's of pics like I do, you won't appreciate the time wasted to rebuild this large database.So in summary, I'm pretty much living with the image manager I had before I bought D.I.S. 9. Good luck in your decision."
94298,1,"It is just NOT possible to keep up with tax law changes and the intricacies of deductions without some kind of software. I've tried several competing tax softwares and I have definitely settled on TurboTax. Not only does it link seamlessly with Quicken, but it has a lot of extras that are extremely valuable.Even if you have a tax accountant or tax preparer, TurboTax helps you understand your tax situation and organize your paperwork to make the most of the preparer's time (time IS money, after all.) And, since most of us have to manage our own retirement funds, the Premier edition has some incredibly useful tools to forecast tax and investment outcome not only this year, but down the road.If you own rental property or take special deductions, the deluxe version allows you to run a &quot;what-if&quot; to see how robust your deduction is.The premier version has much more help for the investor. Since most of us must manage our 401(k), the Maximizer, Year-to-Year Deduction Manager, and 10-Year Tax Forecaster are quite helpful--especially if you are nearing retirement age in a decade or less. It also helps you reduce the tax impact of your investments with vital information about capital gains and losses.I think this is the best version yet."

30217,1,"I agree with 99% of Luis's review. Yes, it crashes a lot. Yes the tech support is near zero. No online community to share files with. Undersold its own best features even. But...since I discovered the 4.0 version 7 years ago, this amature hobby 3D home builder churned out more than 100 house design on my home pcs, complete with landscaping, custom arched windows, and custom furnitures, odd shape roof etc. Prior to that I have experimented with similar, more popular home building softwares and I do't read manuals. CHD is intuitive and feature packed - way ahead of overhyped Punch and even relatively reliable Broderbund. I never expected too much of a $50 product but not only it's value for money, it was a DIY 3D architect tool way ahead of its time. You get to custom make simple furniture pieces with the included, handy o2C compression technology by Arcon, which alone costs probably 10 times or more in pro architect softwares. There's also a publish to web template that spits out complete html files you can upload to show your house creation online or email to your contractors. The user interface, preview screen and real time drag and drop feel is unbeatable among it peers - EVEN TODAY. I didn't even think twice and bought the 5.0 as soon as it was launched 3 years ago. These harsh reviews and possibly unknown corporate issues didn't help furthur improvement and developement of this potential gem. What a waste. Today I still marvel at some of the CHD features. And since I upgraded to XP recently, I can no longer run this fav program of mine. CHD is doing so well in Germany they have the 6.0 version. I'm now looking into the UK version 3D Home Designer by GSP, supposedly the 5.0 equivalent, which uses the same Arcon ""core engine"" and is XP compatible.Despite its shortcomings, I think CHD 5.0 deserves a 3.5 star. I give a 5-star to offset the effect."

53831,0,"The program is very useful &amp; easy to use. It is only suppose to be a quick overview &amp; not a complete course. What they give you is good; however, I kept coming up with words I wish they had included. It's divided into specialized groups...First words, numbers, food, shopping, time, colors, countries, body. I didn't need countries or body at all. I'm not going to have a conversation with someone &amp; recite all the countries I can say in Brazilian, same goes with parts of my body. Maybe a few body parts could have been included in other sections...but besides &quot;take my hand&quot;, &quot;I'm touched in the head&quot;, or &quot;my ear aches&quot; (you get the idea) I'm not going to be discussing details with anyone. As a first time traveler there I felt I wanted to know many words &amp; phrases that weren't included. Restaurant, What's your name?, My name is..., address, ocean, mountain. Fish was included but beef, pork, and chicken weren't. Numbers only went to 20. I think 30-100 at least would have been useful. I still would recommend this as an easy, helpful beginning. It needs to be supplemented with other information to be better."

If you want to print maps that share two UTM quadrants you will end up with a messy UTM grid. The other problems with printing are scale and resolution. You can print only one page at the time, there is no such thing like select the area that you want to print and the scale and let the software do the page distribution on a given page size. When you want to print a map the software will &quot;suggest&quot; a scale, that scale is really something, no 1:24000, no 1:25000 is more like printing a picture that a map, however you can choose a custom scale and set to 1:24000 but then the printing quality is gone. The font on the printed map borders can not be selected and scale with the map, that means you will end up with a bigger font on a 1:24000 map than on a 1:25000 map."

52179,2,"After using Microsoft Money on PCs for many years, I decided to purchase a Mac. Since Money doesn't come in a Mac version, I decided to give quicken a try. I've been using it for about a month now and I get more discouraged by the day.I have windows close unexpectedly, I'm unable to create certain entries, even when following the manual, and the on-screen help is useless. Performing a search for a topic will bring up a large variety of random help topics, few if any have anything to do with your search entry.Oh, and the entries in the manual sometimes do not actually reflect the steps you must take to complete an action. For example, if you are directed to select an option from a toolbar drop-down screen, that option might not actually be located there, but exists on another toolbar.Web help is no better than on-screen help. And customer support is structured to make sure that it is not used. If you can't find what you need by searching the support database, you can either use the online support chat feature that is only available W-F, 7AM to 4 PM PST, or pay by the minute for phone support. By the way, don't try using chat unless you have a lot of time to kill because you might never actually get connected to a customer support person. The option to e-mail a support engineer is not available.Planning tools in Quicken are inferior to MS Money. You don't have near as many options to categorize your expenses, and I'll be damned if I can figure out how Quicken will help me come tax time. It doesn't even let you configure your paycheck deductions as pre-tax and after-tax.I think I'm going to sell my Mac and buy a PC so I can use MS Money again. Too bad Quicken isn't working out."

It will upload all waypoints, and routes. It will download all waypoints, routes and tracks! The maps are gorgeous! The interactive web feature is cool but young. It has a geocaching feature. The 3d maps are sweet! It downloads updates and new map layers almost perfectly (had to manually download the software update). I only wish that waypoints symbols would transfer to and from my unit but I can easily live without them.

28679,0,"I purchased IntroDV in October 2000 because at the time it was the only consumer grade digital video solution that worked under Windows 2000. Amazon does not indicated that, but Digital Origin's web site does. After much pain and suffering it is actually working on Windows 2000 and I'm quite happy with it. The installation was unreasonably difficult.The first problem was that Amazon sent me a 1.0 CD whereas only version 1.1, released in May 2000, works with Win2k. Selling an old version months after the new one is released is not very nice. Digital Origin's web site contains an updater from 1.0 to 1.1, so I figured that updating would not be a problem. Wrong. It seems that the updater only works after you have installed 1.0 and 1.0 will not even install under Win2k.I emailed Digital Origin and they sent me a 1.1 CD at no charge. I was then able to install IntroDV, but it didn't work. I emailed Digital Origin again and received no response so I called them. The support person said that he would email me a 40 step procedure that would solve the problem. I followed this procedure several times very carefully and still no luck. The problem was a missing entry point in a dll. I emailed Digital Origin again and they sent back a replacement dll. I deleted the original, which was installed by the IntroDV 1.1 installer, and dropped the new dll in place. That got it working. And about time.I've only made a few movies so far. Mostly I've been experimenting with the different export formats, learning what the tradeoffs are in terms of file size and image quality. I can't comment on the editing features except to say that I've been able to figure out how to do everything I want to do without too much trouble."
12507,0,"I have an older Dell Dimension 4100 Pentium III (800 MHZ) with 128 MB RAM, 30 Gigs, and Windows ME. I decided to try the upgrade as fewer and fewer things are ME compatible, and my computer was still working great. My first try, I lost everything on my hard drive - you can't always restore to what you had, contrary to what the guide tells you. I would say if you are going to do this, first do a fresh install of Windows ME, then install XP before any add on drivers. The second try (with a fresh Windows ME install) went much better. The only problem I had was that when I would go to stand-bye or hybernate, the system ended up having to recover from a serious error. The problem was my video card - a Nvidia Riva TNT 64 (32MB). It is not compatible with Windows XP, and none of the driver updates would help. Other than that, things worked pretty well.I decided to install a different video card. Found a used Winfast Geforce4 TI4200 (64MB) AGP video card on E-Bay for $14 with shipping. I also decided to upgrade my RAM from 128 MB to 384 MB by adding 256 SDRAM ($25 new) in the open slot. I had never even opened a case before, but the installation of each went very well (be sure to use a static strap).Now, I couldn't be happier with my computer, and the XP upgrade! Since XP doesn't require anywhere near as much RAM as Vista to operate(1000 MB minimum rec.), 384 MB is very fast. I'm actually planning on upping to the maximum I can of 512 MB RAM. The system is now very stable - haven't had a single problem since the mods! Surfing with multiple windows open while simultaneously synching my Zune, or listening to music is no problem! I'm figuring that I should be able to get at least another few years out of my computer.I would say if you are thinking about doing the XP add on, first run a check ahead of time to see what compatibility issues you may have (Microsoft has a free on-line check). It CAN be a great way to squeeze a few more years out of an older computer, but there may be some complications which take some time and effort to solve. If you are even slightly mechanically inclined, your older computer is working well, and you don't want to be part of the ""throw away"" society, I would say to go for the upgrade. After the modifications, I'm extremely pleased with the results - they definitely exceeded my expectations! For how I use my computer, it is just as fast as most brand new computers!It is probably a good idea to spend a few extra dollars, and get the stand-alone version, and not the upgrade to decrease the hassle, and likelihood of errors.I gave it three stars because of the initial compatibility problems. After performing the upgrades (now have 512 RAM), I would give it five stars."

58954,1,"First of all, I'm 52 years old, not a kid. My brother - in - law, knowing that I am a life-long, born and raised football fan got me this game for Christmas, thinking I would enjoy it, since they have all the NFL teams, (including my Steelers) plus real named players. I wouldn't have gotten this game myself; but I admit it is much more fun than the 99-cent head caoch football game that I got myself years ago. Agree that the Madden games,etc. would probably be more realistic, but I don't think my PC would have handled it. Any way, I do enjoy the game, and I'll have to get the hang of controlling it; like the others, I get sacked a lot, and seem to have trouble passing.One word of warning. If you are looking for your favorite team players, all you'll get are the team logos and shirts, not the players. Only the players listed on the box are actually in the game. (Licensing, I suppose.) Also some football common sense and savvy is essential, too. Such as use a real quarterback at quarter back. My brother in law played the game himself an had better success than I did, picking and substituting. Like I said I need more practice, and patience reading the rather detailed instruction manual. Be aware of certain rule quirks, like 20-yard first downs, and 5 on 5 play. Sort of takes me back to my youth when we used to play in the alley behind my house. At least they get first downs.Agree, definitely a lot of laughs and good fun. When my 10-month old son gets a little older, I hope he can appreciate this. Also I'll have to teach him all of the other card, board, and casino, sports, and arcade games games I own.NOTE: This is the same brother - in - law that got me the real pool game. Not really being a pool player, though I do shoot occasionally and am not very good at it; that too, is a good game and takes a while to get the hang of. I'm more of a cards and coin-op game person."

89777,1,"Both the hardware and software work as advertised! The audio is connected via the USB and thus, no ""line in"" sound card connection is required. (None of my laptops have a line-in connection). The latest hardware driver was found easily on the internet by the Windows installer. The software installs easily and is intuitive and easy to learn. Everything worked great right out of the box! I am totally confused by the poor rating and glad that I ignored them! I have two other competing video capture products, and the Dazzle combination hardware/software is by far the best that I have used! Highly recommend! (PS- I am NOT an employee of Pinnacle and have no agenda other than to give an honest and fair appraisal of this product!)"
15405,0,"I downloaded the trial version from Arcsoft's website and it worked very well. Lots of neat things to play with and it gave me the ability to really clean up my video when needed. Lots of special effects to use some fun and some adding to the usefulness of the project you are working on. Commands were easy to follow but it did take some digging to find answers in the Help for common tasks. I spent the $100 for the latest version and licence. After installing the program I started working on my first program only to find that I could up load pictures to the program but once I got them there could do nothing with them. After many hours of checking everything out, contacting Arcsoft Customer Service, slow but helpful, it turned out that their latest version of ShowBiz is NOT compatible with Windows Media Edition operating system. The computer would lock up and only rebooting got it going again. Arcsoft then sent me a way to download an old but functional version of the program which does not have all the features available. If you are looking for a program to edit video this program is better than anything roxio puts out. Also Arcsoft's Customer Service Dept. actual responds to your questions. One final point: if you are running Windows Defender you will have to shut it off before using this program or Defender will shut down your Explorer program and shut down the desktop."
21981,1,"This game is so cool! I recieved it for christmas and I have barely ever stopped playing it. One of the funnest parts of the game is that you can design your own custom player and make up names for your own plays. The dances players do after scoring a touchdown are hilarious. This game passes standards that other children's football games do not even try to achieve. If you are looking for a enjoyable, funny, and educational game for your child, this is the one."
6380,1,"I went to see this film, only vaguely aware that it was about a Lesbian family. Mostly I was drawn by the two lead actresses, Benning and Moore, who have long been among my favorites. They did not let me down. Both break new ground with what one other reviewer has call ""pitch perfect"" performances in uncharacteristic roles. Benning's silent, stunned slow burn, as she realizes what has been transpiring between her partner and the Mark Ruffalo character, will surely go down as one of the great moments of cinematic acting.While very entertaining in a first viewing, I have the feeling that this film will repay many more viewings. It comes on as a conventional genre family comedy/drama and proceeds to draw us deeper (not altogether willingly) with each successive scene. Although the ending can be construed as hopeful, it leaves many issues unresolved, more like a comma than a period. It left me with substantial characters who live and grow in my memory. These are flawed human beings who will continue to have to forgive and adjust to the changing configurations of their relationships. It's not 'just a movie"", Alfred. Welcome to the world of grown up relationships in the real world, chronological adults as well as the kids.This film is further evidence of a growing feeling I have had that as far as seriousness treatment of GLBT characters in contemporary setting goes, the ladies are way ahead of the guys. As evidence, I submit ""Saving Face"" and the much underrated ""Imagine You and Me."" ""Brokeback Montain""? Come on, Lee's ""Wedding Banquet"" has already aged way better."
41442,0,"I just left seller feedback, saying what this review will say. It's entirely possible that the seller didn't know that the unit I received was boldly marked NOT FOR SALE. It was new, alright: a WP12 RECOVERY disk. So presumably it won't operate if you don't already have WP12 installed. I happen to legally own several OEM sets of WP12, so this is a handy thing for me, and I'm not returning it. But if you want a genuine WP12 operating disk, better make sure that's what you're getting: contact the seller BEFORE you buy. For technically, had I not already owned WP12 myself, this would have been illegal to purchase.So check with the seller, first. Now, to review WP12. I've used it for years, and prefer it to later WP versions. WordPerfect has some annoying quirks, but so does every other word processor, and I think I've tried most of them. If you do intense word processing -- especially large documents with complex formatting -- then you need this. Microsoft Word just can't cut it. MS Word is far more intuitive for basic functions, and its Print Preview is fabulous. WordPerfect is awful, there. But even MS Word 2010, which I tested in its Trial version, lacked the word processing power needed for long documents (legal documents, novels, books, etc). Maybe someday MS will stop being mediocre. Use MS Word for basic stuff, but get WordPerfect if you frequently write or must edit huge tomes. Or, convert them.This is an older version of WordPerfect, but it runs on the later Windows machines; seems like it would run on Win7, going by what Win 7 says are its 'compatibility' features. So you might need to configure its 'Windows compatibility' settings (search on that term in Windows Help). So you can run it using an earlier version of Windows inside the later one.I've not had to do that, but I use XP 32-bit, which is the latest version of Windows that is backwards-compatible to very old DOS. I mainly run programs written for DOS 3-6 in my XP machines.)WordPerfect can read other files made by even very old DOS or Win3 programs, even all the way back to 20+ years ago. Quattro Pro is not the best spreadsheet (but Excel is even worse); QP is good for translating spreadsheet files. That matters, as Excel has progressively DELETED its backwards-compatibility, even with respect to older versions of Excel.I have no use for the other Wordperfect programs, so won't comment on them.Backwards-compatibility is very important to business owners who've BEEN in business for some decades. We need to make sure our old documents can still be read by the newer machines. After XP, I'm chary of backwards-compatibility. Word 2007 and its companions can no longer read certain older Word documents; and Excel 2007+ can't read wk1 files. So older software you can still run in Windows, is essential. This suite can read those old files. Newer versions of WordPerfect are less able.WordPerfect essentially relies on two windows for its operation: one which is WYSIWYG, and the other, which is 'Reveal Codes', an annoying set of brace-commands which bracket text formatted between each set of braces. It works like a nest, which is a familiar idea to anyone who can write in HTML. That is, the innermost set of braces has a command (i.e., BOLD), then whatever text is OUTSIDE the braces is yet inside another set of braces, so has the formatting of the next set outside. So like concentric circles, the outermost formatting braces, control the whole text, being further refined by whatever added brace-pair commands format subsets of the text within.These codes make the text hard to read. WordPerfect apparently never realized that the user is better served if they made the codes a toggle within the WYSIWYG window. Sigh.Still, the lower Reveal Codes window is better than nothing, even if it runs together, like raw HTML code. You can search the codes, which is helpful; still, you must often type in the Reveal Codes window, to make sure you stay within the right formatting section. As you type, you can see the results in the upper window. I find that very annoying. But the only effective alternative is Word, which gives you NO codes and NO WARNING about formatting, changes formatting with no notice -- because you backspaced, not realizing you wiped out the ENTIRE format of that section -- so you're constantly having to UNDO. And sometimes, the UNDO instead inserts formatting you didn't ask for. Very buggy. Drives me crazy.Next big item: The Table of Contents function in WordPerfect is also annoying, but it works. Just be sure that you set up WordPerfect to NEVER FORMAT based on whatever printer you've got hooked up -- or make sure your printer is off -- if you want a stable document. The most annoying thing about WordPerfect is that it REPAGINATES based on your current printer. The TOC does not automatically update for that. Good thing about Word: it doesn't automatically repaginate. WordPerfect is just the opposite, and you can never really turn off the repagination, unless you keep the printer OFF or disconnected.Next, hyphenation. WordPerfect automatically hyphenates; you must go through hoops to prevent that (i.e., set the hyphenation zone to zero, select 'suspend hyphenation' for EACH document, can't set it as a style default for any document you load). I hate hyphenation. Very inelegant. But I'm stuck with it. Here again, Word offers a better choice. It doesn't hyphenate at all unless you force it to do so.Merging with spreadsheets is an important function which no word processor ever properly explains or handles. Closest one I've found, is no longer sold: Multimate Advantage II for DOS. I use it routinely, in XP (DOS window). However, that software doesn't format well; you have to feed in the printer control codes, as there is no WYSIWYG interface. So I'm trying to use WordPerfect or Word, to upgrade. Usually the results are bad, so I put up with programming my own printer control codes in old Multimate.Spreadsheet merging in WordPerfect 12 is SOMETIMES nicer than in Word. The key is to set the merge data as a separate (ideally top) worksheet in a workbook, with the real spreadsheet containing the data, 'underneath'. The top sheet ONLY contains ALL the data you use for your merge, and no other kind of data. Columns are onewordlong, keep the field names as short as possible, no spaces in the names. The actual cells are addresses to the other worksheet(s) 'underneath', such that the top sheet references each of the variables you need for your merge. For example, if I do 401k participant statements, I need Name, Birth, Hire, Pay, BegBal, Cont, Earns, EndBal, OutsLoan, Vest, and similar columns. One row per record. Each record contains a cell reference, but the display shows the cell results. Excel is great for dates. I use Lotus 1-2-3 for DOS (yep, from the 1980's), and its cells calculate datevalues. Were I to merge with the wk1 file, I don't get date values in Word, but a number string. Excel converts these to the right dates.Then you create the form, and both WP and Word operate in much the same way: you have to use a special key combination to generate the brackets for the field name. The name, is EXACTLY the same as the header row in that Excel spreadsheet. So then Name, not NAME is the field name, to fit the worksheet column title. No blank line between the header row and the first record, but YES a blank line after the last record ends. That blank line is where the word processing will stop. You get an options to specify only certain records, but it's a pain to use. Best instead to just select all records, then omit the ones you don't want, when it comes time to print. For the merged output will be a new document, not a printout.You next specify when to stop reading that record, and go to the NEXT one. WordPerfect and Word each handle the NEXT command differently (Word is easier). It's a complex process, but it works. Very buggy; requires a lot more futzing. Both packages prefer that the merge data file is within the same software. Neither handles outside spreadsheet data merges too well. Usually the user creates a table in WordPerfect (or Word). The WordPerfect table creation method is easiest -- if you can't use the outside spreadsheet method --but the older, clunkier 'field codes' bracketing system (throwback from far older WordPerfect) is still supported:{field code name}Type your data here{field code name}{end record} &lt;-- the second code ends the data field, and 'end record' ends the record. Horrible system. Word is similar. Horrible way to set up a data file.Finally, WP12 can export in pdf format, as can prior versions from 9 forward. That's a necessary workaround, to avoid WordPerfect re-paginating for whatever printer is hooked up to it. I use pdf export often. Thus I can 'print' documents with NO printer attached (which I prefer). Keeps your Table of Contents stable (i.e., for legal documents, novels, etc). You can get the same function in Word prior to 2007, if you buy Smart PDF Creator Pro. It's the best pdf converter I've found; and I use it daily, with my Word 2002 and prior versions. I think it runs about $70. It converts many types of files to pdf, and converts pdf to Word, which you can then edit. WordPerfect can't do this, though it claims it can, for versions from X3 or X4 onward. See my review of X5, here in Amazon, if you want details.So you get the idea: WordPerfect is a complex and powerful word processor. Get it if you find Word frustrating. Expect a huge learning curve and a desire to yell. Above all, first make sure you buying a legal OPERATING copy, from whoever sells it new or used!"
58160,1,"NOTE:I am posting this review on both product pages for this game since Amazon has the same game listed as two different products.After getting stuck on this game for a while, I had put it away to try later. After I tried it again and managed to finish it, this game quickly became one of my favorite Nancy Drew games. ""Stay Tuned for Danger"" may be one of the older games in the Nancy Drew adventure game series, but it is also one of the best.Story-A soap opera star has called you to New York to figure out who is sending death threats to her co star. It soon becomes evident that someone is out to hurt or kill him as the threats elevate and some near fatal accidents occur. It is up to you to figure out who is causing it all.Graphics-Although the graphics are much better than the first game, they still aren't perfect. They are in 3D, and the 3D is done pretty well. The characters are also pretty good, but they tend to freeze in awkward positions as they are done talking, only resuming movement when they start to talk again. But, overall, the graphics are pretty good.Sound-The music in the game is OK, but it really doesn't stand out as being catchy. The background sounds are good in the game, and the voice acting is good, too. Some of the voice actors sound like they were really into their parts while some sounded like they were bored.Gameplay-This game, like all games in the Nancy Drew adventure series, is a first-person point-and-click game. You will move around between 3 main locations while solving puzzles, questioning suspects, and finding clues. The puzzles in this game are very innovative and may require some serious thought to solve them, but although they are a challenge, they are still really fun. In addition to talking to about 6 people in the game, you can also call your friends on the phone to talk over the case from them. You can also ask them for help which is a way to get hints for what to do next.Length-It's a pretty good-sized game. There's a lot to do throughout the game, and it's not necessarily very obvious what to do next. The game should probably last several hours at least.All in all, this is probably one of the most challenging and fun games in the Nancy Drew series. It lasts a while, and it incorporates great adventure gaming elements into the gameplay. I highly recommend it to fans of the Nancy Drew series and adventure gamers everywhere!"

9883,1,"The cast and crew of Mortal Kombat receives my good graces for their valiant efforts to make this movie a resounding success. The plot stays true to the original story of the video game. The characters are the closest to how video game adaptations to the big screen should be. The fights are spectacular, and the music does extremely well to go with the flow of the movie.The movie opens up with a young man fighting the main antagonist, Shang Tsung, on the sacred grounds of the Temple of Light. The man (revealed to be Liu Kang's brother) loses, dies, and has his soul taken away by the sorcerer. Liu Kang wakes up from this dream and sets off to the Temple of Light. Meanwhile, U. S. Special Forces agent Sonya Blade chases after the famed arch-criminal, Kano, at a concert. Then in Hollywood, discredit martial artist/actor Johnny Cage makes another failed attempt at making it big in Hollywood as the best martial artist in the world. Eventually, these three humans unite on Shang Tsung's boat with the elder god, Rayden, to learn about their driving goals with one common purpose: to save the world.The characters are perfected to a 'T.' Liu Kang is a disgraced Order of Light monk who must accept his destiny as the chosen one. Johnny Cage is a failing movie actor who works to prove himself to the world. Sonya Blade is a self-reliant Special Forces agent in pursuit of Kano, the one-eyed criminal. Meanwhile, the cast is supported by a plot that includes a former princess of a lost kingdom (Kitana), a four-armed champion (Goro), and three awesome ninjas with fearsome powers and ferocity: Sub-Zero (freezes things), Scorpion (shoots out a snake from his hand and teleports), and Reptile (Reptilian-like ninja with the power of invisibility).Instead of showing off its display of blood and gore as depicted in the video game, the cast and crew took a chance to develop a morality tale with awesome fight scenes and a plot that would literally blow your mind. Believe me when I say, it's a fight movie like you've never seen before.How would you feel if one day, the world began to rest on your shoulders? If you were the only thing that stood between your world and its destruction, what would you do? This is an extraordinary circumstance that just happened to pick you as the chosen one. Given the purpose of the mission, you could not afford to lose.""The essence of Mortal Kombat is not about death, but life."" No one could have said this better than Christopher Lambert's character, Rayden. His part is done so well as the God of Thunder and the Protector of the Realm of Earth. There is nearly a religious undertone echoing throughout the movie. Even when the Thunder God cannot interfere with the world's problems, he teaches them that man is responsible for their destiny. Their callings, however undesirable, are necessary to combat the everyday evils that surround our world. If no one will take responsibility, who will?This movie receives the highest of accolades in my opinion. I hope the cast and crew continues to produce high-quality action flicks such as Mortal Kombat. It'll blow you away."

Your child will learn mathematical and logical concepts while they are enjoying themselves!The Zoombinis are little creatures who vary in 4 features: hair, eyes, nose and feet. They lived happily until some bad guys came to their village, and now they're trying to make their way to Zoombiniville, a new place where they can be happy again. Along the way they will need to solve puzzles to advance along the path. These puzzles are fun and involve determining which characteristics (hair, nose, eyes and feet) allow certain Zoombinis to cross a bridge, for example. Or you may have to figure out what toppngs need to go on a picky ogre's pizza. These tasks teach problem solving, logic, set theory, sorting, mapping, hypothesis testing and pattern comprehension. The narration is funny and you'll hve a good time playing.I bought this for a 5-year old, and while the tasks are generally too difficult for a preschooler, we play together and some concepts are taking hold. And, I have to admit , sometimes I keep playing on my own!We own over 60 children's software titles, and some we are exceedingly fond of, but if I could keep only one game, this would be it.

15536,0,"The cost of this collection was attractive, so I purchased on the assumption that I couldn't lose. The art itself is of a particular style, but quite usable. As with anything graphic, it really depends upon the individual application.I use clip art mostly in Power Point presentations to enliven what otherwise amounts to a bunch of bullet points. The problem with this set is that the resolution is low, so that by the time you enlarge the graphic to a usable size, it becomes fuzzy and low quality. In their native state, the graphics look great.I have used some of these to supplement my own collection. However, more than any other source, I have used the Microsoft Office collection of clip art and photos, which is almost all high resolution and can be enlarged. It's also free."

As he gets older and understands more he gets different things out of it, both with regard to education and entertainment.

78875,1,"It's a very comprehensive program for everyone, whether you already know French and are just polishing your accent or you are new to the language and don't know a single word! I took French in high shool but have forgotten much of it and used this to re-teach myself what I already knew. It's fun and very comprehensive. My boyfriend is also interested in the language, but he has never learned a word of French in his life! He also found the program easy to understand. The only problem is pronunciation. It can be frustrating because the computer doesn't recognize if you get it ""close enough"". Even when we feel we said it perfect, it won't recognize. It makes the program more time consuming, as we are perfectionists and dot like to advance without a perfect score! But overall I couldn't have asked for a better program. I used to go the cheap route when curious about new languages. And I'll tell you now, Instant Immersion is not worth the money you save. I'm not sure how good Rosetta Stone is, but this was $100+ cheaper and it is better than I could have hoped. I would definitely recommend this product to serious AND casual learners alike!

14337,0,"Seems you either love Quicken or hate it. I'd like to give an unbiased review, if that is possible.If you look at reviews in magazines, they basically recommend quicken or Microsoft money by a nose over the other. I think you have to take this with a grain of salt. I mean, how much advertising money do these two giants pay those mags?I've been using quicken over a decade. It seems each new yearly product offers more bells and whistles, a few design changes, but not too much else as far as useable programming. I liken it to car upgrades. They basically change the shapes and lights, but the bottom line is you just want it to get you back and forth where you need to go.The most noxious thing about quicken is the cost. When you already have a functioning version that does what you want, there's no need to pay 60 bucks just to say you've got the latest version (unless you've got money to burn. If you did, you probably don't need this product!) These companies that give you 20-30% off aren't exactly doing you a favor when you don't have to buy the product at all.Secondly, the lack of support of its previous product used by banks was the ultimate in customer disservice. This essentially forced an upgrade upon its users (myslef included). Customer loyalty be damned!Third, it seems each new version has more glitches, at least according to numerous individual reviews. That's a sign the company is putting more into getting you to buy the product than working on the product to make it better. There is no excuse for this (Symantic, are you listening?)Fourth, there are clearly a few minor things they could do to make the product better. Do they get any customer feedback and try to add it to the next version???? ((Case in point: whenever I download mutual fund data, certain funds get reclassified. Can't they come up with a reliable way to lock features on certain accounts so they can't be changed when you download internet data?))That said, I continue to use quicken, but to get around their mistreatment of their customers, I tend to buy only after the product has been out a while and I can get it at a discount of 60-80%. For instance, I bought 2004 in 2005, and I bought 2006 a month ago. I read the bad reviews and just wanted to see for myself what the problems were. I always save a copy of the previous year's data, since you can't go back without deleting and starting from scratch with an older version. I'm satisfied with the 2006 version, but it doesn't do anything more for me than 2004,2002, or 2001 for that matter.Bottom line, read between the lines of the reviews. A five star, I'd take with a grain of salt. A one-star indicates a faulty disk or a customer dissatified customer, probably for one of the reasons I mentioned above. This is still an above average product, but Intuit certainly doesn't command customer loyalty based on the way they operate."

The reason this product was a match for me is because it makes backing up automatic, one less thing I need to remember to do. I use the easy 'tag' system which automatically adds my most important files to my backup. In my opinion, a great perk.I have recommended this software to my parents (both small business owners) and they both swear by it."

15476,1,"I was waiting for this program to be back in stock, so I recently donwloaded the 90 day evaluation from Sun instead.It converts files created in Word 97 and Word 2000 just fine, as well as PowerPoint (the exception so far is opening a PowerPoint as a read-only file, saving it in StarOffice XML format, modifying, then exporting back to PowerPoint ... some of the graphics lost their colour, perhaps in the zip compression process?). But why use PowerPoint anymore? I can export slideshows to Flash, and then package as an .exe that anyone can view on any Windows system! Plus, the files are much smaller, and the open XML schema should insure file compatability for years.The greatest use for me, is in creating documents that are web- and email-friendly. Instead of bloated .doc, .rtf, or .pps files for download (or sloppy HTML export from Office), I can publish PDF and Flash files that integrate well with web browsers, take up much less space, and improve access to the information being posted (no expensive software required - only free readers that most people already have, and are available on multiple platforms).As for the comment above about no email client, I'd highly suggest Mozilla over Outlook/Internet Explorer any day for small business and personal use (large corporations requiring collaboration would be the exception) ... it is free, stable, and has junk mail filtering built-in among other features. And it keeps getting better with each release."
12710,1,"When I had Windows 98, my computer had a lot of problems. It was always stalling, it was unstable, and practically froze on me 2 times a day over an 8 hour usage. When I installed Windows XP the difference was completely noticeable. I stopped getting the stupid errors on the screen, and my computers functionality and power increased at least by 210%. Windows Xp has its downside though. It still has a compatibility problem with really old programs, (Try Nisus Missle Master 2.5 made back in 1992, for example). But who cares? All I've ever wanted is a computer that can go beyond its limits. Now, with Windows XP, your computer can pass every limit ever made."

47980,1,This program is entertaining and easy to use. The interface is quite intuitive. The lessons flow naturally and are actually pretty fun and sort of addicting. A good indonesian-english dictionary would serve as a useful compliment to this product. It's only weakness is that it contains little on conversation. A listing of common phrases and their usages would be handy. You might also consider purchasing a good phrasebook.
30744,1,"I've barely scratched the surface with Poser 5.I've been using Poser since the first version, and each new release is more full of features than the last. The models and posing abilities of versions 1, 2 and 3 had a variety of flaws, but starting with version 4, Poser has turned into an extremely useful program for anyone who wants to do rendering with the human figure.I gather that some people use Poser to produce final products. I can swear that some of those airline seat information cards use Poser models. I tend to use Poser the way one uses a figure reference guide, to figure out how the bodies are structured, and how perspective works with them.Poser 5 has a nice set of human models, male and female. It also has a few animals. The latest version is so chock full of features that it is hard to figure out where to begin. Let's see. There are the new models, the split screen multi-way posing window, the face and body morphing features, a bigger than ever pose library with full body, hand, face and lip poses. These libraries can save a lot of work.The morphing features let you start with their ""standard"" model and change the body type or facial features by sort of blending the base model with an exagerated model in three dimensions. The lip poses let you do lip synching movies based on phonemes.Two new features I have started exploring include dynamic cloth and dynamic hair. Poser 5 actually solves the differential equations for draping cloth and moving hair. Apparently, you can dump in any 3D model to use as a clothing model. You ""clothify"" it and constrain it with respect to the body where you wish, for example, at the waist. Then you can turn on the air currents and set the figure in motion. Play back the animation, and the clothing swoops and drapes.The hair is similar. You set up hair growth models and the hair interacts with the body, with air currents, with gravity and with itself. The model can run like a pig when you set up a complicated model with cloth and hair going every which way, but in a few minutes, you get something surprisingly similar to real world hair. No more buzz cuts; Rapunzel lives. (I haven't actually tried to model someone climbing up someone else's hair, but I wouldn't be shocked to learn it could be done).I'm a total amateur, and just wanted Poser to move some limbs around, but I've been blown away by the package. For $170, it's a whole lot of software and models for the money.So, why haven't I given Poser a five star rating? Well, it is rather clunky to use. It's hard to do fine adjustments without going to the awkward dial based interface. There are no constraint planes. It takes over your entire screen. You can move the various controls around, but you can't make the window smaller so you can look at a reference picture in iPhoto. Their interferes with the Dock when working with animation.That's enough whining.Poser 5 is a great program, and a real value for the money. I gather they can't make it more Macintosh window system friendly because PC users tend to look at only one window at a time. I'm just grateful that they've done a Macintosh port, and a good one at that."

For instance, i was trying to sync my cousins pocket pc with microsoft active sync, and everything we tried wouldn't work, till we called a dell technician (it was a axim) though we should have called a microsoft techi cause he figured out the problem was microsoft's own firewall!! but otherwise great program!!!"
64454,1,"I started playing this game two months ago and it instanly pulled me in. This was the first Nacny Drew mystery that I played with. Although I don't read the books, the game was defenitly fun. I spent one whole day on the computer and my brother had to drag me away, I was only half way through. You have to look for clues in a mansion and talk to different characters, but you have to choose the right thing to say or they won't tell you anything. You also have to solve puzzles, which got me stuck and I had to spent two hours trying to figure it out. Once I solve the puzzle it was worth it because it provided me with more clues. The graphics are good, I even got lost trying to find my way to the stairs. The music is kind of creepy and if you're not expecting it, it will spook you. All in all this game was fun and I'm going to buy the first two Nacny Drew games. The only problem was that the game was too short and not a lot of characters. Once you finish the game and start again, it will only take you a few hours. But still, this was a fun game. And if you ever get stuck you can go to ... to guide you through the game."

However, setup was a breeze, I love the fact it just blocks those annoying pop ups, scans my emails for spam, and protects my computer. Great program, highly recommend."
37542,1,"First, the bad:I had many of the same installation-related problems that others have noted, so I won't repeat them here. I also want to point out that many of the more robust anti-virus features (e.g. heuristic scanning) are disabled by default, requiring you to manually enable them one at a time. It doesn't even schedule periodic scans of your hard drive - you have to tell it to do so! Quite a chore, and the skimpy manual doesn't provide much help.Now, the good:Fortunately, after a bit of labor and a couple of reboots, the program works very well. It is loaded with features, including anti-virus scanning for my Palm handheld and a built-in internet firewall. I haven't noticed a material slowdown in on-line surfing speed, either, so I'm very pleased with these features. It also has special settings for MS Outlook users, designed to overcome the email program's many security holes. All in all, I think it's definitely worth the small bit of installation-related difficulty to have such powerful anti-virus software on my pc."
74935,1,"As a public school counselor assigned to two different school sites, I needed Office XP on my laptop AND desktop at home. It's been hard to access a computer for confidential letters among the old dinasaur Macs at my sites and, if interupted (a crisis falls in my lap), send the document I'm working on to finish on the desktop at home. So I ordered this, installed it on the laptop, launched, and found out it only works 49 more times before ""activating"" it. But I need it on the desktop too!!!Called a catalog educational software company and was told that there is no license for this product and Microsoft would tell me the same. Have to buy another program at same price they said.WRONG! The program license covers a laptop AND desktop. Call the order desk at Microsoft; someone will explain. Yahoo!!PS: I am dismayed at reports that users were unable to load the program on a second computer. I had no problem at all, just a simple, short conversation with the help desk at the number included with the CD. I guess now that my desktop PC has crashed (beyond repair) and the new one is about to be booted, I'll learn how understanding MS is. Hope I have more luck than some of you! Sorry :-("

There is nil practical reduction (I find nil reduction) in computer speed, as has been suggested in some of the other software review sites, by people, I might add, who apparently have not tried the product. While the product cannot provide complete protection from internet security problems, it will provide an additional layer of protection which is helpful. Recommended."

For example, you still can't edit your ESOP transaction once you enter them. One of the new bug is you can't resize the search results window.Also, Quicken has gone way overboard with advertising. The software in now basically ad-ware, which would be ok if they didn't sell it to you. Finally, the business functions are so cripple they're almost useless.

68887,1,"What I especially appreciated about this program was that no English was used, but it was still easy to follow. For the earliest games I would set it up for my children and pick a game- usually a memory game, and then my non-readers could play successfully.There were several categories of words to choose from, foods, furniture, prepositions, and facial features are some of them.Once you have selected the category, you choose the game, and then the complexity of the game For the basic memory game the screen would show an array of cards with pictures of items in that category (except the facial features and body parts, there you got a blank face with a bank of features such as long black hair, long blonde hair, blue eyes, brown eyes, thin lips, full lips, ears, etc to choose as directed, and the directions were in Spanish).You could just click on the card to hear the item named in Spanish. When ready to play, the computer would name an item (in Spanish), and the player clicks on the correct picture. In this way they see the picture and immediately associate the Spanish word with that picture, making it an immersion language program, or at least, as much so as a computer program could be."
79660,0,"THE GOOD: Decent user interface, logical flow, easy to move around between forms independently of the interview. Installs and e-filing have always worked fine for me.THE BAD: Form 6251 (alternative minimum tax) handling bug. TurboTax fails to include the form in your filing package if you turn out to owe no AMT, but do have one of the tax preference items that requires form 6251 to be prepared (such as private activity bond income - very common for folks who hold municipal bond mutual funds). Plan to receive a letter from the IRS if you are in this situation. Incredibly, the Intuit website blames the IRS for mistakenly sending out letters (I read the 1040 and 6251 instructions and it is very clear that this form is required) and tells you to ignore their request!THE UGLY: Support - forget about it. It's a joke. You have to pay $20 just to talk to someone even if the reason for your call is a bug in their application."

It takes about an hour to learn and beats the learning-curve of Photoshop or anything else; it's not as complicated and has the convenience of step-by-step wizards. Nothing quite like it out there. I also use NetStudio when I do presentations for clients (I'm a freelance designer also), because you can create a website (in front of the client!) in a few minutes. As teacher and user, I recommend!!! And by the way... NetStudio has a very literate support staff (meaning, they talk in full sentences). That's something new in this industry."

While the program works well, it blocks me from my company's remote login website. To keep things secure I need to run a security program on my PC so that the company website can verify that I am legit. Under prior versions of NIS this was not problem. However under this version of NIS, I can not the company website to launch my security program. As far as I understand it, the company web site communicates with the application which is installed on my PC. All this work great under NIS 2006, but in 2007 it came to grinding halt. Norton customer service was not very helpful (understatement -- truth is closer to ZERO help, though they tried).So if you have a situation like me, I would steer clear of the product unless you are very sophisticated or have great PC support at your company.Otherwise works well."

48511,0,"This game is just ok. It takes a little bit of my daughter's(3 and a half years old) time and she plays it when she is bored with her other games. Three of the seven places all you can do is click on an animal and then take a picture of it, those are pretty boring for her which sucks since that is half of the places to go. Then there is one where you steer Dora through a river for about a minute, which frustrates my daughter because of the way its set up and she doesn't play much. Then there is a matching the animals game which she likes there are three pairs of animals to match and find. Then there is a place where Dora stands at the bottom of the screen and you chose an animal to make her do what the animal does to get to the top. Its ok but not super fun. The last one you feed the animal what food it wants by clicking on what Diego says it wants and clicking on the frog. Not super fun but she can play most of the games on her own with little to no help from me and she's only been on a computer for a few days.All in all it took us fifteen minutes to get through it all and it wasn't that great. But like I said my daughter will play it for a bit when she gets bored with her other ones. But she won't play it for long. The other Dora games are much better especially the newer ones."

I bought Pinnacle 10 and was sorely disappointed in that it was supposed to be an improvement over release 8. Not so.I bought Adobe Premier Elements 2.0 and was a little concerned at the outset in that it seems to have a long learning curve. After using it to produce serveral DVDs I have come to the conclusion that, ""old version"" or not, it has by far meet my requirements in ease of use, features, and function. The transitions, video effects, ability to control brightness and contrast in individual clips, title editing, and many other features have made my editing a whole lot easier that with other products. One thing that does take time is the burning process. I use the highest possible quality and pay for it with extended processing.

There are a lot of improvements made since 2000. The new menus can do more functions giving more to do with any project you may need to do. It may not have all the software I had with the 2000 version like FrontPage, Access, and Outlook, but allot of this software is in this version of Microsoft Office. The Getting Started tab offered in each program has help and Tutorials to help teach you how to use everything. I consider this a great investment for anyone; consider this version carefully before going to the more expensive versions to make sure they have something more that you really need.

They'll send you an upgrade to make it work for an additional $10... not exactly the kind of support that warms the heart. The animations on the CDs are well done.

45331,1,"I just purchased a Canon HV10 High definition camcorder from Amazon so I needed a good software program to go with it. I picked the Pinnacle Studio Plus 11 mainly because it was on sale with a rebate and it was one of the major editing software programs that are well known and not programmed by some company I never heard of. This was my very first camcorder and editing software so I can be classified as a beginner.The software took a long time to load and the installation software notified me that my video card (ATI All In Wonder 9000 Pro) did not have the latest drivers. It then halted the program installation on my hard drive. Not a big deal since I loaded the latest drivers and it continued. When I first ran the program I suffered a couple of crashes during start-up and during my first video capture which were annoying.However, after breaking the program in, the program is now running fine. My 2 yr old PC is a 3 GHz P4 630 (non-duo) with 2 GB Mushkin premium RAM on a Asus motherboard. I noticed if you attempt to give a command and then give a second command before the program executes the first command, the program would crash. Annoying but not a fatal flaw since I have learned to be patience with it.On the positives: The program is easy to learn for a beginner and I did not have to read the manual that much. I am happy with the program because it allowed me to cut out sections of my video very precisely and quickly. Adding subtitles, music and special effects were also easy. I shot a video of the birth of my granddaughter and quickly edited the video in about one day just in time to show it to my family at xmas. The rendering and the DVD burn were accomplished without any problems. However, it took a long time to render and burn on a regular DVD.On the negatives: You must be patience with this program. If you have a PC slower than mine with a cheap video card or an integrated video on the motherboard with old drivers, you may have some problems with it. I also wished the rendering was quicker. The program is somewhat bloated with extra features things that I do not need.The bottomline: Buy it when it is on sale and you have a decent PC with a video card from a manufacturer that regularly updates its video drivers. I would not buy it at regular price since it is buggy and bloated. I am satisfied with this program and I am glad I do not need to update my PC to edit high definition videos. I do not have a blu-ray or HD DVD DVD burner so I could not determine how reliable these features are."
78510,1,"PageMaker is the best application I've ever used and remains so. Even though this is the ""old"" version, it outshines and outperforms everything else I am familiar with. I like it because I can place everything exactly where I want it and that precision for alignment, whether text or graphics makes the difference between a professional publication and one that looks like ""cut and paste"". It's a huge application but well worth the time one would spend to learn how to use it. My advice ... take it a little at a time to learn the basics, then delve into other things as you need to know or use them."
29910,1,"I really was wanting this item but hesitated over the price. Doublechecking with Amazon, I found just what I wanted/needed at less than half the cost. Don't always save this much, but have learned to trust any items I get from them. It arrived, installed and I am definitely quite pleased."
46965,1,"This is my first monitor calibrator, so I'm comparing the Huey to not calibrating at all. The calibration really appears to work. For example, when I go to the photo equipment review sites I can now see the difference between all shades of white, gray, and black along the spectrum. Previously, the whites and blacks on either end all looked the same. Also, I can can see much more fine detail in hair, or in shadow detail. I never realized how contrasty my monitor was before calibrating.Two reservations: there's no support for dual monitors. I assume that if you're the kind of person who calibrates your monitor, you're also the kind of person who uses dual monitors. Also, the construction of the Huey seems a little flimsy. That's OK--I don't plan to take it out in the field.Overall I'm happy with the Huey."
17843,1,"The vast majority of Amazon reviews cite the following complaint about this game:- Impossibly frustrating point of view and character control systemEveryone who gives this complaint is using a keyboard and playing single player. The game is awesome! It's reminiscent of a modern day gauntlet -- but IF AND ONLY IF you use 2-3 nice analog controllers and play with other people.I almost skipped it because of the bad reviews; I'm so glad I went with my gut. After picking up two Logitech Dual Action Game Pads, my wife and I have been having a blast.* The puzzles are fun and just challenging enough* The variety of available spells keeps things enjoyably hectic* The music is excellent and really adds to the excitement* The card system for building up the characters adds a depth that keeps us coming back for more.I would have given five stars, but some complaints are legitimate: the perspective is occasionally wonky and the ability to change it would be nice, and more options like resolution or keyboard/controller mappings would have been improved it. But overall it's a fabulous game and with two-three good controllers is absolutely worth it."
22065,2,"First let me say, if you are serious about purchasing PC Study Bible this is good version for the lay bible student. It has enough reference works, good solid reference works, to last a lifetime. If you are not going to delve into Greek and Hebrew, don't waste your money on a more advanced product you'll never need. The Complete Reference Library has just enough Greek and Hebrew resources without overloading you. I've been using PC Study Bible from version 3.0 and have never been unimpressed with its capability. Even if this doesn't have everything you want or need, BibleSoft has extra libraries available for purchase through thier website. If you are interested the BibleSoft website has good literature comparing the differences between libraries and other available products.While the review sounds great, and it was a great piece of software at one time, I can no longer recommend this for anyone. As a PC Study Bible users since version 3.0 I currently consider this software to be ABANDONWARE. While they continue to add books for sale to the library, I would not recommend this product until new development is forthcomming. Though I do not use it, the BibleSoft user community currently recommends Logos (most major operating systems / devices supported, followLogos Bible Software)"
54620,0,"I bought this product knowing 2 things, that it won't work on a MAC and that it should give more detail for the avid backpacker. Most people in Colorado need more detail than the 1:100,000 detail provided by this disk. But when this is all that is offered for your new Garmin GPS, you find a way to make do."
34250,1,"My 4 year old (4 years 2 months) LOVES these games and can do most of them. They are challenging enough that he is learning but simple enough that he can do most of them. Also, there is a GREAT variety so he can learn lots of different pre-k skills, and not get bored. Better still, each ""game"" within this has 3 levels of difficulty, so the game will grow with his skill. The graphics and story line and animation are perfect, just enough to keep his interest and help him through the game, but not so much that you spend all your time watching rather than playing. After a couple of days, he is able to find his way around the game with little help from Mom and can easily spend and hour or more playing at a time. He loves these games!!!"
22483,2,I got this product at a major discount earlier in the year where it sat on one of my shelves until today. Installation was fair enough but as many reviewers say I immediately noticed all of the advertising garbage strewn throughout the program. When it came to setting up my online bank accounts they all errored with error ol-332-a. I can download to the program from my credit card website in the web browser though but doing it from quicken I get ol-332-a (huh?). Then I tried to update the product to revision 5 and I get &quot;A patching engine error occurred.&quot; I downloaded the patches manually and the first patch says the same thing when trying to install it. No KB articles on their website of course. After coming here and reading some of the review it is obvious I should not take any further time attempting to troubleshoot. Garbage.

30669,0,"I bought this title for my 21 month old. He has a few other CD's and has been spending time at the computer for almost 6 months.Jump Start Toddlers is basically a good program - the graphics, sound and content are entertaining and kept my sons attention. However, the program is more geared towards ""watching and learning"" than it is interaction. I would describe Jump Start Toddlers as more of a ""video"" than an interactive game. Most, if not all, of the activities require significant involvement on my part. The ""pointer"" is a small white/yellow feather that is difficult to see at times and you really never know which end of the feather to point at the action you want to click on. In addition, once in the program, I had a hard time figuring out what to do next. All of this means the parent must ""play"" the game while the child watches (for the most part). I would think an older child (3 to 4 years) would get more out of this title.I would highly recommend Reader Rabbit for Baby and Toddler over this title hands down!On a positive note, the program installed in minutes (Windows 2000 Pro), I have had no problems using the program and it is certainly educational."
74518,0,"I'm having some real issues with my recent upgrade to 2005. The primary problem is that I can no longer import QIF's. Unfortunately, I've overwrote my data files with the new version and according to the customer support, I cannot go back to my earlier version. Intuit suggests that I change banks, I suggest that I replace Quicken 2005 with MS Money.The reason for disabling the QIF import was suggested on Intuit's customer-based support was that Intuit charges financial institutions for use of the new format. I guess if you are giving the software away for almost nothing, you have to expect someone to pay for it."

Stability of the system was one of the big reasons I purchased it, but I have had numerous hangups necessitating re boot of the computer.I like many of the graphic features and added ease of use. However, it leaves me with the same sense of disappointment that I have experienced after every windows upgrade."

My sense is that it is a safe upgrade from XP in its current form (only will improve).RDS"

However, after using chem tutor excalibur for one year as supplementary help, it became so much easy for us to keep up with the class. When we solve the problems in chem tutor, explanations for the questions were incredibly fascinating that helped us to grasp the gist of materials. So now, we're getting A's!!!!!!"
80568,1,"This is just simply a great office suite. I no longer use MS or any other office suite because iWork has everything I need. The templates in Pages are great and working with them couldn't be easier. Numbers may not have everything Excel has but it will probably do what you need 90% of the time. Keynote is just flat out fun to work with. While my wife scrapbooks, I create great looking slideshows with animations that outdo PowerPoint. I'm really enjoying iWork. It's put the ""fun"" into an office suite."

85557,0,"But this CD-ROM kept crashing my otherwise-stable machine. Anyone with small children knows that frustration is easily felt by little ones, and I finally had to stop using the game because my 2 year-old was getting too upset when the game crashed. Also, the suggested ages - 1 1/2 to 3 - may be incorrect. Only one game is well suited to little ones (Shapes &amp; Colors) because the child can simply hit any key. The others require more sophisticated motor skills and understanding."
14779,1,"Office XP is a great improvement over version of Office prior to 2000. Smart tags help to bring key features out that once were hidden from view, making it much easier to be productive in Office. Great improvements have been made in Access 2002 which is now much easier to use than its predecessor was, even easy enough that a novice user could figure out how to setup a basic database with little problem. PowerPoint 2002 also features some nice new transitions and other ""bells and whistles"" to help make your presentation look more professional. For those of you who may have created Binder files, in previous versions of Office, this feature is no longer available, however an unbind feature comes with Office XP. The downside that I have heard much about is the dreaded Product Activation. If you work within your license to use Office, you should never have any problems. My computer gets worked pretty hard, and I often have to reinstall Windows. Needless to say, Office has to be reactivated. Never once has MS staff refused to activate my product. This ""torment"" is really more dreaded than most users will ever find it to actually be. Be more productive with a copy of Office XP today!"
74492,2,"I recently switched from Microsoft to Mac and found that this is just about the only financial software written for Mac. I have found it to be very buggy. Some ""features"" don't work and customer support is non-existant. Downloading account information is just about as difficult as setting up online features. I really do not trust this software. Each week I sit with a calculator and double check the figures. Often Quicken has made ""adjustments"" for my accounts and I have to fudge figures to get them correct. Next year I will be going back to Microsoft and one of my first software puchases will be Microsoft Money!"

47676,1,"I have used Visual Page (since 1998) and Front Page and Adobe GoLive and Drumbeat 2000 eCommerce ASP edition for creating websites. I DO like Visual Page for one basic reason. It is quick, it is easy, and it is the simplest of all those tools to learn. It is a good quality wysiwyg editor. It It fantastic at handling Tables. It handles CSS1 (sytles) very well, but it is not good with CSS2 (positioning). For positioning use FrontPage or Adobe. I have had to bring several people at work up to speed with HTML and I always use Visual Page as the teaching tool. It's drawbacks are that it does not have &quot;Publish to a web&quot; functionality like FrontPage. It does not have all the FrontPage server extensions to handle dynamic web pages. It does not do ASP and database access. It can manage a site as a project, but this feature is not very trustworthy in my opinion. FrontPage is better at this. I love it for it's low learning curve and it's very nice way of allowing me to use VP to create the CSS stylesheet code in the head of the document and them i simply type class=&quot;classname&quot; inside of the tag I want it to be applied to. I rate it pretty high for it's low price, ease of use, stability, CSS functionality, and good clean html markup code. Everybody at work is able to pick it up quickly and run with it."

8789,1,"If you are planning, scheduling and controlling projects in accordance with the process laid out by Project Management Institute's Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) then you will appreciate this program's power and features.The features that align to the PMBOK are: easy planning using a work breakdown structure, correct computations for earned value and resource leveling that works properly.Features that I particularly like are: direct import of data into an Excel pivot table (this feature has been in the program since version 1.0, and takes a mouse click to accomplish), wide array of reports, and the ability to switch among Gantt (schedule in bar graph format), organizational view, work breakdown structure view and PERT view, and the ability to export and import between Microsoft Project using the MPX file format. While MS Project is not my tool of choice I have to adapt to what clients are using and it is a common application.How does SureTrak compare to Microsoft Project? It depends on your approach to project management. If you consider Gantt charts to be a project plan and you can get away with it, then stick with MS Project. However, if you begin your planning and estimating with a work breakdown structure, analyze dependencies and find your critical path using an activity diagram, and are managing to deliverables using earned value, then SureTrak is the way to go.Here are a few other facts that commend SureTrak: Primavera is a widely respected brand for high end project management software, such as their P3 product. Nearly every major engineering and construction project on the planet is managed with P3. They also played a key role in defining the earned value project management portion of the PMBOK 2000, which is not an international standard for project management. The makers of MS Project, on the other hand, is known for missed product releases. To me this means that they either do not understand project management or the tools they use to manage their development projects are possibly flawed."

I have a lot of experience with Excel and I only bought the book so that I could prepare for the Excel Expert exam.

I've never had the system lock-up [like Win95 so often] and I never had to restart the computer after changing anything in the Networking properties. This really is a great OS, I'm happy."
61422,1,"I recently loaded the one month demo version of Corel WordPerfect Office X3. The main changes appear to be improved compatibility with other software. In addition, Corel changed the skin to make it look more like XP, added a Yahoo toolbar, and for those who need it, the WordCount feature is on the application bar at the bottom of the WordPerfect window. This new version appears to be very stable. It does a very nice job of importing PDF forms and translating them to editable text.I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect. I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when it had a blue screen, displayed ASCII characters in Courier font (there were no fonts except Courier), and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for wordprocessing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. (It was far superior to the software then available, and remains one of the best.) When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use their power in the industry to take over the wordprocessing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.) I hate Microsoft's stupid animated paperclip -- it makes me feel like a 7 year old. ""It looks like your writing a letter ..."" Go away! It was amusing to watch it roll itself up and spit itself through some imaginary pinch rollers when you print a document. But only once. I want to tell MicroSoft to wrap that annoying the paperclip around their cable modems!! I'm an adult!I have three versions of Word (two purchased and one that came on a used lap-op) and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10, 12 and now X3. I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else needs the document in that format. (I am currently working for a big law firm which uses Word.)In my experience, Word does one thing better than WordPerfect - it works better (although not perfectly) with WEB pages. It would be nice if WordPerfect went to the Web and got the pictures and had the resulting document look like the web page being pasted in. HEAR THAT COREL!?! However, I don't often copy entire web pages into my documents.Don't get me wrong -- the nearly ubiquitous ""Word"" is a fine product and is used by many law offices, particularly the larger ones. I have Office on all three of my computers. I like Outlook and how well Word integrates with it. Word is excellent for short projects like email and correspondence. I just find Word is just not as good as WordPerfect for long documents.The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the format codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed. This is particularly useful when combined with the global search and replace. For example, you can search and replace all [paragraph style] and end up with a manageable document.Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each colum change or page change seems to introduce a whole new set of control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.Another very important feature is the ability to view a document from the ""open document"" screen without having to actually open up the document. This way, if you are searching for a specific document or a document containing certain specific information or ""language"" you need, you don't have to serially open a document, close it, open another document, and so on until you find the one you want. This is particularly powerful when combined with the ""find document"" feature on the ""open document"" screen. Using the find button opens a screen which is similar to the windows ""search"" screen. You can type in a series of words, and WordPerfect will search all files on the hard drive or in the folder/subfolders in which you are working for all documents containing your target search terms. You can then scroll through and look at each document to quickly determine their contents. From the ""find"" screen, you can access the ""quickfinder"" program which pre-scans folders on the computer so that searching for documents is nearly instantaneous. Just tonight I needed to find a ""Declaration re Ex Parte Notice"" to use as a template from amoung thousands of documents. The entire search took perhaps half a minute.The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12/X3 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included and upgraded the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!One of the great advantages of WordPerfect is that the files are much smaller than Word documents. This means you can transport them on floppy drives.As a final thought, Word works very well for short documents such as business letters. If you do anything over several pages, you are much better off with WordPerfect.Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it. I recommend purchasing the stand alone student and teachers version as it contains all of the same programs at a lower cost."
8747,1,This was the only thing that my 3 yr old son wanted for Christmas! He plays with it religiously almost everyday! He loves that he gets to drive the train and interact with other characters from the series as well. It really is a wonderful game and worth the money! Especially for a child who has Thomas on the brain night and day like mine does!! The effects and detail on this game are truly remarkable.
83384,1,"This program is a great way for kids to learn while they play. The treasure hunt aspect is something kids enjoy, and as for the reader's comments about it not being ""Christian,"" perhaps it should be noted that Jump Start is not promoted as a ""Christian"" game. (Maybe Veggie Tales has something along those lines?)As for the ""magic"" aspects, there is magic in everyday life, if one knows where to look. Any game that encourages kids to look for life's magic is well worth it -- much better than the majority of today's video games emphasizing war and killing.From the beginning I have taught my son that peace is where we should put our focus, and for us, *all* is magic. Positive aspects, both in games and in life, are crucial...especially for kids. Jump Start supports that with its ""Way to go!"" attitude, upbeat style and encouragement.If you're looking for a game for your child to practice adding, subtracting, and other academic skills, buy this game. If you prefer something with a Christian slant, there are many sites on the Internet and at your local Christian bookstore that would have something more suited to your taste."

86419,1,"Nikon and NIK Software have given photographers shooting Nikon .NEF format (and all .jpg shooters) a powerful, flexible editing software. While not as complete as Photoshop, it does give .NEF (Nikon's proprietary RAW format) shooters just about everything needed for color adjustment, sharpening, lighting, white balance adjustment, and many other editing solutions. And the use of Capture NX's Control Points gives you much more flexibility making adjustments than with other editing software.A major benefit when editing NEF files using NX is that the files are not degraded when making or saving changes. All details are kept the same as first recorded by the camera.The software is easy to use right out of the box. While reading the enclosed documentation will benefit any user, it's not difficult to use from the start (even this ol' disabled guy had an easy go of it). I originally downloaded the 30-day trial from Nikon's website and was hooked! It didn't take long for the trial to expire for me to order the software through Amazon and I've used it more than any other editing package ever since. I believe that any Nikon shooter, if you try it, will buy it too."

88866,1,"It's true that V the series could be just as corny as many other 80's era adventure shows. I don't deny that. However, V was also a show about heroism, friendship, sacrifice, and freedom. Characters fought, loved, and died. There are people who will point out the changes that happened to the cast over the course of 19 episodes as a flaw, but that's one of the things I liked about V the series. It's definitely not The A Team, Knight Rider, or the Dukes of Hazzard. Beloved characters weren't safe. Popular characters could move on to other areas to continue the fight and popular characters could also die. Sometimes they died suddenly. That's pretty interesting stuff for an 80's adventure show. Even Julie almost tasted death. It's good having this show available again. Thank you WB for putting V the Series on DVD!"
21873,1,"I am using the yearly issued versions of AutoCAD for architectural drawings and architectural precast panel designs.As an experienced user of AutoCAD I've started to design my own house.Being a perfectionist I wanted to see 3D illustrations almost at the start of my hundreds of own versions.My freehand illustrations helped a lot.Just for fun I've bught this program.It was unbelivably easy to learn.The 3D views helped me to throw out my previous &quot;misdesigns&quot;Inspite the limits of working with roofs and decks ( also stairs ), this program already changed my designig habits.I am not even sketching anymore.I start to work right at the beginning ( when I have some new idea, and I have a lot ) with this program.This is my point.With accurate 3D illustrations I can spend a few extra nights with girlfriend and friends.Not to mention my Grandson's compliment: &quot;I am glad your stupid houses are not here anymore&quot; (he ment the tons of sketches)"
68209,1,This game is fun. You can play different styles of the &quot;addicting combination of bingo and slots.&quot; Definitely worth buying!

58181,1,"After complaints from my 11 and 15 year old girls that this game was too hard, I decided to try, Stay Tuned for Danger, to see if I could help them advance. I ended up purchasing the Official Solutions Guide for this game because STFD is extremely difficult, even for an adult! If you are an adult who has lots of spare time to spend on an addictive computer game, then don't hesitate to buy this game! Although the graphics and details are mesmerizing, children around the ages of mine will probably get frustrated and give up if they are left to solve it on their own."

It's only been a month since I've had it and haven't devoted enough time to learning how to efficently maneuver through the program. Has so much to search through...I thought it would be easier to use."

5131,1,"Despite the numerous bad reviews seen here on Amazon.com, I just upgraded from Norton Antivirus 2003 to 2004. I was expecting the worst case scenario: my computer gets bogged down with a memory hog of a program. I have no idea what the bad reviews are for. It runs just fine on my PC, and seems to even run a bit FASTER than last year's version. It makes me wonder what OS and hardware they're running in their PCs.(...)The software works exactly the same as previous versions: it scans for viruses, installs, scans again, and then runs weekly to keep your PC virus free. It also scans incoming/outgoing e-mails as well as incoming files. In this day and age of viruses being in every other e-mail, you really need a product to take care of it for you, so I recommend picking up Norton Antivirus 2004."

I reccomend it for any kid over 8."
90038,1,"I've been using Trend Micro PC-CILLIN antivirus and Internet Security packages for more than 5 years now, and have not had any virus infection problems since I switched from my previous McAfee antivirus program. Very flexible and user-friendly. Depending on your email system, you may need to limit outgoing email scans to files under 1 MB (this is typically an issue based on a Norton or Symantec product running on the email server system). Email scanner works with major email systems and with webmail systems. Flexible manual and scheduled antivirus scans (entire system, selected drives, or selected folders and files). Trend Micro products have worked fine for me on Windows 98, Windows 2000, and Widows XP systems. Includes a good email spam scanner (merely tags email subject line with ""spam""; does not delete from incoming email). Also includes website filters and personal information privacy protection. If you install the firewall component, there is also a wifi intrusion detection component.The only issue is that you absolutely must use the Minimum Installation option if you have another firewall active on your system (I use Zone Alarm Pro). Doing a full installation and then disabling the Trend Micro firewall will not work -- you will get all sorts of system problems (poor or no email and internet connections, problems getting email programs and other antispyware programs to load, system hang-ups, etc.). You need to do a clean install with the minimum installation option. You could, of course, just go with the Trend Micro antivirus+antisypware product for the same results. But I like having a security program CD that includes a firewall component just in case my primary firewall becomes non-functional for some reason."
26129,1,Fireworks 3.0 &amp; Dreamweaver 3.0 are absolutely fabulous. I pre-ordered my copies and could not wait for them to show up. I have been using Fireworks since its 1.0 version and Dreamweaver when its 2.0 version released. The new features in both 3.0 versions are well worth the $$$ to upgrade. Fireworks 3.0 is by far the best web graphics editor on the market. You may also want to check out Macromedia's Flash 4.0 as well. Shockwave websites cannot be beat. Macromedia is producing the best web development software on the market.

I wasn't fond of having to play a game everytime I needed a flashlight. I didn't like all the other games you were forced to play either. Unfortunately I am still chasing the 13 ghosts around in order to get my next clue. I am finding the whole thing monontonous and somewhat frustrating, not fun!"
77374,0,"The product is very good. Although, we felt we had been deceived on the promotion of receiving a $50.00 refund, if you had an old Dragon product (we had a 6.0 model). When actually it had to be a specific Dragon product code and number. We called the Dragon service department and there was no apology, explanation or anything. Just that the specific items were the only one accepted. Amazon.com was very friendly and apologetic about the misunderstanding but couldn't do a lot to help out. I would suggest that in the advertisement of the purchase of this product, that the corporation specifically gives what is accepted up front, not hidden off on another site"
46076,0,Software is fine. I wanted something basic to upload my photos and you can use it for basic items. Seems like you need to read more into the manual for the complicated things you can do with this software. So this software is fair.Don't think of getting a rebate though. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I've dealt with this rebate problem with the same people. I had the previous adobe item that is required for rebate and 6 months later...nothing...
16192,1,"Since I bought this for considerably less than $129, I am quite happy with this product, although it's not perfect. I would have given it 5 stars but for a few things: the designers of the CD ROM software could have made it easier for beginners by not ""hiding"" function buttons, which suddenly appear when the cursor is put in their neighborhood. These icon buttons suddenly show up, and it took me quite awhile to discover that I could return to ""home"" without exiting the program and restarting it (the 'home' button is in the lower left, barely visible unless you put the cursor near it). Once you find and understand all these functions, however, it becomes much easier to use. Also, the program has had a tendency to occasionally crash (I'm using XP on a 64bit AMD processor, 80GB hard drive and 512MB SDRAM) and you'll have to start over. This seems to happen in certain parts of the program more than others, and so far has been only a minor annoyance. Another thing to realize is that each CD ROM has lots of lessons. By hiding the home button, I didn't realize for a time that having gotten through all the activities of the first lesson, there were still many other lessons left on that disc (seems obvious now, but....) And finally, there's quite a bit of spoken (and very funny) ""cartoon"" material hidden away in the ""grammar explanation"" section containing lots of spoken material (connoted by a smiley face icon next to the sections that contain this feature) that you might not even realize is there - so definitely explore every section of each lesson before deciding it's not of interest - you may be surprised at what's hidden away. In fact, now that I've spent a couple days using the first CD ROM, I realize there's really a lot of material to go through. In addition, you get 8 audio CDs which contain the basics of grammar, useful expressions etc, which are spoken by a bilingual woman at a much slower rate than the material on the CD ROMS. The CD ROMS use several native speakers who speak rapidly for the most part. This may be disconcerting at first, especially when you're trying to repeat what they've said, but the software allows you to isolate both sentences and words in a sentence, repeat them over and over, and also has a high tech speech evaluation program if you're computer is equipped with a microphone. This allows you to check your speech by a visible phonogram and computer evaluation. So overall, this is a sophisticated product. I think once you get past the nuts and bolts of finding out how to operate it, you'll be glad you bought it. If I were to make any recommendations about the method employed, I would say that adding substitution drills of the kind used in Foreign Service Institute courses (where a model sentence is introduced, followed by the student being given a prompt to change one aspect of it, such as ""I met her at the bank"" - ""near the stadium - ""I met her near the stadium"" etc - would have made for a truly 5 star product. Substitution drills take the student beyond repetition and require more active involvement in juggling sentence components and aid in fluency, and also allow for old material to be constantly repeated in new contexts. Overall though, this course is quite impressive."
7669,0,Not the greatest. Starts out with some easy lessons and then seems to advance three steps with nothing in between. A few other bugs in the videos make it less than stellar too.
40227,1,"I took 3 yrs in High School and 2 semesters in College and I find this tool to be excellent when it comes to learning and brushing up on Spanish. The audio quality is based on your speakers and sound card installed on your PC not the application. If you are learning for the first time, you should start with the BASIC section and stay there for at least a month. If you try to jump ahead you won't be successful. If your native tongue is not English you'll probably have greater difficulty because this application leans towards English speaker to Spanish. As for the organization the opening screen is Pronunciation, then the Basic Course, Extended Courses, Internet Lessons then Cultural Movies. Where's the confusion. Once you go into the Basic Course, other options are given, including Games which is the only component I felt could using some improvement.This applications works in both Windows 98 SE and Windows XP. Make sure you download and install all the patches for your Operating System...As well as install the latest versions of DirectX free from Microsoft and QuickTime."
14283,1,It serves my needs and is a quality product like the previous editions.
88931,0,"Utility maker, Micromat, has moved from the Mac into the bigger world of Apple hardware with their iPod utility, PodLock. While it's not alone in the arena, PodLock performs a few functions that you'd be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.While PodLock lets you peruse the entire contents of your iPod (including songs, pictures, and recordings), it's main purpose is to provide users with the ability to backup, optimize, and secure data stored on your iPod. The interface resembles a 3G iPod. The pseudo-iPod's screen shows the technical details of any connected iPod while all the program's functions are immediately available through one-touch buttons buttons. While this interface metaphor is simple and familiar, it isn't standard, so some elements don't look very good, particularly drawers.Those drawers are used to display three categories of iPod content - music, pictures, and audio recordings. Each drawer displays a list of the associated files. Details can be displayed on any file and, best of all, music can be played and pictures can be viewed directly off the iPod! That means you can sample music from someone else's iPod.The real power feature of the program, however, is the ability to create an invisible partition on your iPod for storing data if you have at least 500MB free. After determining the size of the partition you can lock access with a password and even use Apple's FileVault encryption to further secure the contents. This provides a comforting alternative to the simpler iPod disk mode option offered in iTunes.But wait, that's not all! PodLock has one more feature to add to your piece of mind. With a single click you can save a backup of all the data on your iPod. That means that after the loss or accidental reformatting of your iPod, an equally simple restore function will bring all of the contents back.As an added bonus, you can use PodLock to analyze and then defrag your iPod's drive, improving access times so you don't have to wait as long for it to load the next song. It seems silly that running a scan and then the defrag is a two-step process, but it's still a nice maintenance feature for an old iPod.Ultimately the big selling point isn't the backup feature since most people back their Mac up on their iPod and not the other way around, but if you want a securable data storage option, PodLock is a must. Otherwise it's worth a look."
15012,1,"I'm an experienced amateur singer. I've taken voice lessons, but I just wasn't satisfied with my ability to sing in tune. This program has already helped me, and I've just begun to explore it. It provides instant feedback, letting you know if you're on the correct pitch. My only complaint is that it does not allow you to edit imported songs in Compose mode, and it does not import perfectly - a few notes did not import at the correct duration, and it doesn't seem to import triplets. But it does so many other things so well, these are minor quibbles.Yes, it uses cartoon characters, but I enjoyed them. If you've got a microphone stand up your rear end and can't imagine singing being fun, maybe this program is not for you."
70383,1,"I read online review and purchased the product. It is absolutely worth every penny. Lessons are easy to understand and remember. I finished four lessons and games one night without feeling bored or tired at all. With the help of it, I've already learned how to play some songs on piano. I will definitely use the product to teach my son the basic music theories."
51612,1,"Studio Ultimate is a very complete video editing package and based on my research the only one which comes with a green screen included. I jumped from version 9 to 11 and had no issues adapting to the new interface and the features. The Movingpicture plug-in works great although the documentation on this is poor. I did buy this for my Sony HDV camera and am impressed that Studio edits HD with such ease. Love the fact that I can go to HD DVD without having to buy an expensive burner or media. Checked the support site and they have an 11.1 beta out which offers the same burning capabilities for AVCHD and blueray players. One note: always check the Pinnacle site for patches and updates! Conclusion, I am very happy with this purchase and haven't had any issues."
37502,1,"I used EndNotes for my doctoral dissertation and realize the many hours I saved by using the EndNote feature of typing in a keyword, then reviewing the list of my references that addressed the keyword topic.With the simplicity of entering data as one writes, there is no hectic searching upon completion of a writing to locate the correct reference for inclusion in the bibliography.Two shortcomings: 1. No spell check, which I understand is now available in the upgrade. 2. Awkwardness in including references read, but not cited in the work."

After that, the software could not detect the SP1 installed and cribbed again with the same problem. I tried installing again with Outlook running - Aha! It worked.The product is a good equivalent of the Franklin covey's paper based planner. And hey, you dont need the paper refills anymore. If you want, you can print your daily tasks and calender to your paper based version also. (I haven't tried it myself though). 'Weekly Planning' feature is the best one where you review your values & mission statement, schedule goals, schedule compass and schedule tasks. Perfect.One thing which I would have appreciated if had been made, is having multilevel hierarchy in the Goals' intermediate steps. And a tighter integration of Goals with Master task list. Though not very intuitive, the 'Coach me' section has the Wizard for creating your initial data. The Wizard is made with Flash, and is very easy to use.Overall, this is a very good tool to get organized and reach your goals. ..."
76370,1,"This is by far the best version in many years. I remember that when I always did my taxes, I often thought that there has to be a better way to find more deductions that they was eligible for. Well my friend, everyone's dream has finally come true in this version. I was a TurboTax Beta tester for this version and I found that there are more detailed videos, help assistance, and even a new navigation screen. I felt much better after testing this version, feeling that I've received all the deductions I could and that I'm getting the most money back from my return. I guarentee you won't be disappointed!!"
69864,1,"I just returned from a trip to the Alps, and this Europe street map card proved an invaluable asset. Essentially, it makes the Nuvi as useful in Europe as it is in the U.S. Aside from some laughably bad pronunciation (which was quite entertaining in its own right), this add-on is spot-on accurate - from big crowded cities to remote alpine roads. Highly recommended."
948,1,"This software makes learning guitar fairly simple. The lessons are good and have a lot of help available if and when you need it. The program installs fine and the only problem I've had with it was that my microphone wouldn't work with it. (But you don't use the mic much so hey, that wasn't too big of a deal.) I was kinda iffy about buying this at first because the reviews that were here on Amazon sounded like plugs written by the company or something. (Who talks like that in real life?) But I did end up buying it, and it delivers what it says. 4 out of 5 stars."
23404,1,"When I was in the market for poker software, I sifted through dozens of online reviews. I considered price, game play, AI of computer opponents and online play. Poker Academy was far and away my first choice, but I also bought EAGLE GAMES Tournament Poker, because I found it for a great price. Although EGTP is good, in my opinion, it doesn't compare to Poker Academy. The AI isn't nearly as strong and there is no online option. The computer opponents in PA are very challenging and the format is great. There are many ongoing statistical categories which break down your playing style and tendencies. The feature that really seperates PA from the rest is the online game play. This alone is well worth the purchase price! You can play both ring games and tournaments for the PA currency, which is called PAX. The great thing about this is that you have to earn every cent of PAX. You aren't given anything to start, so you must either win or place high in games/tournaments to earn it. Games vary from .05/.10 games, up to $50 tournaments. There are roughly anywhere from 40 - 80 members at Poker Academy Online at any given time, so there's always a game to be had. Because PAX is paid out in very realistic amounts (approx. $35 for a tournament win of 10 people,) it really feels like you're playing with real money. This fact causes me to appreciate the ""currency"" much more than I would if I could go to the cashier and instantly grab another $1,000 every 5 minutes. I really can't praise this game enough, and I haven't seen anything else (especially for under $18) that comes anywhere close to Poker Academy V2. Career mode in a future edition would really put PA over the top, but it's terrific as it stands. I highly recommend it."
69436,1,"I love this program, and have logged over (can you believe it) 14 hours of total lesson typing time so far (think about it, that is huge). I will probably double that before I stop using it. I am now typing between 22 words a minute for really hard lessons (lots of punctuation and numbers) to close to 40 for easy words and sentences. I am thrilled. I am nearly 40 years old, and to finally be able to type is really a dream come true. Thanks Mavis.Here is the good and the bad.Mavis goes a little fast in the beginning to learn the keys. You might need to open another user and just start over again to get more drill time before advancing. This is easily done, and no big deal. Anyway, more drill is always good.Once I learned the keys, this is where Mavis really shines. Mavis encourages you with her sweet voice, and I like that. She always varies the lessons, so it stays interesting and challenging They really crammed so many different texts into Mavis, that there is always new material to learn. Riddles, Shakespeare, famous quotes, bizarre difficult word lessons, cute stories, and more. She is almost limitless in this regard. Sure some lessons get repeated, but there is SO MUCH material, I am always amazed that there is more and more new stuff I have yet to type and I have type a solid 14 hours so far. This is a Big Plus.After time, Mavis get addictive, I really look forward to sitting down and typing. It stays fun, and this is key. By getting me to type a lot with it, I keep improving. No other program has as many lessons in it, and will stay as interesting. It is not really the best graphics of all the typing programs, but it really does have the most material to learn from, and done in a way that you slowly keep getting better.I guarantee you this, if you are disciplined and do not look at the keys, and if you regularly sit down and work with Mavis for 10 minutes to an hour a day, you will become a typist for sure. I never though I could learn at my age, thanks Mavis!"
82313,1,"I've been using EazySpeak Spanish for about a week now and find it HIGHLY enjoyable and amusing. I do, however, have to agree with other reviews in that it is not for children. I was a little surprised at the semi-nudity of the characters and how, in one exercise, one bikini-clad female had semi-circles in her chest region to suggest nipples. Also, elsewhere in the program, one is introduced to the Spanish words for beer, rum, brandy, cigarettes, and various types of wine. All of these topics should be off-limits to a 12 year-old, which, the box claims, EazySpeak is suitable for.Overall, the program is fun. However, a parent should know beforehand that there are exercises such as ""Help the Thief,"" which is a numbers game in which you assist a burglar in breaking into a safe. Also, there is an entire exercise dealing with drinks which takes place at a bar. Finally, there are the occasional moments spiced with ""adult humor""... one such moment being a man kissing his wife goodnight while in bed, but fantasizing about a cute female at his job. Again, not child-appropriate, but all of this should be left to the discretion of the buyer."
84906,1,"Any reader of this products review will quickly pick up that Intuit makes hay on expensive, incremental upgrades to its product. That's the bad news. If that really, really bothers you, don't buy Quicken.The good news is that you don't need to upgrade with every annual tweak. You can sit one out from time to time.The even better knews is that Quicken for Mac was a revolutionary product when it came out and continues to be a direction-setter in personal finance software. What it accomplishes is something I couldn't image in my mind's eye during the months and years that a computer-savvy friend of mine begged me to leave my paper ledger behind and catch up with the world.He was right, of course. I've been hooked on Quicken (yes, with it's ridiculously frequent upgrades) ever since.If you can't imagine this either, let me have a go at explaining.Quicken assigns a ledger to each account, pile of cash, piece of property, and any other asset that you own, owe, or would like nobody to know about. It then creates an infinite number of ways to report on what you have, allowing you to plot trends, plan, keep track as specifically or generally of where your net worth is headed, and just about anything else you'd want to do with your personal financial picture.You can also train Quicken to keep up with your accounts electronically. For example, it'll track the value of the stocks you own on line and keep your whole financial picture up to speed with the market's movements and their effect on your wealth or poverty.I am purposely explaining Quicken in the most basic terms possible, because the accumulation of views that lurch negative based on smallish flaws or limitations might well lead you as a potential buyer to overlook just how revolutionary Quicken and products like it are when it comes to keeping track.In sum, it's a superb product with a lousy upgrade plan. But then that keeps Intuit in business. I can hardly resent that."
54550,1,"The TOPO 2008 is a great addition to my GPS. I use my GPS for hiking, the TOPO 2008 is preloaded with quite a few trails. It does not list all of them, but there are plenty to keep me busy. The trail maps are quite accurate. The one downfall is that TOPO does not auto route. If you purchase the CityNavigator, then you can route to different locations. I highly recommend the TOPO program to any hiking enthusiast."

We would also like to thank Sean and the team at Eagle Games for working with us as well. They have graciously agreed to provide the original molds for the trucks, copper and influence markers (`the Boys') as well as helping us with the legal mumbo-jumbo required to make this happen. We will be working with Eagle to allow them to distribute the game to their loyal fans and have been very impressed with the kindness by both Eagle and SDR.

93914,1,"When I had a local computer store install a CD-R drive, it came with the Adaptec CD-RW software. I had problems with the drive from the beginning, and sent it back to the shop. I feel that the system began to crash and I got &quot;Out of Scan Range&quot; messages after the screen went blank. The repair technicians could not fix the problem.A friend told me that the problem was with the software. The &quot;CD Creator&quot; software which was bundled with the Goldstar CD-RW drive was what she called a &quot;stripped-down&quot; piece of software and could not do what I wanted to have it do. The implication was that I would have to buy a &quot;real&quot; piece of software to do make use of the CD burner's capabilities. I decided to do some shopping. In the course of my &quot;shopping&quot;, I read reviews, and I narrowed it down to the Roxio &quot;CD Creator 5 Platinum&quot; and Cakewalk &quot;Pyro&quot;, both of which had mixed reviews. I made my decision in spite of the reviews to go with the Roxio product. I felt like I was casting my fate to the wind, taking the luck of the draw. I am glad I chose the Roxio product.At first, I backed up the old CD-RW software because I was not sure the new software would be any improvement. I was skeptical. I had read some of the negative reviews, and I did not want some of the bad things to happen to me. Maybe I am lucky because I am running only Windows 98, but now I am convinced that I have a good product.I am pleased with the performance of this product. The friend who suggested that I buy new software remarked that it was &quot;idiot proof&quot; so I should have no problems. I think she meant that it had an intuitive interface. You know, &quot;real men don't need instructions&quot; and will try to run software without reading the instruction booklet. Hey, it worked for me. I am basically interested in making copies and archiving my original CDs. Having had casette tapes cooked in my car tape player during a week of temperatures in the 90's, I do not want the same thing to happen with my CDs.I could never do compilations with the old software I had. It would always crash. No problem with that now. I also like the CD labeling software that comes with this software suite. I have not tried to do MP3 compilations. I have heard good reports of what can be done with Roxio's software and MP3's."
19513,1,"Don't mistake this for a ripper of a review, this is one of the best price/performance graphics programs out there (okay GIMP is free so if you get anything out of it its p/p numbers are better, but I much prefer PSP). That said I don't think the jump in features and functionality from 7-8 was as defining to me as the jump from 6-7. I could point to increases in my productivity when I moved to 7 almost immediately, in the jump to 8 things have been less marked. Still, I am glad that I purchased this program and sometimes it is those small touches that make something superior."
89489,1,"Over all I am very happy with the product. It has paid for itself in this short time by just making Happy Birthday cards. I am not totally happy with the product and I am not sure if I would buy it again. The product is well worth the money you are paying but their is a few things which I am not happy about:1. Even though the product gives you CD's which contain Art and Project Models their is more art and projects on the Internet. To access these art and projects you need to go on the Internet which is not a problem. What is a problem is that if you want to get on this site and a lot of other people are on the site already you may not be able to get on the site. If you cannot get on the site you cannot finish your project. You will have to put it away until some other time when you can get on the site. This is frustrating and annoying. It makes you want to take the entire program and through it out the window and buy another brand.2. The other thing I was not happy about was, I was given a coupon, in the box, for a 1 year membership to the ""Million Image Club"" To get into this club you have to fill out some paperwork and submit it on the Internet. After it is reviewed you are then sent a pass word, over the Internet, that allows you to go on the site. Well, I filled out all the paperwork, sent it in over the Internet, as required, but was not sent a password. Well, I tried to find some one to talk to about this but ran into a brick wall after spending a lot of time being directed from one site to another only to end up with no answer to the problem. It seems that Broderbund does not control the product but ""Encore"" does. You will receive almost no help at all from ""Encore"". The only place to get help is from a Forum which couldn't give a reasonable answer on what I should do. So, I am now not getting access to the ""Million Image Club"", to tell you the truth, I don't really care. When you finally can get on the site you have hundreds of images and models to choose from. You really don't need a million more."

94916,1,"I recently made the leap to Macs from Windows and the ominous MS Word. In short, I hate Word. MS must assume that it's customers are idiots, why else do they make Word assume things for you (such as when and how to indent, capitalize words and, number items.) I chose Apple and Appleworks 6.2 b/c it offered me complete control over my documents. I found it to be intuitive and powerful. To find out it's true power, however, you might have to play around with it a little at first, esp. if your are fresh off of Word. But all in all I am very pleased with this very unassuming product. Also, being an Apple user and more specifically an Appleworks user in a Win/Word world the data translator makes it easy to translate docs from AW to Word, even cross-platform. CHEERS APPLE!"

The program is really easy to use but the graphics that come with it are something that you would expect to see in a child's coloring book. You can post your own pics or drawings on the shirts which is a plus. Also I have noticed that black inked words tend to show up gray once you've ironed them on to the shirt with the provided paper. I will try a different brand and see if that paper works beter. All in all it was worth what I paid for. The Hane's website also has some professional heat presses that you can purchase if you get tierd of ironing stuff on by hand."

82478,0,"I just returned from a trip to Europe. For our trip we flew in to Rome, drove to a rural area an hour outside Florence, spent a week there and drove to Florence, then on to Parma, the Loire valley and finally on to Paris. I purchased this software with the Garmin GPSMap 60Cx and offer the following comments.1 - Ignore the picture showing V6 - This REALLY is version 8 for sale.2 - The software was mostly easy to use. The download / upload process was relatively pain free and reasonably fast. There is no need to delete the existing maps in the unit before loading a new map in - your upload simply writes over the current maps.3 - The only bugs I noticed have to do with getting at the underlying directions for Routes you create. I found that selecting the route did not always work, but that clicking on the route on the map and then clicking on Properties to get to the Directions solved the problem.4 - The turn-by-turn directions were mostly spot on. However there were some places in Italy where I ran in to areas that were recently / currently under construction and in these areas, some wrong turns were indicated. The most useful feature in these circumstances was the automatic recalculation for directions.5 - When you zoom in to a quarter mile radius, the location of restaurants, local attractions, etc show up with useful symbols, sometimes with amusing results. Outside the door of our hotel in Florence I turned on the unit and saw no fewer than 15 pizza symbols (pizzerias) within 2 blocks of our hotel.Now on to the cons6 - The Route function does not seem to work as advertised. You are supposed to be able to create a Route between two or more points on your computer and then download them to your device. The only problem is that the Route only works if you also include ALL of the map segments between the points. With a 64 MB limit on my device, this was often impossible. The result is that I had to download subsets of the map segments for my drive from Parma to Paris and then create routes for segments of the drive. If I did not have my laptop with me, I would have been out of luck.A couple of suggestions for version 9. Please break up some of the larger areas into smaller maps. On the segment from Geneva to Paris, I passed through the very northwest corner of one map segment for maybe 15 miles. However I had to load the ENTIRE 6 MB segment in to memory. Alternatively, if the Route function can allow you to load in only the portion of the segment you will drive through, I would be VERY happy.Also, I was shocked to find that the toll through the Mont Blanc tunnel was 39 euros. There were also numerous other tolls along the way from Parma to Paris - totaling over 115 euros. It would be nice to know this in advance to allow for planning purposes. Considering the fact that thousands of pizzerias are pre-loaded, information about toll roads doesn't seem like too much to ask for."

I'm sure the kinks will work out however long it takes."
68720,0,"I have had versions of MS streets and trips since they began years ago. I try to upgrade every year or two. I use it on my desktop and two laptops. When I recently upgraded, I was told that was not a problem. When I received the software, and tried to install it, I would not allow me to install it the third time. I called support and was promised they would find a way and get back to me in an hour. Four hours later, I called again, and was told they could not get back to me and had not found how I could install again. I was referred to a supervisor who again told me he would help and get back to me in an hour or two. That was a week ago. I have made repeated calls and e-mails to this person who never gets back to me. I wish I had gone with there competitors this time around. I can no longer recommend Streets and Trips over the compitition."

Although the warnings can be a bit overwhelming, you can program exactly what you wish or don't wish to allow. You can also choose to click a box that says to allow or deny similar activity if it comes up again. I think it's worth the money, though I don't know how it compares to other products out on the market."

The only limit is your imagination. It even has a spell check feature. This is a great improvement over their earlier version of this software.As a literacy teacher, I have been using this program to develop posters for my classroom and materials for my students. It has certainly made it easy to create visually motivating materials. It is easy to tailor a page to whatever genre you wish to create. They also added a feature so you can save your work as a PDF file. This way you can send what you create to someone who does not have this program and they can view it through ""acrobatic reader"".I really enjoy scrapbooking too and this program makes it easy to develop pages for your digital prints. There are pre-made templates you can use and you can easily modify these or create your own from scratch. It comes with a detailed manual but if you get stuck, their technical support is really available! A lot of companies promise this and don't come through but Nova Development does.For me, this has been a good investment that has been more than worth its purchase price."

73356,0,"This program is pretty good overall, but cannot stand on its own. If you are learning up for a trip to Egypt, Morrocco or whatever, don't even bother because the Arabic there will be a different dialect. Also, the words in the program are not practical phrases that are used everyday, but strange-sounding descriptions like ""the man is on the horse, the woman walks."" Nice to know, but it won't help you find the bus stop.Also, it is crucial to learn how to read (and write) Arabic before tackling this program. If you don't take notes you will be lost in a sea of strange words, and wandering whether the woman said ghain, or khain, or 'ain.From time to time there are mistakes (such as a guy who falls off a cow which is a horse in the pictures), and in the fully voweled version some of the symbols are offset. This could be pardoned, if they didn't charge so much money for their program.If you are in the Army, don't buy this! You can access all the rosetta stone programs for free through https://usarmy.skillport.com/In the end, I would only recomend it to people who already learned some street Arabic over there, and want to standardize their knowledge and widen their vocabulary so that they don't show, say, on a tourist-trip in Algeria speaking business-related Levantine Arabic."

5004,1,Spam was driving me nuts. I tried other antispam software (mostly freeware) and found it not worth the trouble. Norton Antispam filters more than 98% of my spam. Very elegant design--nothing to learn and it couldn't be simpler. This software has made checking my email much less of a chore. I recommend it highly.
64174,1,"I was frantic when I discovered that I had thrown away 20 years worth of accumulated sermons, letters, articles I'd written, even book manuscripts. (Yes, I know I should have backed up! But I hadn't.) I bought this product, and recovered everything. Simple and elegant. It doesn't take a technician to do it. You can also get it on to a start-up CD, which I would think most users would want to do. My only negative is that my e-mails to ProSoft for promised free technical assistance were cryptic and only marginally helpful. But as it turned out, the software was so easy to use that it didn't matter.Several things you should know, however:* The moment you realize you've lost data, you must shut down your computer and restart from the CD or a different drive. Even if you're not actively saving files, applications are constantly writing to the drive in the background, and could overwrite something you've thrown away, making it unrecoverable.* You must have an external firewire or USB drive. It is not sufficient to be connected to a network--DRII will not work over a network. I was able to borrow a small FW drive, and it worked fine.* You will not get back your file names. You will, however, get back file types. So you'll know it's a MS word file, but not which MS word file. Which necessitates opening each file and renaming it. This is the tax (along with the roughly $100 to buy the software, plus all your worry) on your stupidity in throwing away your files in the first place. (Note: I think someone could create a utility to streamline that process.)* You will get back junk you never knew was on there, and that you didn't put there, such as hundreds of foreign language templates and legal disclaimers that Office apparently dumps on to your drive when it first installs, and then erases. (One wonders why it is necessary for Office to do that.)* Finally, if you're using 10.4 and you want to search those unnamed files by content using the powerful Spotllight search engine, you will have to get Spotlight to index the new files. For some reason, that doesn't happen automatically when you place those recovered files back on your disk from a FW drive. Go to the Spotlight preferences panel, click on the privacy tab, and drag the folders with the recovered data into the privacy panel. Close the preferences window, reopen it, and erase them from that privacy listing. As they come back into the main set of files again, Spotlight will automatically index them. Though this happens in the background, it takes a few minutes and slows things down (a small price to pay.)It is cheaper right now to buy DRII on Amazon than on the ProSoft website. If you do buy it at ProSoft, don't bother to get the CD package mailed to you if you have a fast connection. Download it, make your own CD, and save $10."

But the baby is not as obnoxious as A Customer claims. Donald is also wrong because there is a full English translation (click on traduzione).I was disappointed because I want badly a live action movie to learn more vocabulary and grammar. Italian movies with Italian subtitles don't work because (1) the subtitles are never exact and (2) there is the Region 2 problem.Still, I think this comic strip exercise can have some value. But a movie would be better."

62482,0,"Streets and Trips 2001 through 2003 are great products if you like wonderful looking mapped our dead accuracy for a street finders. However Microsoft has made a huge mistake in my opinion with the trip maker portion of the program. They have ripped out all the extremely valuable infomation about Hotels, Exits, Attractions, etc. You can find hotels no problem but it will not give you any information about it, not even a phone number. The biggest downside for me was the Exits. I was planning a 2000 mile trip and I want to know which exits have gas stations. This is ver important because in places like Texas, New Mexico, or Arizona you can go 50 to 100 miles with out seeing a gas station. If the map does not have this info I could get into serious trouble. It does show the exits you just can't get any information about it.I have Microsoft Streets and Trip 2000 and it has all of this information. It does an excellent job with its trip maker. Back then I think it was hands down the best mapping progam you could get for a consumer. But after that version they really messed up. The problem with that version now is that it is getting close to three years old. I do not want to rely on a program that is that old for accuracy.So what is the answer? I found that DeLorme Street Atlas USA 2003 is a very good program. Yes it is slower and the maps are not as pretty (they are pretty nice though). But it has the extremely valuable infomation that MS Streets and Trips took out. This new version of Street Atlas is much, much more accurate than any of the previous version. It is getting close to MS Streets and Trip there too. It also has some extra features that MS Streets and does not have.As for Microsoft, they use to have a superior product but they lost it. There is another company that is giving us what we need. Maybe Microsoft will realize that and fix their product in the next version."

I used the printed drawings to give to the contractors and trades doing the work, and they were thrilled. Once the complete job was finished, you can take the printed version from Home Designer and it is virtually identical to the finished space! That paid for itself many times over!!"

13194,1,"Apparently Norton Ghost and Microsoft's Media Center 2005 give each other indigestion, so I uninstalled Ghost and went looking.What attracted me is that Acronis True Image restores applications as well as psersonal files. I have a 1-year-old HP Media Center 2004. When I have to do a full system recovery, I have to run the HP discs, then download and install several HP patches AND nearly a hundred Windows updates. At this point I install SP2, several more Windows updates and THEN I can install my Media Center 2005 upgrade, and another pile of Windows updates. Now I can start installing about 80GB of applications!That procedure is about 2 days work. A couple of weeks ago I had to do a recovery in order to get back some drivers I had mistakenly deleted. I had an Acronis image on an external hard drive. I asked the program to restore that image. It took about 90 minutes - and everything worked perfectly.I haven't tried the other stuff it will do, just that one recovery. That - all by itself - was worth it!"

I haven't used Partition Magic, but the general response I have read seems to be greater than Partition Commander. Unfortunately, I paid half the price for Partition Commander versus for what I would have paid for Partition Magic. It offers GUI feature, but must be installed under Windows first and run through DOS second. You have to read the manual in order to master the features it offers for disk partition. It has a wizard to help you out, but I would advice people to master manual partition since the wizard does funky partition ratios that it sees fit to optimize your drive. Not a terribly bad problem, but I rather have control over what and where I want my partition."

26219,1,"I have been running Windows XP since 2001 and to tell you the honest truth it has been stable ever since. With the introduction of SP2 in this minor update of Windows XP, Microsoft has decided to make the product ""secure"", than it was thought to be in the beginning. But the past few years have been rough on Microsoft, with consistency in attacks on the product with such vulnerabilities as Trojans, buffer overflows, viruses and the most memorable of the all Blaster (August 2003).Ever since its debut, Windows XP has been causing a lot of headaches and wreaking havoc on corporate networks because of its susceptibility vulnerabilities that were not fixed in its initial release or Service Pack 1. So Microsoft decided to go back to the drawing board and decided to rethink what Windows XP should mean in terms of Security. At first Service Pack 2 was thought out to only be a minor Service Pack update with usual bug fixes, but because of the aforementioned problems Microsoft took new direction and after 1 year of testing we have finally reached a conclusion.SP2 is really apparent, based on my experience of installing the update, users displayed a welcome screen recommending Automatic Updates be turned on (and I would recommend too), after which the user is presented with the Security Center where you can configure the new and improved Firewall settings, such as which programs can access your PC. You also have the option of configuring your Anti-Virus program, unfortunately I have not been able to do so because my Anti-virus is not supported, although it seems (Norton Anti-virus Corporate Edition 7.6). Security Center is really the big change here and should have been implemented from beginning, but better late than never.Other great features which I and many users are undoubtedly thankful for include the Pop-Blocker which should have been included in IE 6 from the beginning (better late than never), its not 100 % percent effective but does a decent job so far of blocking most annoying Pop-Ups. I wish the Windows Team allowed users to train it, so if a Pop does succeed, you can tell the pop-up blocker engine that was a pop-up window and you shouldn't let that pass the next time, maybe Microsoft will let it improve over time. Other great improvements to IE in SP2 is the ability approve programs, so drive by downloads have become a thing of the past, anything you decide to download or accidentally clicked on a webpage has to be approved.Another wish is, better integration of the ActiveX controls with Microsoft's own technologies, I notice that when I had to do a Office Update, the ActiveX API engine on Microsoft's Office website had to be approved before I run the utility that checked for updates for Office products I needed.Microsoft has also streamlined Windows Update to be more user-friendly, you the user have the option for a Express or Custom install, Express only installs the most critical updates, while Custom allows to install the entire kitchen sink, including stuff some users can do without on Windows, (go with Express). Windows XP SP2 includes minor enhancements such as Windows Media Player 9, but why didn't Microsoft just wait a little longer and included Windows Media Player 10, which is already out? The blue tooth update is also a needed update, it wasn't intuitive right out of the box, but is more user friendly, all this, you can get for free if you are existing XP owner.Overall, if you haven't upgraded to Windows XP yet from older versions of Windows, this is the time, but if you are an existing Windows XP user, I say skip this and just order the SP2 CD or download it from the Windows XP Website. I highly recommend users running prior versions of XP especially 95, 98, 98 SE, NT 4 and ME, maybe 2000 also move to XP, since Microsoft is planning on porting any of technologies in XP to those older versions of Windows, plus it has some great new features and you will love the Security technologies that provide a better experience for you the user. Most of all, I highly recommend Windows XP users get this update!"

25817,1,"After reading so many harsh reviews, I was hesitant to purchase product; however, I am very happy. It stops all ads, blocks & traces hacker attempts, & protects my personal informatin that I don't want given out. The key is to BE SURE YOU HAVE NO VIRUS ON YOUR COMPUTER BEFORE INSTALLING IT! You have to read the directions & install it properly. My Norton Antivirus was missing a virus that the Symantec detection kept finding. After many hours, I found & deleted the virus, (without paying for Symantec help & with average computer knowledge). I will defintely be purchasing future upgrades."
16440,1,"I have bought Encarta the last couple years and it just keeps getting better. This version is perfect if you have internet access as it grabs a lot of extra materials online, making the program seem that much bigger, and it can offer so much more material. It is great for reference. I have done many reports with just using Encarta, it has that much to offer. It is also a great learning tool, not just for adults, but for all ages. It has many interactive features that make it a joy to use. Everything is well laid out, and it is easy to find what you are looking for. I have tried most of the other encyclopedia programs on the market, and Encarta is the best by far."
22133,1,"We recentely rented a car for our vacation in Cabo San Lucas and brought our Garmin GPS loaded with the Mexico Street Maps. I am so glad we had this as we most likely would have been constantly lost. The maps were very accurate with regards to the street navagation. The only downfall of the maps was that a signifigant amount of restaurants etc. were missing from the database but I was OK with working around that. The cities are full of narrow, crowded one way streets so just having a funtional GPS to guide us was well worh the cost of the maps. By renting a car we saved several hundred dollars in taxi fare. Round trip taxi fare from the airport to the hotel zone alone was around $150 so you can imagine the Mexico Street Maps more than paid for itsef after a week of driving."

Because of all the features that DO work - and especially because of the TON of free and inexpensive characters and clothing and animals and buildings that exist for Poser.Renderosity.com is a good starting place to hear no-holds-barred discussion of the pros and cons.And crazy programmers (including me), not affiliated with Curious Labs, keep writing add-on utilities to extend Poser, or to work around its limitations.Come join this vibrant community!I personally promise you will be glad you did!-- ToolmakerSteve"
33167,1,"Buy this upgrade!!While not a true switcher (as I run a high end Win XP Pro PC(2.4 ghz dual Intel cpu 2 gig ram...Pro-graphics card and the fantastic Sony GWM-FW900 24"" wide screen monitor) for...a seat 3d CAD/CAM software)But to replace my ageing Dell 800 p-3 mostly used for games and fun with Linux) as a main home computerI bought a top of the line iMac 800 G-4 super drive in March to see what all the fuss was about ref OS-X. as I am an old Unix geek thought it would make a nice BAD Unix toy if this Apple thing did not work out and it was so fine to look at as an industrial design engineer.So if any one was entitled to be miffed with Apple at the full price on this 'point' upgrade it was I.Well this is NO 'point' upgrade! this is like going from Wi 98sp2 to XP pro SP1 only much more so not only Was X 10.1.5 rock solid on the iMac G-4 this 10.2 is faster and better in every way in very subtle waysIf I could get my work software ported to OS-X I would have a dual G4-1.25 Ghz driving my Sony MFW-900 in a momentI am a total convert to the fantastic beauty of this OS and I Have ordered Ashlar Velum Cobalt to see if it can replace my work PC software on a Mac"

She can't seem to get enough about bones. So I checked out a few great books at the library but her interest outlived the month we had the books so I decided to purchase a few. This book had great reviews and I like it, it just is a little too complex and a bit over her head at this age."
48821,2,"With WebEasy7, you get what you pay for. It's an ok program for web design, but it has it flaws. For someone who knows very little about HTML or web design in general, it may be a good way to get a site going. There doesn't appear to be any way to edit the HTML code. There are some features that I was pleased with, such as some of the dynamic HTML effects that allow pictures to fade in and out, etc. but the program in general can be difficult to work with on the other hand. It's far from great but not terrible either."
28948,0,"First a caveat: I am reviewing this program as an inexperienced user, with no particular knowledge of computer graphics programs and a need to create professional-looking business cards efficiently.Although I am unskilled in computer graphics, I am an experienced designer from the dark ages pre-computer, attempting to apply my design skills in this format. In this effort, I purchased what appeared to be the answer to all my design problems. The program offers pre-made designs, a large assortment of fonts and an instruction manual. However, all these elements are packaged and cannot be opened until after purchase, so I could not determine if this program was simple enough to meet my immediate needs. In addition, compared to other, less-expensive, programs, I wasn't sure if this product would deliver for the price. It didn't.After loading the disks provided and navigating the program, I found it to be a little more complicated than what I expected. While there is an assortment of designs, fonts, etc., the instructions are not as simple as indicated, and assume a certain degree of computer literacy. It is my experience that the people who buy these programs need some help, whether with design or layout, in order to create a print-ready document. As well, many of the layouts assume 4-color capability, which looks impressive, but tends to be quite expensive when it comes to printing considerations. The easiest way to navigate, and the one I ultimately used, was to create a design on blank stock, selecting and editing my own typefaces and layout. If there were a degree of difficulty scale for these programs, from 1-5, with 5 the degree of most difficulty, I would have to give this program a 3-4. My intent, in purchasing the program, was to do my design job quickly and simply. I was unable to follow the directions provided without some confusion and had to call the programmers, who were readily available. I also had trouble loading the font I wanted, due to a disk error, and the company immediately sent me a new one. So the support is there and willing to help. I was hoping that I wouldn't need offline support, given the instruction booklet. Most likely, my problems were caused by my inability to comprehend the program language. However, if you are well-versed in compu-speak, this program will be simple to use with a minimum of frustration."
93617,1,"THE METHOD APPLIED TO THIS VERSION OF LANGUAGE LEARNING IS VERSATILE AND EASY TO FOLLOW BY ANYONE. THE INTERFACE HAS CLEAR PROMPTS AND A GREAT SET OF OPTIONS TO CONFIGURE YOUR OWN PACE AND INTENSITY WHILE COMPLETING THE LEARNING PROCESS. ONE IMPORTANT NOTE IS THAT NOT ALL OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH IT. THAT IS TO SAY, FOR XP IT WORKS AT ITS BEST, ALTHOUGH IF YOU ARE A VISTA USER YOU MIGHT FIND SOME FEATURES NON FUNCTIONAL (I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT IN BOTH). NEVERTHELESS, THE PRODUCT IN ITSELF IS GREAT, AND I HOPE THEY CAN SOON BRING A NEW EDITION ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. THE REASON WHY I CHOSE THE SPANISH EDITION WAS BECAUSE IT SAID WINDOWS COMPATIBLE, WHILE THE ENGLISH EDITIONS ARE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC IN THAT RESPECT. NEVERTHELESS SPANISH IS ONE OF THE FIVE LANGUAGES I SPEAK SO I HAD NO FURTHER TROUBLE."

I save money with my attorney since I did most of the work for him.What I also liked, was the sections where I could learn some of the legal mambo-jumbo to help me understand this process."
8637,0,"This is a fantastic product that really walks you through setting up a business plan step-by-step. It calculates things in the background and basically prepares a professional-looking document for you. You'll be surprised what you are able to throw together in just a few days, and it really gives you a sense of accomplishment, which may be lacking in the early days of a startup. The customer service is pretty good. They usually get back to you the same day if you send them an e-mail, though they can be a bit short with you if your question is too obvious to them. They're not long on explanation, though, so if you're looking for a more thorough understanding of the product you won't get it there.The major objection I have to this product, though, is the formatting of the actual plan. Though it's licensed by Microsoft Word, it really doesn't have any of Word's tools, and so there are all kinds of spacing and margin problems that arise for which there is no cure. If you're a regular Word user, you'll expect to be able to do certain things to the text you're working on and believe me, you can't! I'd say about 40% of Word's features are included in BPP. If you export it to Word, you can use Word's tools there, but it doesn't export that well, you can't re-import, and it's basically just a very clunky proccess. So this product is great for setting up your report, but lousy for finishing it. Plan on having to re-format a lot of your plan before actually presenting it to anyone if you care at all about aesthetics and complicated things like page breaks."
41761,1,"This is one of the best computer games that my son has ever played. He can't get enough of it.

70219,1,"My third graders study the Oregon Trail every year and enjoy playing this game. It is educational and exciting! Kids take a small party on a covered wagon trip from Independence, Missouri to Oregon. First, they buy everything they need, from oxen to bullets. They must provide their own food along the way (by hunting, trading, or buying at a fort) and are often faced with illness and even death. If someone does die, you can write their tombstone, and maybe see it on your next trip!This game turns textbook learning into reality. It is hard to make it all the way to Oregon (Hint: it goes faster if you have a lot of oxen). But along the way, you will learn to take care of your party and to appreciate things like good water and good weather. I happily recommend this game to kids age 8-10."

I am now in the middle of my third try and after 2 1/2 hours it is still going. I think it is shameful that Symantec would release this product as compatible with Panther when it clearly is not. The suggestions I have gotten from Symantec tech support have been worthless!"

However, if you are not computer savvy you may have some problems. The thumbnails to view the pictures are installed with the program disk but you have to switch between the 10 DVD's to use the pictures for projects. This is normal with a high quality image collection of this size, however it is still a pain. This can be avoided if you install all 10 disks to your hard drive but you need a whole lot of extra memory to do that. I did that and I am happy. Excellent product if you know how to use it."

48731,2,"Like many of the other reviewers, I was a big fan of Trend Micro's Anti-Virus software.... I found it to be superior to Norton's product in many ways. I upgraded to their Internet Security 2007 and my computer has slowed to a crawl... and if you google ""Trend Micro cpu utilization"" or read the other reviews you will see that I'm in good company.I called their company 800# on Thanksgiving day and they answered with no delay (I guess it's not a big holiday in India...). The tech - Mike - told me that the product is not compatible with internet explorer's latest edition and that a patch would be available in early 2007. He said that if I used Firefox as a browser there would be no problem -- but there still is.I am going to take his final advice -- uninstall the software and return to just the anti-virus product. Too bad -- they had a great brand name until this piece of garbage software. My suspicion is they rushed it out to complete with Microsoft's new Live One Care ... which also offers 3 licenses per package.Caveat emptor!!"
58973,1,"Adobe's After Effects 6.5 (AE6.5) is even better than it's predecessor (AE 5)! Fortunately for designers like me who already use Photoshop and Illustrator, Adobe has done it again and made the integration between these programs even tighter. This closer integration means less time tweaking images either before or after you import them into AE6.5. The time saved here can be better put to use creatively!A new feature of the interface itself is the ability to brighten AE6.5 workspace with new preferences. This is helpful due to the extreme variance between different types of monitors and monitor producers.Additional improvements include new Selection methods. As in most graphics and video programs, the ability to selection exactly what you want is King. With AE6.5, users can now gain more control over their layers and keyframes with these new Selection methods. It saves time without having to select, re-select and turn off or move layers to get at what you need to select.Also, the new Wheel Mouse support is great too. Move around with ease!AE6.5 also adds impressive text and vector paint tools, redesigned and simplified motion tracking, enhanced performance and accessibility. With AE6 you can now edit text directly in the Comp window and Timeline using those tools users are familiar with in Photoshop and Illustrator. Working with the animators and selectors you can easily adjust various properties and behaviors, such as position, tracking, rotation, skew, hue, opacity, and so on. Although AE6.5 is a complex video-editing program, the new advances mean that it takes only a few steps to create some spectacular text effects.The masking features have been improved and now include the creation of automatic masks from alpha channels, better use of keylighting with semitransparent objects and the special Roto-Bezier masking tools.Even better! The Motion tracking tools are even more robust! You can even track multiple points on layers and copy this info to other layers. You can now apply only the horizontal or the vertical coordinates of tracked motion to a target. This is a help in that you can do one or the other, not having to have them stuck together. The controls are more flexible and the performance has definitely been taken to the next level.Another great new feature is the Effects addition ""Liquify"". Many people have used Liquify in Photoshop, but with AE6.5 it is animated. This adds a dramatic dimension to your motion graphics.The color correction has been improved. Adobe has brought over the new Adjust effect from Premiere Pro 1.5 into After Effects. You can now correct or adjust the color, contract, shadows and tones of your footage. Auto Color, Auto Contrast, Auto Levels and other effects have also come from Premiere Pro 1.5.Borrowing from similar tools in Photoshop CS2, AE6.5 now has a new Clone Stamp tool, Eraser tool and a Paint palette. This is another way Adobe is establishing consistency between their products. Interface consistency allows users to go from one of Adobe's programs to another, and still be basically familiar with what the tools do.As usual, Adobe has done their best to make AE6.5 become more friendly to allow users to streamline their workflow when authoring or producing in multiple Adobe applications. Users can move layers and clips with ease between AE6.5 and Premiere. The new Edit Original command allows you to select an item in AE6.5, then with a click, immediately open it's respective tool such as Audition 1.5, Premiere Pro 1.5, Photoshop CS2, Illustrator CS2 and Encore DVD.For me, probably the best thing Adobe did in AE6.5 is to improve the overall performance of rendering and views. I use a 2.0Ghz Athlon 64 with 1GB of RAM. Sometimes in the past, rendering and just getting a preview was almost painful due to the amount of RAM that was being consumed. Now, with the per-item rendering and per-layer image caching, my frame views and compositions are displayed faster. I can also control the quality of the previews in the new Previews preferences panel. By reducing the quality of the preview, AE6.5 renders and displays it faster.Amateur and professional AE6.5 users alike with greatly benefit from the new features and performance of this industry-standard video editing and effect product."

31921,1,"FPlan v8 has some of the best improvements of any version to date. In addition to new options for LightWorks Lighting and Materials the 8.2 update allows for below ground plane basements.It is the only program I know of that allows for the use of imports from it's bundled Designer Cad program. You can use the hundreds of symbols included or make your own and import as 3ds files from Designer (a TurboCad light program).Windows and Doors have unlimited sizing capablilites. UNLIMITED ! Any texture you wish to add can be done within the program. And VRML (virtual reality 'game like' walkthoughs) can be created with touch of a button, with textures included.I've seen the advances in this program for over 4yrs. Any negative comment here are from inexperienced users. In addition IMSI provides a free Forum for users to post questions and examples of thier work.I recommend the product to not only homeowners but remodeling contractors for creating both 3d Renderings and Working Drawings.Their is no product better for the price !!"
5093,1,Overall good way to learn the various aspects of the sorftware.
51164,0,"Pros: Rock solid Debian base, a lot of clever applications, very easy to use, installation is all automatic, comes with excellent documentation, provides great media support and includes Codeweaver (Deluxe version only), Apache and FTP server.Cons: Stripped down version of KDE, root acccount ""disabled"", only available in English, Linspire-style database of free software that you got to pay for. Default destop theme and fonts of debatable taste.I had been waiting for a while to test the new version of Xandros, the Deluxe edition 3 that is. Critics have been raving about it, maybe my expectations were a bit too high but it left me with a bittersweet after taste.Overall, Xandros does a very good job of making this distro as user's friendly as can be. Simple to use but not simplistic. Some menus and commands are cleverly designed. The Xandros File Manager allows you to access all your drives including your Windows partition and Network drives. Any Linux distro can do that. What's clever is to have put all of it under the same folder.The Xandros networks connects you to the Xandros database of software programs, many of them would normally be installed automatically, but can be downloaded sometimes for free, sometimes for a fee. Installation is as easy as can be.Unfortunately what this comes down to is a stripped down version of KDE and the need to access a database instead of installing everything from CD's as other distros would provide you with.The root (super user) account has been ""disabled"". So if you don't know anything about computers you won't mess up with the core of the operating system. But say you just want to move a file (like a language file or codec file) to a program file, you would need to enter complicated unix command line instructions to do it.Another drawbacks overlook by many reviewers is that Xandros is only available in English while many other distros like Mandriva, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora Core, etc can be installed in many languages.If you know very little about computers, are looking for a user's friendly Linux distro with many innovative features, and want to say farewell to spywares, adwares and viruses that plague too many Windows computers, this is for you.But if you just want a basic Linux, easy to use and secure, consider Ubuntu. It is also based on Debian, includes security updates, comes with a beautiful Gnome interface, can be installed in many languages.Linux is not compatible with the vast majority of commercial software so power-users will need to look eslewhere.And did I mention Ubuntu doesn't cost a penny?"
25958,1,Fun Game for all. Software is for mac/pc.The kids like it a lot.
15340,1,It fits. It works. It was priced right. I bought it. What more can I say about it? Still need 2 more words... sheesh...
20947,1,"I purchased this for the low price ($7 at the time of this writing) and for the fact that it has the ability to allow me to add recipes to menus and then make a shopping list from that. The shopping list is really my primary reason for purchasing it.Overall, I'm satisfied. It does what I need it to do with little fuss, despite the lists below. I'm always overly nit-picky, so take what I say with a grain of salt. It's more to let potential buyers know the full story. If I really felt angry about it, I wouldn't rate it with so many stars. IWhat I Like* Categories can be used in place of tags. LOVE THEM!* Easy menu creation.* Easy shopping list creation.* Copying/pasting ingredients (via Import Assistant) is easy, so long as you understand that text MUST be highlighted to work. That's not in the instructions and I can't imagine why either.* If you enter Price information on your groceries, it will give you a price estimate.Annoyances* You cannot customize abbreviations. I prefer my own, thanks.* I don't like the way you cannot add a ""2 T + 1 t"" ingredient amount. On the other hand, my workaround is to use ""7 t"" then under ""preparation"" I put ""(2 T + 1 t). Still, it should allow for that.* Along the same lines you cannot add 2-3 T. You can choose either ""2 T"" or ""3 T"" only. As a workaround for that, and to avoid my shopping list making me short handed, I pick the most amount, just in case. I'd rather have too much than not enough.* Import Assistant does not recognize ""1 (15 oz) can Diced Tomatoes"" and reformats it to ""1 can Diced Tomatoes (15 oz)"". I have to manually change this each and every time, but thankfully I don't use that many cans anymore.* I am not happy with the ""Embed Recipe"" option. As an example, I do not use cream of X soup but instead I make my own. I can embed a recipe as an ""ingredient"" where it will say, ""1 cream of X soup recipe"". Sounds good so far because it will even add all of the cream soup ingredients to the shopping list (very helpful feature). The problem is that if I print the recipe, it ONLY says ""1 cream of X soup recipe"" instead of printing the whole cream soup recipe as well as the recipe it is an ingredient of. I would prefer that it attach the entire text of the embedded recipe.* The Yields should calculate what I need, for me. After all, computers are designed to do the work for us. Let me give an example. If a recipe calls for ""1 c. banana, mashed"" and my Yields say ""1 med banana = 1/3 c. mashed"" then my shopping list should automatically list ""3 med bananas"". I shouldn't have to do this manually, but I unfortunately do. (See Tips below).* It is no longer supported, though for me I could care less. This would be an annoyance for some, so here it is. For me, so long as it works, I'm good. If it doesn't, I only lost $7 and it was worth the gamble.Downright Frustrating* While there is one ""category template"", you must have it set up perfectly the way you want it - the first time you ever create a cookbook - because if you add a cookbook later, they are not applied to all of your cookbooks. All cookbooks must have the new category added manually. This is a serious waste of my time and I cannot fathom why it was done this way to begin with. I think this is probably the number one thing that annoys me most. (See Tips below).* I cannot import my own Yields and my own Price list. I have my own already entered in a spreadsheet on Google Docs and had they provided me a way to import them, I could use them. However I have so many entries that there is NO way I'm going to go through and enter each manually, one-by-one, because this would take months. No kidding. Also, if Yields would actually work on my shopping list, then it would be worth my time... perhaps. Since it doesn't, why bother?* I personally hate Adobe's Acrobat (it's the worst piece of coded software next to Internet Explorer) and it tells you that it won't work if you don't download it, which is absolute nonsense. Users should be able to choose what pdf reader they want to use. I use Foxit Reader and don't appreciate being told I have to download something that I absolutely hate. Besides, it works fine without it altogether.* The same goes for Quicktime. I use VLC and like that one better, thanks. However in this case, the videos are definitely inaccessible unless I use VLC to navigate to the directory and view them manually, provided I can even figure out the file name.Tips on Use* Yields: Because it does not auto-calculate yields, when I enter a recipe like the banana example, I write it, ""3 med bananas, mashed (1 c.)"". Now my shopping list will tell me precisely how many I'll need and if I'm not sure if I made a mistake, I have the measurement there for my reference. Note though that ""(1 c.) will not print on the shopping list. That's strictly a using-it-during-cooking-the-recipe reference item.* Categories: Don't make a lot of cookbooks (I learned the hard way), instead make a lot of categories to include cuisines and flavors. I no longer use the cuisine entry as it is too limiting in my opinion. This makes searching much, MUCH faster. Sample categories are: Camping, Garlicky, Spicy (or Hot), Quick, Easy, Finger Foods, Month (for fruits/vegetables in season - I have each month as a category so I can get them cheaper; an example for Asparagus is April and May), 5 Ingredient, Heirloom (old family recipes), Precious, Dry Mixes, Seasonings and so forth. Instead of Holidays be specific, Christmas, Thanksgiving, July 4th, whatever. You can create and select as many as you want.* Back up everything frequently AND before importing. I've read the reviews of some naive folks here and feel the need to say that if you lose your information, you only have yourself to blame. The #1 computer cardinal rule is to always, always, ALWAYS back up precious files. If you lose it, then don't blame the software. All software and all computers will crash eventually, cease to work or become outdated and no longer usable. Learn it, live by it. MyDrobox is a free option to keep a backup off your computer so you'll never lose it. If you have trouble, backup, do a scan disk and defrag, uninstall, reinstall. If files become corrupted, then that's that. Keep a text backup (you'll have to export manually) of all precious files as well. I make a category (as noted above) for those special recipes.* I have nothing at all to do with this, but try Googling ""Mastercook Pam's Tips"" and download the ""cookbook"" which is loaded with her tips. It's not as outdated as it says it is and is moderately helpful.Again, it is good for its price. It's not the ""king"" as a very old review (over 5 years) claims, but it's a decent piece of software and worth the money."
11475,1,"I absolutely love this CD-Rom. I've always had a problem learning spanish from a book. For one, I had no clue as to how most of the words were pronounced. With this item, you see the word and hear it spoken. The coolest part is you can record yourself saying the words, and it will play it back for you and grade you on how native you sounded. Plus you can have interactive conversations! Also includes talking dictionary, cultural movies, internet lessons, progress checks, and much more. It's worth the money, and better than any other teacher who's tried to force feed this language down my throat. Move at your own pace and have fun learning for a change."
30160,1,"We purchased the 2 cd set for our 22 month old daughter. I can't give a higher review because an error was made in shipping and we only received Playtime for Baby & Toddler.She enjoyed it from the first day, but it took a while for her to understand that the mouse moves the picture on the screen. When it clicked, she was hooked. It is an interactive way to teach a toddler how to use the mouse and she loves playing the games over and over again. She is instantly rewarded with songs and animation.Highly recommended for a first computer experience."
41491,0,"First, you can download SuSE 9.2 off Novell's site (or many others for that matter), so for all intents and purposes, this is free software. I bought it since it comes packaged with lots of other goodies which you can custom install, saving me from hunting and pecking on the internet and piecing it together.But free software comes and a substantial price: TIME. And if you are a Windows guy like me, I hope you have a lot of it, 'cuz you'll need it!I am a Windows Admin, so I do computers for a living. I have no experience whatsoever with Linux or Unix, but I purchased 9.2 Pro to see what the Linux craze is all about, see if I could migrate a few of my home systems to Linux, pick up some experience, maybe even ween myself altogether off Windows since I work with it everyday and break up the monotony. I may be in for more than I bargained for.The Good: The installation is a breeze, and the GUI interface is beautiful to look at. Configuring email and newsgroups is easy, but that's where it ends.The Rest: To really utilize this OS, prepare to read, and read, and read. You may want to join a few Linux newsgroups, give up your social life for a few months if you really want to be good at it. Even advanced features are pretty easy to learn in Windows just by playing around with them for a while, but not with Linux IMHO. If you don't know any Linux commands or don't know quite what to say at a shell prompt, you're gonna be hurtin' for a while.Also, when opening your web browser like Konqueror (KDE), or Mozilla Firefox (which I installed later) - don't expect to be able to navigate to your favorite site and play streaming audio or video like you would on a Windows box with WM or RP. Even though the RealPlayer plugins are installed by default (at least in Konqueror), and SuSE comes with ""Kaffeine"" for playing WM audio, I have yet to get either of these working.Again, I am still unable to pop a CD in the tray and hear music, even after using YaST to get all the latest updates and patches. So prepare to get on the horn with tech support or do a lot of googling on the internet. I have a dual boot system, and all this (and a whole lot more) works fine in WinXP, so I know it's not a hardware issue.To sum it up, if you want to learn how to use this OS or migrate from Windows, you gotta want it REAL BAD. Prepare to do a lot of reading and have a lot of patience."
93799,1,"Hooked on Phonics is essentially a ""decoding"" program. Thus, students who complete the first five level program will have developed basic decoding skills (which is where many students are at the end of first grade). This is the second phase of the HOP reading development program. The HOP Master Reader program improves on the decoding skills via (1) software, (2) reading cards, and (3) four reading books. There are ten separate sections for each level each containing a software phase and reading card phase.Software: The software helps increase a child's vocabulary via syllabic breakdown and word recognition. The first level (Blue level) starts out with mostly two syllables words expanding upon the rules a child learned in the HOP program and making more extensive use of those original rules learned in HOP. The introduction in word complexity increases gradually to words containing five to six syllables by the last (Red) level which is the fourth level. The software helps teach specific rules for various combinations of letters thus increasing analytic breakdown rather than just memorization by sight (i.e. hoping = long 'o' because of only one p vs. hopping = short 'o' because of two p's, etc.) (Note: As an aside, I found there to be several different examples of various rules regarding letter combinations which I was not even aware of.) Some of the sections will have only 20-30 words to be learned, while others have over 200 words. Thus, there is tremendous vocubalary development. This software runs on Vista although HOP will say it isn't Vista compatible. The only problem I found is that it doesn't retain the Child's records (past scoring history) after being closed out.Reading Cards: These follow a successful completion of the software section. These are stories which start out at about 200 - 250 words in the blue level, and finish out at stories being about 400-500 words in length. Most are non-fiction stories regarding sports stars (i.e. Michael Jordan), animal life (dragon lizards), etc. which I found both educational and entertaining.Reading books: A reading book accompanies the completion of each level. Thus, at the end of the first level, the child will be reading an 8 chapter book about a couple of kids who get into a time machine and find themselves back in old British times wondering how they return to their own time. I found my son saying ""Stop, in the name of the King!"" to my daughter and had to laugh.Significance: This will dramatically improve a child's reading comfort level which, by the way is necessary for the third phase of the program ... test prep via the SRA Power Reader program. I highly recommend completing or at least getting deep into the master reader before migrating to the SRA Power Reader because children who don't have great comfort reading will not recall much of what they have read to be able to answer the test questions in the Power Reader cards. Moreover, they will not desire to re-read to figure out the correct answer to multiple choice questions because of a basic lack of reading comfort."
46387,1,"This interactive multimedia childbirth CD is amazing!!! I found everything I needed in it in order to help me go through my delivery with less anxiety and stress. I could sit down, read or look at the video clips on childbirth exercises, feeding and bathing my baby and learning about my mental and physical recovery. This CD was a great help for our childbirth experience and taking care of our newborn, it took me step by step through every stage of the pregnancy and after. I was even able to print birth announcements. The video clips were the best; it was like having a nurse around the clock, very comforting. Highly recommended! A must get for every pregnant women."
21570,1,"For the third year in a row (after I quit Quicken/TurboTax because of the C-Dilla debacle) I've used Taxcut. I don't think much has changed, but I don't care, since it meets my needs inexpensively.It does the familiar Q&A;, walking you through your return, and allows you to skip around in case you're waiting for info to file your final return.I have a pretty complex return...a 10-page Schedule D with many short option sales, and a K-1 from a Canadian oil trust (with foreign taxes and a funky tax shelter reporting form). Taxcut handled the whole shebang last year without a problem (although going through the trades was tedious, even after importing them from MSFT Money). Moreover, I got an amended K-1 on March 30 (thanks a lot!!) and had to file a 1040X amended return...Taxcut handled that with no problems either.This year I did a pro forma return at the end of December to check the consequences of tax-lot selling...Taxcut ate it right up without a hitch, showing me how I could trim over $10K off this year's bill by selling some stock that tanked. Without doing the pro forma, I'd be making many guesses and assumptions on Excel.I gave it 5 stars because it's a great value for the money. If you expect this to perform as well as the Premium editions, with all their bells and whistles and free extras, you'll be disappointed. This is a bare-bones product...you get what you pay for. It is *WELL* worth the bargain price, and a must-buy over its more expensive competitor.I'll be buying the '05 package this December!"
48959,1,"At home, I've been a Mac user since 1991. I also have been something of a Linux fanatic too and have used several distros, mostly Red Hat and now Fedora Core. At work, however I have used MS-DOS, Windows 3.11, 95, 98 and XP. It's fair to say I have never liked Microsoft. But on a laptop I use at work (an older Gateway 400VTX with a 2.2GHz Intel Celeron), I just upgraded to Vista Home Basic. I also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1GB. And despite my years of eschewing Microsoft, guess what? I must say I really like the OS. It runs fine on my slower system and I had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers.I think Microsoft has really made a ""cool"" OS."
57567,1,"I bought this game because I was looking for old games to run on my 2003 XP computer. This one runs like a charm. It's definitely kid friendly but adults are nothing but big kids anyway and I enjoy playing this game. In season mode if you try and gain a few skills you can beat the cpu every time. But you have to try because the cpu does not always throw you strikes, and it does not always make it easy for you in the field. If you think you can just throw whatever and wherever when you're pitching, you might get beat.If you lose your cool on defense because the cpu caused your team to commit errors or threw power ups at you you might also lose. If you don't like the way the game is going, you can quit and start it all over again from scratch. Hopefully, I'll never do that ! The game compiles stats in season mode just like the big boy baseball games. It has announcers and color commentary too and different stadiums and crazy power ups and new players that get unlocked that you can trade up to. Why am I giving this game only 4 stars ? I don't know so there you go now it's 5 stars because there's nothing wrong wth the game. It looks great, it's fun, has simple controls that work (keyboard or mouse not both), and you have to try to beat the cpu so it takes some skills. I'd recommend practicing fielding a good bit because that's the hardest part of the game. The fielding challenge is the best way to do that. Once you get decent at that, you'll most likely be invincible and who doesn't want to be invincible?"
27237,2,"Perhaps because FoxNews owns a piece of Susteen Corp., well, DataPilot, when used to put new address entries into your cell phone, does something very sneaky. It embeds a RESET for each address and tells phone the ringer is the FoxNews ringer! If your phone has internet and no foxnews ringer, each person calling that is in your addr book causes the phone to search fox web site for a ringer. Cust Serv and Tech Supp UNRESPONSIVE after 60 days of trying! You get stuck having to edit EVERY addr entry on phone, resetting ringer to normal and deleting foxnews logo as default image for EVERY entry! ALSO, contrary to their ads, be VERY careful... MOST new phones do NOT allow you to connect to internet via datapilot on laptop. Sprint, Cingular and others now blocking this but DataPilot keeps advertising this capability."
65799,0,"This software has been helpful to me in doing my own Living Trust, Pour Over Will, Living Will, etc. . It is pretty straight forward, yet has been frustrating at times when something that should work isn't. For example, it refuses to fill in my name or my wifes name when i select either of us from a list (in any of its build your document through questions sections), but will fill in everyone else. It does still let you edit the final document to fix this, but i have had to hand edit it."
65194,1,"Trying to pick a Linux distribution can be a bit hard. You can go with the most popular (RedHat) or the most featured (SuSIE) or you can look for one that's best taloried to what you want.At the core, all Linux distrubtions have the same OS kernal (well some may have slightly different versions) and even come with a lot of the same core third-party applications (Squid Proxy Server, MySQL Server, Apache Web Server, etc...). I choice Calderas eServer distrubtion because it is taloried for web developers/administrators.The install is super easy, you can boot right off the CD-ROM and do a complete install on a fresh hard drive (or as a partion) in less than an hour (amazing since Windows 2000 Server takes about 2.5 hours to install). The install process is very intuitive and 100% painless, Caldera's Linux detected 100% of my hardware and found appropriate drivers, all I had to do was click the ""Next"" button.Once the Install was complete, I booted the system and was very pleased to find all the server apps I needed (MySQL, Squid Proxy Server, Apache, Tomcat JSP Server) all setup with default configurations and ready to go. You even get a web-based Admin tool that lets you configure all of these servers in one central place. I did have one or two ruff-spots, but since I didn't pay a penny for the OS .... I was able to buy a good book on getting started with OpenLinux.Highly recommended."

30516,1,"This must be the best idea Marvel has ever had.I found here comics I red as a kid, it brought many memories and spenta really good time remembering them.It is incredible the ammount of comics included here, there is no waste of money at all.The only true thing I regret is tt Marvel has cancelled its deal with GIT, the enterprise responsible for creating these treasures, and there will be no more DVD ROM from other titles, like Dare Devil or Thor.Instead, Marvel bets to comic online reading.As a Marvel fan, I really regret this, as I do not pretend to pay for comics tt I cannot keep and storage for my own kids.As a comic collector, I find Marvel's idea offensive.This DVD idea was great, as we all know tt paper comics cannot last forever.While many books are being digitalized, this kind of art suffers forcorporative matters, beyond art itself.Anyway, get this while they're out there, you won't regret it."

36325,0,"Just received this Silver Edition (Version 6.0) While I find the volume of recipes enormous, I also find the value of the information lacking. Good thing it didn't cost that much. On receipt I decided just to take a look at some recipes by browsing. Not an easy thing to do since only 9 recipe names are listed at a time. Looked at a few recipes and thought they might be worthwhile. Decided to check the nutritional information on a chicken breast recipe that sounded good. To my amazement the total fat and calories were VERY low. Looking at the ingredients used in the calculation I noticed that the chicken wasn't listed. Also missing was the stuffing mix. Needless to say that is where all the calories and fat would be located. OK, maybe I just got unlucky looking at that one. Checked a few others and the same thing. So if you are looking for nutritional information you can forget using it with this cookbook.Looking further into the recipes I found quite a few recipes that listed the ingredients but no instructions on how to prepare the dish. That makes a lot of sense. I guess I should know what to do in their opinion.Then there are the recipes that list the ingredients but doesn't list how much to use of each one. That isn't a recipe is it. Surely not in my book.I'm sure there are a lot of good recipes in the over 1 million available, but who in the world looked at this before making it available to the public. Obviously no one did. Someone download a bunch of unedited recipes from the internet and stuck them in a database and called it a cookbook. If you are willing to wade through all the recipes, you will find some good ones. That is the only reason I gave it 3 stars."

60134,1,"I had previously used Studio 8 to edit my movies and spent many, many hours trying to find work arounds and reasons for all of the crashes. Studio 9 is moderately better. I keep going back because it's very easy to learn and simple to use. I tried switching to Screenblaster and was really disappointed with the choices of transitions and menus. Studio 9 has a wide variety of menus included and even more if you're willing to shell out a little more money.I have a nice computer that I bought with video editing in mind and editing and rendering is still a slow process. The program tends to crash for no apparent reason so I've learned to deal with that by saving my work every 2 minutes. It's far from an ideal situation, but when I finally have my project edited and completed, it looks almost professional so that makes it worth the headaches to me.

Along with the math, spelling and reading sections, I particularly like the fact that the games promote good listening (i.e. following directions) skills. The kids have ""tasks"" to complete in order to open different sections of the world, rather than just wandering around aimlessly playing games. There are also parent reports that enable you to see how they are progressing (i.e. where their strengths & weaknesses are). You get 2 adventure packs with this software and then you can go to the website to order a new pack to be automatically downloaded every month (costs about $7.99 per month). I would definitely recommend these products. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was long to install (first instance only)."

Even the many magazine reviews I have read are not kind in their assessment. This is not a complicated or demanding task being asked to perform here. Scan my documents, all me to tweak them a bit, then save it to the folder of my choice. Why Nuance cannot provide a product that works after getting you to spend $100 I cannot figure out.I was lucky, I did not have to pay. I got a copy for free. I have worked with computers and networks and fixing them for years. With Vista this program was terrible. Even the most recent updates and help found on the website did not improve the situation.I tried and bought Presto! PageManager instead and have been very happy."

8464,0,"After retiring (from a career as a scientist), I took a job as a technical writer. My technical background and my interest in writing are good matches for this job, but the fact that I never became a touch typist proved to be a significant liability, especially since I record my thoughts while referring to source material. For this reason, I turned to voice recognition software. After surveying the voice-recognition software that was available, I purchased Dragon Naturally Speaking version 7. My computer was relatively new at the time and featured a 2 GHz processor, Audigy sound card, USB2 ports, and 512 MB of RAM, so I was comfortable with its ability to efficiently run the software. I have used this program for about six months, and the results are decidedly mixed.Despite having gone through the recommended training program, I find that the software continues to make a significant number of errors. The errors are never typos, and thus detected by one's spelling checker; they are errors of word selection, and thus careful editing is a must. Many of the errors are ones that you would expect - for example, ""an"" or ""in"" for ""and"" - but in some instances the choice of word by the software is so bizarre that if I do not catch it immediately, it is not apparent to me later, even from context, exactly what word I intended, which sends me back to the source material, and that of course takes time. Good enunciation and optimal positioning of the microphone are, of course, important. But I have found some words that the software missed by a mile no matter how carefully I enunciated or positioned the microphone. I have also found that some words that I asked the software to select and correct continued to be misinterpreted, suggesting that the software does not always learn from the corrections. So while dictation is easier than typing, editing for the inevitable errors results in dictation being no faster than had I typed it myself. I should point out that I have always dictated to DragonPad, where accuracy is supposed to be highest, and then cut and pasted into Word. One problem that I have noted with DragonPad is the apparent absence of an autosave feature, and I have lost material on occasion as a result.In surveying voice-recognition software, I noted the evaluations of microphones of several websites that dealt with voice recognition. As a result, I purchased a Sennheiser ME3 USB microphone, which was top-rated by one of the websites. Before making the purchase, I debated whether to buy a high-end microphone or a digital recorder. I settled on the microphone because of my inexperience using digital recorders for dictation and because of their cost. In retrospect, I wish I had purchased a digital recorder because of the freedom it provides: one must be at one's computer to use a microphone, and this I have found to be more inconvenient than anticipated.Based on my experience, this software makes the job of getting one's thoughts on paper easier but not necessarily faster than had one gone to the trouble of typing them. And woe to the person who fails to carefully edit what this software records. Does version 8 represent a significant improvement over version 7? At this point, I'm not prepared to pay to find out."
78779,1,"Turbotax was a great service, but I would like to be able to navigate with menus/tabs to a greater degree of specificity within the input pages itself. Writing the return often requires back-tracking to a page that you alread covered.To get to a particular prior page, I would often be forced to go through up to 5 or 6 prior pages, reading the question each time because turbotax highlighted the default which was not my previous choice. This was a colossal waste of time in an otherwise excellent product. It could easily be fixed in the 2006 software if turbotax 1) switched the defaults to the users' previously-inputted values (CompleteTax does this and it seems like an obvious thing to do) and/or made it easy to navigate to a prior page by giving a link to every input page when a user clicks a superior tab or link. This is what a good web-page does, and it would be very helpful if turbotax did the same."

35101,0,"I have to admit some culpability here. I am not an Apple products user. When I read the description for this product I assumed it meant ""convert video for use with handheld devices SUCH AS iPod..."" (Zune, Pocket PC, etc.) Well, no, it seems this converts only to Apple's format. So it is not useful to those of us who don't want to deal with Apple products.Roxio's guide clearly states that you can't convert commercial DVDs with this product; also, the entry ""Convert movies to watch on your PSP, DivX player, 3GP mobile phone, and more"" is marked NO. So, I really should have read the description more carefully.I can't comment on its usability, because I have none of the destination products to try it on. The packaging was nice. I've given it a straight 3 stars since I have no real idea how it works."

53045,1,"I have purchased and used every digital photo editing and management software product. I'm not from the software industry or write stories for PC magazines. I'm just a family man who loves his digital cameras and editing, playing and storing my digital output. Without a question, adobe photoshop one and two is the best product in the market. Its allows anyone, with GREAT EASE OF USE to upload their digital pictures, edit them, print and any other desire, and then store the pictures for long-term preservation. You all can save your time and money and avoid the other products in the market; just go with the best. On top of all this, the price is very reasonable.My only complaint is I was not aware of the 2.0 edition coming to market this past week, althought I'm very happy it came out and the new features are solid and make alot of sense."

Lots of different options for play. When it went missing, the children were so upset I had to go to Amazon and order a replacement. Only game they wanted to play for the last few weeks of school. Can't believe I waited so long so replace it."

44978,1,This company has a great product. The steps you use are unique from others and therefore some feel it should not be used by the majority. I am of the opinion let the manufactuer spend their time making a reliable product and I'll spend my time learning to make it work. File and Directory selection were the most confusing steps for me because Retro does it differently but once I understood it was a breeze. For me the wizard made it hard to understand but when I went to advanced mode then it all became clear.Certainly not for the New Kid on the Block but experienced file manipulators should not shy away from this product.

61834,1,"The basis for this game is very simple: Putt-putt lost his balloons and it's up to him and his dog Pep to get them all back (by popping them?). Even with all of this game's simplicity it is fun to play.The objective for each level is to use Putt-putt like a trampoline and bounce Pep around the screen until you pop all of the balloons, making sure not to let Pep fall to the ground! The balloons themselves come in a variety of types: normal colored balloons, balloon filled with candy (tasty, and they give extra points), trash (yuck, and they take away points), power ups (which can turn Pep into Super Pep, Putt-putt into a stretch limo, or a few other goodies), or balloons carrying paint buckets that can change Putt-putt's color. Every five rounds a space ship will appear and if Pep hits it you get to play a bonus round on the moon! The game does keep your current score and the highest score for anyone that has played it, so you can compete with others, or try to beat your highest score!The game itself is pretty simple, but if the player is having difficulties, there is a junior help button that can be used to prevent the player from losing lives (and thus never lose the game) and also make it easier for Putt-putt to catch Pep. Additionally, this game comes with a mode that lets players create custom levels anyway they want. I like to occasionally play this game because of its game play, nice music, and fun atmosphere."

11388,1,"I echo the other reviewers on Lightroom's capabilities, and highly recommend this software. I use Adobe's Creative Suite Premium CS3, and I'm a little miffed that Lightroom isn't included. Lightroom doesn't replace Photoshop by any means, and it doesn't have the overall photo/file review capabilities of Bridge, but it fills a much needed niche for Adobe. It's a must have for sorting large volumes of digital images, for reviewing directly from your digital camera, (be careful if your using it for B & W, i.e., TIF images scanned from negatives). Lightroom is terrific for creating web galleries, and probably indispensable for many digital photography tasks ... still left to explore/discover. I strongly recommend getting the free 30 trial before you buy."

94525,0,"I always use Norton AV on my computer, so I'm a fan of it. I was torn this year between just paying the $30 for updating my Norton 2005 for a year, or buying the new NAV 2006. Well, I wound up buying NAV 2006, as it said it has anti-spyware now, even though it was a few dollars more than just buying another year on last year's NAV. Well, I run both Spybot and Ad-aware on my computer regularly, and I haven't seen any decrease in the number of items they find! I thought with NAV 2006 keeping spyware off my computer, Ad-aware and Spybot wouldn't find anything anymore - I was wrong. My advice - just spend the $30 to update last year's version online - paying even a little extra for this year's version isn't worth it."

5329,0,"It is a worthy effort. It relies heavily on Climbing Parnassus, which is a wonderful book, the best apology for the study of Latin and Greek.Mr. Campbell's failure I think is to really make Latin the center of the curriculum. I have grave reservations for Latina Christiana. More importantly, I have a stern caution regarding Henle's Latin. Students will achieve great success at mastering the grammar of Latin, but will hit a road block if they ever try to read Latin texts. They will not acquire the idiom of Latin, the knack for the language.Mr. Campbell would do well to look at Sayer's other essay in which she deplored the fact that she studied Latin 20 years but never mastered it. THat is what will happen to those who use Henle.I recommend speaking Latin and the Oerberg approach. Younger kids need a more natural approach. Anyone serious about making Latin the center of the curriculum really, should read Newman's essay on Elementary Education in ""Idea of a University"". It is the finest piece Newman ever wrote (or at least out of the three books of his I've read). Newman's essay is online. Caveat: some sections are in Latin, and it is worth reading many times over many years. Also one should look very carefully at Sayer's other essay, especially the reference to Augustine at the end (concerning how and why he never learned Greek). Finally, one should carefully consider Oerberg's Latin books. Kids love then and will learn the idiom (as well as the grammar). Moreover, there is almost no ""memorization"" of Latin to English words. My 6th grade students are delighted (and much less frustrated than with other texts).That said, I do admire Campbell's attempt. I would give it more stars but for the cautions named above. Keeping these in mind, I highly recommend it to any homeschoolers intereested in ""classical"" education."
94566,2,"I am a long-time NAV customer (at least 8 years). NAV may still be an effective product, but the apparent contempt of Symantec for their customers is striking. My issues:1. Despite the fact that I pay for yearly subscription extensions and an earlier version of NAV worked perfectly well, Symantec notified me and a few million other customers that they will no longer support or provide new virus definitions for the older product. We HAVE to purchase NAV 2006. It is hard to believe that this is anything more than coercion.2. Despite the fact that I had several months of paid virus update subscription left, once I installed NAV 2006 my remaining subscription was wiped out. A call to customer support confirmed that this is Symantec policy. Thanks a lot!3. Installation of NAV 2006 rendered my older version of Norton Systemworks unusable. Hard to know if this is ""company policy"" or a technical glitch, in either case it was unacceptable.I was so aggravated by the whole ""upgrade"" experience that I deinstalled NAV 2006, sold it on ebay, and purchased AVG Anti-virus, which has worked flawlessly for several months and seems much faster than NAV."
26791,2,This item was not what I expected. The Instant Stitch Express items that are advertised everywhere else have 4 disks and this only came with two disks. Maybe that is why it was so inexpensive. It was also difficult initially to start-up on my computer but I finally got it running. I haven't used it yet however so can't comment on how well the software works in creating a garment.
50812,1,This worked great. The only thing was I had to skip the part using the 3.5 floppy but that did not matter I did what I wanted it to. When I got my computer I made the drive too small and this let me make the drive bigger without loosing data.Thanks
66048,1,"I am not overweight, having any health problems or pains or anything like that, and I am below 30. However, I am trying to use Yourself Fitness on a daily basis in order to avoid putting on more than a few pounds of extra weight and, probably more importantly, because it is invigorating. After a 30 minute workout, a shower and some watermelon for hydration, you will not feel tired, but more energetic, determined and optimistic.The way I do it is with a two-computer or a laptop-dual screen configuration. On one computer, I am running the fitness software muted, while on the other I watch an episode from a favorite series (preferably something funny, or generally light). With the two screens next to each other, you can folow the on-screen trainer and the show with no problem. The best thing about this is that it helps me exercise on a regular basis because it takes your mind away from the fact that you are exercising and you will begin to look forward to exercising by way of positive association. Of course, you can also set up your exercise when a favorite show is running on TV, or turn on the radio to a favorite show, or anything like that that prevents you from getting bored.As for the software itself, it is indeed as complete as it can get. You create a profile where you input the essential data about you, such as age, sex, weight, but also your pulse - resting and a after brisk exercise, flexibility, weight and current capabilities of your muscles, and all of this being guided by the software what to do. You can also set your goals and see your progress.The exercises themselves are highly customizable - what you want to focus on during any particular exercises, how long you want it to last, even how rested you are when starting the exercise, and you can decrease or increase the difficulty as you go.One option that I am not using is following a meal plan, which goes as far as adjusting based on how many calories you want to consume and gives you the recipes and the detailed nutrition information for the dishes in the plan.You also have a Yoga module, which I have not tried yet, beautiful environments for the virtual trainer, and you can unlock more as you progress, music tracks to go with the workouts, and simple, but interesting, health tips at the end of each workout.The only problem is exercising for 30 or 45 minutes, having sweat run all over you, and having the program tell you've only consumed 200 or 300 calories :-)"

77731,1,"After reading the less-than-winning reviews by others, I tried several less expensive alternatives - with less than stellar results. So I tested the Retrospect trial version that came with my Dell. I was impressed - so much so that I shelled out close to a C-note. And believe me, after once having suffered an unrecoverable crash, it's worth the peace of mind.If nothing else, the software comes with a well-written and illustrated printed manual (a rarity these days), and an equally lucid help section. True, some of the terms are arcane ('progressive' backup) and some are needlessly brought into play (like 'snapshots'). Yet the package does very well for beginners with it's outstanding wizards -- if you are willing to read just the introductory chapter to get familiar with the terminology.The pervasive ease-of-use fell short only in the vital 'Disaster Recovery' section: 1) nowadays most PC's ship with a manufacturer-specific Windows reinstallation disc that is 'unreadable' to the Retrospect media handler; how to create a disc image from the hard drive should have been geared more to the beginner; 2) totally unclear is how to make a bootable CD/DVD from the image; it would have saved me a lot of grief if the manual had only made it clear that the disc image is created in bootable format. That said, and realizing that few big-name computers ship with the original Windows installation disc, the company ought to have created yet another wizard so as to burn the disc image direct to a disc. I'm sure many users would be put off by the (totally unnecessary) extra step of having to exit Retrospect, then switch to another package to burn the Recovery disc image to a CD/DVD.With that caveat in mind, this is a solid, fast, highly reliable and well-documented piece of software. And, not the least, the Dantz company gives every indication of success - and thus the comforting reassurance that they'll be around for many years. Further, the website is informative and up-to-date, and the tech desk responds promptly and patiently. Retrospect fully earns its top-notch recommendations by PC-mag and PC-world."

28747,1,"I downloaded the demo version and played with it for a couple of days. It can be very frustating to use this tool in the beginning but once you get a hang of it, it is very nice. I designed a couple of different plans and was very excited to see the 3D view. This too, with the limited version that I had. Many of the features were not available since I was just trying a demo. I also downloaded the 3D home design and tried it for a couple of weeks. Although 3D Home design is easy to use, I like Punch.I just bought the copy on ebay and now eagerly waiting it to arrive."
41508,1,"Personal knows, I really like SUSE. It was my first Linux distro , it was my learning tool, etc. With that in mind, I'm proud to be able to review SUSE 9.2 PROFESSIONAL prior to its release to the general public.SUSE Linux Professional 9.2, as the Novell-Suse Distribution is known, has updated much of the distributions core technology. This includes the new Linux kernel now 2.6.8 from version 9.1's version 2.6.4. In addition, 9.2 has shifted the distribution from Xfree86 to the X.Org Foundation's X Window System.If you are a KDE user, you will be happy to know that SUSE has upgraded to version 3.3. GNOME users are not quite as fortunate as version 2.8 was released in September and the timing did not work for this release. 9.2 PRO has GNOME version 2.6. While not the newest, this is still a very feature filled release.SUSE Linux Pro 9.2 also has new redesigned interfaces to make the setup of network services like Samba, DNS, and DHCP easier than before.Other advancements in this distro include; GIMP 2, a comprehensive image processing and graphics creation tool, INKSCAPE, a new vector graphics application that is advertised to outperforms all other Linux alternatives, Nvu, a Web authoring system that combines Web file management and easy -to-use WYSIWYG Web-page editing, Open Office 1.1.3 and a host of other cutting edge programs.An area that Linux, in general, has needed to improve upon has been WIRELESS. Version 9.2 Pro now offers ""Bluetooth"" wireless support including automatic recognition of Bluetooth-devices via the YaST configuration and admin tool. Bluetooth configuration is simple using YaST making it easy to connect to and move between wireless LANs (WLAN) and other network connections. There is even a suspend-the-disk feature that makes it easy for laptop users who require increased mobility.WHAT ABOUT INSTALL AND USE?Those that have installed SUSE before are familiar with the Green Screen. The new SUSE 9.2 Pro has a very pleasant blue and grey screen, but beyond that, the installation is as smooth as always. Couple of questions, auto partitioning (I always turn the entire hard drive over to the distro) and the installer goes to work. Not unlike every SUSE install, after Disc 1 has been installed, the installer reboots. A couple of disc changes and you are ready to boot into your new system.Hardware detection is excellent. SUSE 9.2 PRO correctly detected all my hardware including my old HP printer and did the full set-up without problems.I booted into KDE and was quite pleased with the speed, quality of fonts and graphics. Using the Suse icon, I went to the Control Center and selected a screen saver and then checked Internet to see what was available for browsing. KONQUEROR was my only choice, so I went to YaST and selected INSTALL SOFTWARE. With YaST, if you have never used it, you can search for software in a number of ways. I chose to enter Mozilla into the search block and it came up with Mozilla and a host of plugins. Also offered in this distro is Mozilla's Firefox.After install, I checked to see what plugins had been installed, as I have a couple of sites on the Web where I go to play games! No JAVA! Not a problem, I made a directory and downloaded. Installing java in SUSE is a little different from other distributions. If you are using a Red Hat, Mandrake or a Debian distro, you can go to /usr/lib. Find Mozilla and install into the plugin directory. SUSE uses /opt/mozilla. If you are creating a simlink, your path to Mozilla becomes:/opt/mozilla/lib/pluginsOnce the symlink had been created, it was off to the Web to give it a spin. The system worked flawlessly and I noted how quickly the system responded to commands.Sound would be the next check. I went to one of the Web music services and selected a genre. Immediately, I had music playing using Real Time Player 10.0.So far, so good. The next test would be logging into my home network. The network consists of multiple LINUX machines in the Lab and a couple of WINDOWS XP machines in the household. The Windows machines are both wired and wireless (although it doesn't matter). Log in went flawlessly.First look appeared as expected...EXCELLENT! For those that had fears when SUSE was purchased by Novell, this distribution should eliminate any doubts that SUSE is going to continue bringing an excellent product, featuring many cutting edge programs. Their release schedule is aggressive with a new distro planned for every 6 months."

1723,1,"I was on a recent 2 week road trip for business where I had to make stops in several cities across the southeast and gulf coast. I don't know how I would have made it without this this product! I mounted my laptop in my car and it became my best friend on the road. The verbal turn by turn instructions as well as the visual distance till the next turn was very helpful. I also liked the ability to find a location around me (hotel, restaurant, gas station, etc.) I must say Microsoft did an EXCELLENT job with this product.Downside, there we a few locations that the sofware didn't find but only a few. Other than that I really recommend this product!"
81697,1,"This is a cool piece of software for what it does and the price point but, anything that says on the box it only requires a ""Windows-compatible sound card"" with no mention of ASIO is only going to go so far. I wish there was a sub-100 dollar solution for true professional multitrack recording but, this won't do it. It can do a lot of great things real easy and spits out a nice result but, at the end of the ""play-date"" remember to reload your Cubase SX or Protools and get back to real work."
68225,2,"When I bought this game, I thought I was getting the classic arcade version of Centipede that I always enjoyed playing. But this is a tricked-out 3D version that shares only the name with the original Centipede. I loaded it on my computer, played for about 15 minutes, then never went back to it. Forgot how much I disliked it the first time and loaded it on another computer, then remembered why it was sitting on the shelf. If you are looking for Centipede like you remember it from the arcade game, this is not it."
51356,0,"I bought this book mainly hoping I could find good illustrations of a diverse selection of people. I find that most of those illustrations are too cartoonish for editorial use, and don't show much variety. The high resolution photos were of no use either as they are actually only &quot;medium&quot; resolution. They would be great for web usage but not for print. Also, I wasn't able to use the electronic image catalog and was unable to search the photographs effectively since the file names are not descriptive.If you're looking for illustrations of things rather than people, then this is a good source. The vector images are well organized and the print catalog is easy to use. Overall, I'd say this is a good product, but I don't think it offers much more than the 525,000 or 600,000 image versions."
1480,1,"I purchased this stand alone version of Outlok 2007 due to the fact that I initially ordered Home & student Office suite 07 without realizing that Outlook is not included in the suite.. doh! Regardless, the amount i spent is still less than the Pro Office suite. I had no issues as some of the other reviewers here. Install - no problem, integrates with home and student suite- no problem. Shiping was fast - no problem!"
107,0,"The only redeeming quality of this game is being able to play your favorite Ultra characters in a game that feels like the first release of Mortal Kombat back in the 90's. The developers raised the bar high on the challenge of letting the user figure out how to start a game and how to win a match. Let's say that you will bang your head against the wall a lot. Even in ""easy"" mode, it's very difficult to defeat the bad guy, not to mention it's nearly impossible to figure out how to use the combination attacks, since there are no instructions. But it's fun to see the Ultras and the monsters moving around. Get it only if you really like Ultraman."
48144,1,"Although it is a bit slower that my other Delorme products, TopoUSA is very fun and satisfying to use. DVD is a must since it comes on 1 disk. I have spent hours visiting places via map that I have been and places I want to go. I have check the accuracy twice with my Garmin GPS 12 and have found X, Y and Z coordinates to be at least as accurate as the GPS Device. This program is a must for anyone who loves maps, hiking or Geology/Geography. Additionally, It should be a requirement for any SAR team. This is the best [money] I have spent in quite a while. Buy one now!"
87457,0,"The GPS works well (i.e. it tells you where you are on the map). As far as the routing, there are no voice prompts (helpful when driving alone), there is no distance countdown to the next turn (a great feature on other software), the zoom on the map resets itself when moving to the next turn instruction (zooms way out, quite annoying), the software does not automatically move to the next turn instruction (it really should when using GPS), and the software does not automatically recalculate a route when deviating from the recommended route (you have to push a ""go"" button which can be tough while driving). All in all, this software works better if you plan on traveling with another person to operate the laptop."
28923,1,"I like Works Data Base more than many other programs I use in my work.I am constantly telling people to try it - but they prefer to flounder with Access. (That's like driving a semi-trailer when a small sedan is appropriate, in my opinion.)I can manipulate the data base in many ways - and use if for book-keeping 3-4 large accounts.I also use it for sorting our students and classes at a school, and for recording marks.I find it very easy to use, and the only improvement I would like to see is an option to have more than 8 reports. (We have a school with ten classes - and I need 10 class reports!)I think this data base should be advertised strongly and widely, in competition to others which are not so user friendly, and not so economical."

91092,1,"I bought this when Windows 95 was the latest Microsoft offering. As I have upgraded my system I have kept this version of Acrobat. I thought it would need to be replaced when Vista came along but never did. Out of curiosity I reloaded it under Windows 7. A pop-up warned me there would be compatibility issues, but I ignored the message. It never said what the issues were, and I haven't found any, it does all I want to do. So I will put off upgrading until the next Windows upgrade, at least."

13489,2,"I hate iLok. Period. As a record producer and studio owner I own hundreds of software titles. I try my best to use only legitimately registered software with proper licenses. Having to use iLok is not only a huge inconvenience, it is a disgrace. Because so many people have stolen the use of software, today, honest people are penalized by forcing us to use this shameful system. Companies like Synthogy (makers of Ivory Piano) should be shamed for penalizing the honest because of the dishonest. Synthogy has a full challenge/response system in place that worked from day one. For some reason, Mac users wanting to run Ivory with Leopard were required to change over to use iLok. I begged Synthogy for the ability to choose one or the other, since the challenge/response system was already in place. They refused. They jumped on the iLok Big Brother Bandwagon, no doubt, to alleviate Customer Support calls to support challenge/response. Suddenly, competing piano software sounded so much nicer than it used to! Shame on you, Synthogy. I hate iLok!"
86783,1,My son absolutely loves this game! The first time he played I practically had pry him off the chair to go to bed. He really wanted to keep on gathering clues to reach the end challenge. The entire game teaches kids how to plan wisely so that they have enough sneeze berries to rescue the professor. I'd recommend it to any third grader.

48448,1,"I will never prefer something like this over FDISK (call me old fashioned), but this is the best there is as far as partitioning on the fly. As a matter of fact, although FDISK is all I would ever use, Partition Magic is what was used to partition my very first hard drive and that partition table remained intact for over a year before I finally redid it all.I did begin to have cluster problems towards the end of that partitioning campaign, but any partition table may develop problems over that time. Could be due to hardware as well.As far as &quot;on-the-fly&quot; partitioning goes, look no further. This seems perfectly safe for creating new extended partitions without damaging or losing data but I will never condone this practice. I've lost data once (not related to this) and I'll never take another chance again.I'm not going to get into any specifics with this product and make it look like a tech review because most of you just want to know if it works good or not...so in short, yeh it does. Nothing to date worth that 5 stars though!"

92111,1,"Though not as nicely designed or flashy as Photoshop Album, ACDSee has two decisive advantages over the Adobe product: (1) it handles networked files correctly (no local copies are created, and users have full control over caching and cached thumbnail size) and (2) it exports the information in its database to XML so that it can be used in other applications. Oddly though, the category information is not exported. ACDSee also does a much better job of dealing with file management overall. For example, if you use ACDSee's file browser to move files, it will update its database accordingly so you don't get broken links (a big and nearly fatal problem with Photoshop Album).In short, ACDSee is clearly superior to Photoshop Album (except on looks), but still not quite there.UPDATE (4/24/03): The latest free update (5.01) adds categoization data to the list of information exported! With this addition, ACDSee becomes far and away the best tool for organizing digital photo libraries. The only thing it still lacks is some of the flash of the Adobe product, but in terms of features and performance, this is the clear winner."

I found it especially difficult to articulate my plan in a manner that would attract investors and the bank. I purchased BizPlan Builder and developed my plan. There is a lot of detail in between, but, to get to the point.....my plan, thanks to BizPlanBuilder, became a multi-million dollar company located in five states, went public in 1996 and recently sold to a larger public company for more than $75,000,000."

But what I can tell you is if you think after you do all of the misins there is nothing els to do but you are rong if you said that there is always things to do like play games and go on the laptop and there is a tun of misens! Please don't turn it down it might be expensiv but it is worth the money!
33982,1,"Spring Cleaning is a great way to help get your Macintosh organized and cleaned up. Follow the easy guide and choose a cleaning utility like MacUninstaller to find folders, Apps, fonts etc. associated with a particular application, you can then choose to move them to a backup archive using StuffIt (I have all my Read Me files in one spot now), or a storage folder, or just plain move them to the trash. If you aren't sure, move them to a storage folder first, if everything's running smoothly after a couple weeks, then empty your storage folder. The iClean utility is awesome for getting rid of your Internet surfing tracks to get rid of cache, cookies and other junk (I use mine weekly)."
86084,1,"This is an excellent typing disk. The instructions are easy to follow and there is a LOT of variety, so it is easy to stay interested and motivated. In addition to the basic typing instruction and practice sessions, you can choose from 300+ magazine articles for speed building. These articles encompass a LOT of subjects. If you prefer to speed type a specific kind of material (such as an article from a medical journal, giving exposure to dense medical terminology), you can import articles from the Internet, and this program will provide instant feedback if you make an error and will calculate your speed as you type the article. You can also import your own music that will play while you type, or you can chose from a variety of music that they have (their music is a bit cheesy). Ten typing games add interest and variety. The quality of these games is not sophisticated compared to 2006 technology; nevertheless, the graphics and sound quality are good (especially Typing Shark Abyss). I had none of the problems described in the other review. This disk has won some impressive awards for excellence (search the Internet and you'll see)."

With all the files on my computer it seems my directory structure was extremely corrupted after two years.After one pass of the program I tried to rebuild the Mac Drive on the internal disk but it was so corrupted it didn't work. Next, I went out and bought an External hard disk but it was not formatted for mac so disk warrior would not copy the files to the non-formatted disk.So, again it took five hours to rebuild a disk image, but this time I came ready with a Mac formatted external drive. The transfer of the files worked and I got all the data off the internal Macbook drive.I found out a few days later that the disk had finally failed so it looks like disk warrior got the data out just in time.Great product."

23813,0,"I'd like to start by saying I only own the Beginners Spanish portion of this set. I am giving it 3 rather than 2 stars (2.5 would be my preferred rating) due to not having seen the other half and the low cost that this can be found would make it worth getting if you don't have a lot of money to spend and can live with some restrictions.Beginners Spanish is a reasonably straight forward introduction to the language starting with the alphabet, basic numbers and question words and building thru various situations and adding vocabulary. In the last chapter is some basic grammar information. The click it computer format let's you self-pace, and it isn't difficult to navigate thru the lessons.You can autoplay the lesson vocabulary list over and over if you'd like, or one at a time with clicking. The multiple choice testing helps you build your listening skills. There are mp3's of much of the program that you can take offline if you wish, though you really need to use that as a review as it is the english and spanish one time back-to-back so outside of the easier items such as numbers might be difficult to follow. If you want to repeat the spanish response you'd need to pause as they do not leave enough time to repeat the spanish portion.There are some problems with many spelling errors in the program, or cases where the spanish spoken is only part of what is written (though the gist of the meaning), or even occasionally uses the wrong pronoun/verb conjugation as compared to the written version (might in one version say ""We want"" Nosotros queremos and then actually say ""I want"" Yo quiero). The spanish is spoken slowly - and very slowly by one speaker. That can be good for starting but is not going to reflect reality and can seem annoying as you progress.The program jewel case says there is a record your voice feature, I cannot find it as an option, so it is possible this is a repackaging of an older program or the record feature is in the Everyday Spanish portion of the set. Don't be disappointed if you can't record your voice.If you are wanting to give Spanish a try but don't want to break the bank you might give this set a try as it can be found new at a great discount (appears to be .90 plus shipping here on amazon which is a great value - I may take advantage of this deal for the Everyday Spanish part of the set) compared to retail and even at retail it is less than some other basic sets but not sure I'd recommend it at full price."

81455,1,"I have been a devote used or After Effects for 6 years now. AE has never once let me down, and their upgrades have always been vast improvements over the previous versions (sometimes you didn't even know what could be improved in the first place, and Adobe would surprise you with something great).This package is no exception. For the improved 3D capabilities alone, this package is worth the upgrade to 5.0. As usual, Adobe has attempted to merge the feel of its other step-siblings (Photoshop, Illustrator, GoLive, etc) into After Effects, and has in fact done so quite well.Trust me: This is the same package that major motion pictures post-production companies use...the same package that is used in probably 90% of today's commercials... nothing is more straight-forward, well thought-out and just a pleasure to work with than Adobe After Effects. I highly recommend 5.0 to anyone."

46714,1,"If Topo maps still cost $2.50, I never would have purchased this product. Now that they cost upwards of $8, this product pays for itself fairly quickly.I like setting the waypoints on the map and then uploading to my Garmin eTRex (serial) GPS. I do not go the other way from GPS to map. The quality of the map printouts is good, and scaling is good although I wish you could set the variable manually instead of using the preset values.The paper is expensive but very durable. Best to make test prints on regular paper until ready to print for real. The paper size is a limitation (unless one has a large-format printer).If you want to just use this to browse topos, it's not a great tool. It's much better to have a larger format topo, say 1:25000 to get a rough idea of your route, and then use Topo to scan a small area. The screen real estate of a computer monitor is tiny, and really does not lend itself well to casual map browsing, especially at 1:24000 scale where it takes 8 screens to pan a map, whereas a real map can be panned by the naked eye.Anyway, I'm happy with the tool as long as the limitations are understood. This is for the PC version on W2K for Topo California. I just bought a Mac (yes!) and I hope the conversion utility works!Update 1/16/13: Wow, technology advances. Anyway, there are much better online sources for maps, paid and free. I personally use Mapping Support (link below) for online browsing of topo maps. It also works with google maps. So you can create routes in google maps and read them from Mapping Support on real topo maps. It's a geeky tool, so not for the non-techie enthusiast. [...]"
57475,0,I have been using Internet Security 2005 for all my computers and decided to try something different with a better rating so I bought this PC-Cillin for my son. It had a great rating. I found the installation to be pretty easy. It is after installing this software I found that registering this product was pretty difficult. There are 4 steps that are required to complete in order for the software to be fully installed. It is pretty confusing. I also could not load some of them because my son could not get on lots of web-site such as IM. I would rate this software okay because I don't feel it is user friendly.

It is a resource hog and will slow you down big time unless you have a fast system with broadband.This firm did not honor their advertised re-bait for my upgrade. I sent them everything requested, and they sent me back a card saying I forgot the UPC. This is false. I am meticulous about these re-baits. Furthermore, I was ignored by their customer service. Amazon censored an earlier review of mine. Just make sure you photocopy everything. I think they count on rejecting a percent of the claims to pad their profits. I for one will look to TrendMicro or McAfee next time around. Very disappointing experience."

59468,0,"Unlike many of the other reviewers, I am having no problems using this product. No crashes (running WinXP Pro on a 300 MHz Celeron from 1999). This may be because I am only using it to model a 1000 sq. ft. condo.This program is a fine one for testing interior design ideas. I'll be ther first to tell you that the tutorials, help, and manual are horrible. It took me 2 days to figure out the main power of the program (which isn't really mentioned in the manual). This program is great if you have objects or textures that you want to import and apply to walls, floors, or the generic furniture in the program. It also has a lot of power when you start browsing the product catalog (note: Items in the catalog are separate from items in the program, but can be imported and look ok when they are.). When using the program, learn to use the product catalog, import features, and design center early. It's confusing, but it will be worth it. I am still confused by this process (along with many others).This program is very counter-intuitive, but there are ways to figure stuff out. Expect to get part done with a project and then realize that you have to start over. YOU CAN GET GOOD INTERIOR DESIGN IDEAS AND RESULTS FROM THIS PRODUCT BUT NOT MUCH MORE. It is not 'Home Designer' software. Don't expect to design a house and give the plans to your builder.I only paid $25 for this program and am glad I didn't pay the MSRP of $40. It's worth the money I paid for it. If I wanted something better I would have gone with BHG's Home Designer Suite 6. You can download a demo at Chief Architects website. It's a better program, but costs 3-4 times as much.You can decide for yourself. If you're actually building something (addition, whole house, etc.) don't go with this program, it won't help you at all. If you just want to see what your living room will look like with a different color paint, floor, or furniture then it's worth a shot."

Pretty good program, lousy company. Try other programs before you settle on Quickbooks and get locked in."
43111,0,"OK, Microsoft solicited this review, or I might not have taken the time to write it. Word is the standard, and I really have no choice about using it. I had to buy the latest version because I upgraded to a Vista machine, again because I have little choice but to keep up with technology.They added some good features, like for inserting citations and references. I wish I had known about these before investing in other bibliographical software for this. The two do not work seamlessly together. I might have refrained from loading the add-in if I had better explored what was already in Word. The Word citation function isn't perfect, but I'm not sure add-ins make it that much better. Wouldn't it be nice if Microsoft could partner with NoodleBib or Dr Paper?I haven't yet needed to use the other modes in Office (Excel etc.) but I know I will have to soon. I guess I'm still not used to Vista. Just a neccesary evil, and I'm sure eventually I will not even notice it. It is powerful and flexible, but I haven't wanted to spend any time getting used to its new bells and whistles."
4713,1,"I upgraded from Norton Internet Security 2002 with a download, mostly to get the anti-spam capability. Download went fine. Upgrade went okay, although my system did hang on the second boot after installation. The problem disappeared with another boot. I have not noticed any speed problems. Old programs from System Works 2001 work fine. Symantec says that Norton anti-spam does not work with the Windows XP beta, but I have version 2 of that beta and there isn't much of a problem; a toolbar sometimes does not display, but the filter works great.I expect that some of the problems people are having with this program are related to incorrect firewall configuration, and I must say, you do have to get used to the firewall. But I have been using this firewall for 3 years, so re-configuring it correctly was not a problem for me.I'd recommend this product over a an anit-virus subscription renewal, just for the anti-spam feature."

46736,1,"GPS Compatibility...As advertised, TOPO! works well with GPS units. I use it with a Garmin Vista Cx GPS frequently. Other people's negative reviews concerning GPS compatibility probably stem from their assumption that they should be able to download the maps themselves to a GPS device. No, you can't do that with just TOPO.As advertised, you CAN download waypoints or routes before a trip, which becomes extremely helpful when you feel lost. And you CAN upload waypoints and tracks after a trip, which is very interesting to map where you've been.General Comments on the Software...This is an excellent product which I always use before going exploring or mountain climbing. I discover new features in the software all the time. I don't think the program has ever crashed on me, and it is not hard to learn. 5 stars!!"

46612,1,"This piece of software is what I have been hoping for for since I bought my machine. It is the most elegant and detailed mapping system that I have used. With the Garmin Vista Cx it works flawlessly. You can download any or all of the map data from the disks into the ""Topo"" file and it runs very well on my powerbook G4. It will upload all waypoints, and routes. It will download all waypoints, routes and tracks! The maps are gorgeous! The interactive web feature is cool but young. It has a geocaching feature. The 3d maps are sweet! It downloads updates and new map layers almost perfectly (had to manually download the software update). I only wish that waypoints symbols would transfer to and from my unit but I can easily live without them. Load the Mapsource maps to your device (Garmin ""x"" series saves to swappable memory microSD cards) and use Topo! from your laptop."

42394,0,"I'm a professional user of Excel 2003 and I purchased the Home edition of Office 2007 to use for my own budgeting and to learn VBA and macros.Bottom line: if you've never ever used Office before, this edition has the shortest learning curve of any in the line. If you're an experienced user, you will be frustrated by some things (such as the suddenly very hidden Save As function).Had I been able to find a copy of Office 2003, I would have purchased it. While this edition is every bit as powerful as its predecessors, Office 2007 perplexes me because, after more than a decade on the market, Microsoft created a product designed to be used by someone who has never seen it before. The impressively short learning curve makes for a cumbersome interface, ie you have to do a lot more with the mouse. I know that appeals to most casual users, but it is a real time drain when you're used to the faster keyboard interface.I am very glad that most of the 2003 key shortcuts (which make Excel much faster to use and therefore more efficient) are still in 2007. Actually, all of them might be there - I haven't tried all of them. If these had been taken out, I would have asked for a refund and instead tried to find a bootleg of 2003.The new graphical utilities are gorgeous, and it is something I'm looking forward to using fully when my company upgrades sometime in 2009."
70158,0,"I bought this to help evaluate my children (age 6), with whom I homeschool. They loved using this program. It took them each about an hour to complete all the tests, which they eagerly did in one sitting. The directions were clear and they did not need any help from me. The issue I have with it is that while my children's reading scores appeared accurate, their math and spelling were way off the chart - scoring on the 5th and 6th grade level, which I can surely attest they are not at that level. The trouble with the spelling section is that they only have to choose the correct spelling from a field of 3-4 options. My children are very good readers and can pick out the correct words. However, that does not translate to actually spelling a word from memory. They are two very different skills. I have no experience with other multiple choice achievement tests so I don't know if others measure spelling in similar ways. As for the math, I really am not sure how they scored so high. I can only assume that they guessed very well. Also, the way they measure IQ scores seems a bit skewed as well. A major part of the score relies on the one game that is difficult to play if children are not fully adept with the mouse. They have to be able to use the drag and drop feature fairly well. I suppose children with a lot of computer experience might not have much difficulty, but my children appeared to become very frustrated by this game and easily gave up on questions if they couldn't get the mouse to do what they wanted it to. This brought down their score considerably. The program (being only a static computer program) doesn't take into account the large discrepancies between the very high achievement scores and the fairly low IQ scores. Even a small notation when this occurs would be helpful to the parent - ""The achievement scores and IQ scores do not correlate as well as would typically be expected. This could be due to...""All in all - it's a fun game for the children to play to help prepare them to answer questions on a standardized test. It offers a good baseline for parents to evaluate their children but I would not rely on the results for curriculum planning or grade placement."

I installed this software on a Gateway 9100XL laptop (PII 300, 128 MB RAM). Install went perfect and I now have a dual-booting Windows 98SE/Linux machine.The install didn't require any real intervention on my part (other than to choose a couple of hardware options)."
62618,0,"MapSend has a reputation for being not so good for use as an automobile route manager. I maintain that is an accurate description, BUT.....This software will turn your fabulous hiking and geocaching GPS into a partially functioning road map. Mapsend will load onto your Magellan and you can point to a spot on the map, or specify a point of interest, and Mapsend will give you a road route to get to that point. It gives you a good route about 50% of the time, a circuitous route 25% of the time, and misses the mark completely about 25% of the time. On a recent trip out west, I pre-loaded routes into the Magellan from home, and, suppplemented with printed google map instructions, we got to where we wanted to go pretty well. If you take a side trip or get off track, mapsend is handy for finding your way back to where you wanted to go (recalculate route). For example, I would mark our hotel as a POI. Once we were done wandering around town finding a restaurant and eating, I would tell the GPS to get us back to the hotel, and it did so pretty well.Don't expect this to be a Garmin or Tom Tom. I would suggest it if you want to save some money and not invest in another GPS. Do expect to spend a bit of time figuring out how to download base maps to your unit, though. A good project for a day you are home sick."

68085,0,"I have used Pinnacle Video editing software professionally for several years. My experience with Pinnacle has been positive and I have produced a lot of work with their software. I think Pinnacle has really pioneered video editing for home use as well. Indeed I'm quite familiar with their versions of Studio 7, 8, 9 and 9 plus. I recently purchased their STUDIO MediaSuite for home use. It seemed like a nice package to have video, audio and photo editing all in one. Actually, I didn't need the photo editing because I use Adobe's Photoshop Elements (a really solid piece of software).The short answer is that the video component works quite well. The interface is easy to understand and use. I'm sure most folks would be up and running in no time. Don't forget to check their web site for product updates.The sound editing capability is another story. Pinnacle has (apparently) licensed Steinberg WaveLab Lite as the audio editor. WaveLab Lite is a home version of its more robust professional software. The first big problem I ran into using WaveLab is that it has no ability to rip CDs. None. This is quite surprising since that is one of the claims Pinnacle makes for this software on the outside of the box. So if you purchase MediaSuite you will have to purchase a separate software for ripping CDs. The second problem is that neither Pinnacle nor Steinberg will support WaveLab Lite. This makes a certain kind of business logic sense Steinberg doesn't sell it and Pinnacle doesn't own it. Yet it's an orphaned software that no one will claim as their own and will not support. So be forewarned that if you purchase MediaSuite then you are on your own if you have any problems with it.Other than that, this seems to be a fairly good product all in all."

There is no risk in trying it and you will be pleased with the results. A LiveCD is available so that you can try it before buying it. LinspireLive! won't touch any of your existing data and it will still run flawlessly right off the CD. And even if you choose to install it, you won't have to format Windows and lose all your data. Simply make another partition and Linspire can live there, totally separate from Windows (yet you will be able to view Windows files in Linspire). When the computer boots up you can select to start Linspire or Windows.If you like what you see, you should purchase Linspire along with Click-N-Run. CNR is Linspire's heart and soul. It allows for easy installation, removal, updating and management of over 2,000 quality programs and it is as simple as clicking the running man next to the appropriate program. CNR will handle all the rest of the grunt work, leaving a clean and up to date system.Try Linspire! It's a great operating system with an active and helpful community as well as a company that really listens to its customers. It won't hurt and you will thank me for it. ;)"
41918,1,"This software based on a modular system will give you the chance to create your own 3D Community easily and without needing a huge programming skill. In fact the modular system makes me think about Authorware products, the use of them is as easily as that. The 3D creation module is based on a WYSIWYG concept and makes one able to create easily 3D Rooms or Zones by inserting either objects and textures from a huge Library or even by importing 3D Max objects thanks to a 3D Max Export plugin.Only one thing could make you think twice before buying the product, the hosting requires a proprietary Server but with such a user friendly and quality program hosting partners will arise quickly and the bundle comes with a Free 3 month hosting by Cryo Networks."
73909,0,"I bought this game for my daughter's 7th birthday. She is a real 'My Scene' Fan. She loved it, the idea of making her own music, designing her own clothes, and dressing her own shop windows. She did get frustrated with the designs when she was told they were not right. It encouraged reading, which I liked, and problem solving. On the negative side, the girls who play the games are not 16-year-olds, like the girls featured in the game, and some of the commentary and attitudes, I felt were not appropriate for the young girls playing, as I had to remind my daughter on occasions."

73144,1,"I just installed this program recently, and so far it has been perfect. Quick install, easy interface to use, it's not a memory hog like Norton and Mcafee. I am using it only for the Virus scan and firewall, and it eliminated on the first scan some spyware (trojan horses) that I couldn't get rid of previously with other antivirus and anti-spyware programs. I am running XP with a cable connection and the update system is flawless so far, and I would recommend this to any level of user, whether you're a novice or switching from another program. I read some online reviews as well as industry recommendations on this program, and they have been right on the money."
71667,1,"Picture Publisher has always been my choice of photoediting software and I have used most major programs with the exception of the last two releases of Photoshop. To put it simply Picture Publisher is one of the easiest programs to use and has more power than any other program except Photoshop.I am prejudiced, however. I go back to the version one of Picture Publisher when it was put out by Astral. I was a member of the Micrografx user group in Dallas and was the leader of the group for several years. Until this last year I have been in close contact with many of the Micrografx employees. On the other hand, I have also worked with many other graphics programs and have reviewed several for the North Texas PC User's Group.First, Picture Publisher is more intuitive to use than most programs. With the &quot;how to&quot; features in the wizards, almost any photographic manipulation function is a snap. Unlike some programs, the wizards allow a great deal of flexibility. If you want &quot;quick and dirty&quot; you can have it. If you want to exercise control, you have that ability too.Second, Picture Publisher is powerful. Many of the &quot;new&quot; features in the high end graphics programs (read Photoshop) have been in Picture Publisher for years. Micrografx had objects several years before Photoshop. The task list through which you can edit any step of your photoediting session has been around for three versions of the program. These two features alone allow you almost infinite control over your images. With objects, you can define &quot;things&quot; in your pictures like individual people. These objects can then be processed independently of the rest of the picture. I can -and do- cut objects out of one picture and add them to another and retain full control of the object independent of where I put it. And I can keep this independence forever. The task list allows you to go back through an editing session and change single steps. If you darkened a section of your image several hours back and decide that it was not a good thing to do after several hours of photoediting, you can go into the task list, eidt out that step, and automatically redo all subsequent steps. The process to do this is simple.Third, Picture Publisher is fast and does not make excessive demands on your computer. My old P133 with 48 Meg of memory can and does run Picture Publisher. While not blindingly fast, it is acceptable. On my PIII-600 all operations are done in real time including all the special effects.The only disappointment in PP9 is that it is not a quantum leap over PP8. There are a few new features and many new wizards but overall the program does not have as many new features as have earlier versions of the program. Sure, the real time color channel manipulations make some things easier but overall there is no great need to upgrade from PP8.For the difference in price PP8 is a slightly better buy, but with such a small difference in the cost, you might as well go for version 9. Compared to anything else on the market, either version is a steal."

28131,1,"Honestly, if you do not have this software product in your collection, you are missing out a lot of great stuff here. The value that you are getting for your money here is worth every penny. From wordprocessing to photoediting I think this is 100% better than Microsoft Works Suite, the value appears in terms of more software and even hardware, I do not see anywhere in Microsofts Works where you are getting a headset, and Avery publishing software is truly exceptional I have version one of that software (it came with Office 97 Pro) and does every thing perfect, creating list, business cards etc imagine what you could do with this new version. Photo-editing software is satisfactory, its no Photoshop but it does get the job done. Lets not forget, Dragon Naturally speaking an excellent Voice Recognition software, it really takes the hassle from those who hate to type, one thing to remember, to get the best results from Dragon you have to practice, so that it can get use to your voice. You are also getting tons of Clipart, what else can I say but this product is better than MS Works Suite and is worth the [price]. Buy it you won't regret it."
59846,1,"I have worked with FrontPage since version 97, which was, overall, a real stinker. I have also worked with Dreamweaver since its earliest versions. In times past, FrontPage has largely been the site management and application development leader of the two, while Dreamweaver was much better at templating and all of the eye candy, like mouseover images, that we have become so fond of using in our sites.Having said that, FrontPage 2003 is a great step in the right direction. Here are my feelings, broken down:Site ManagementSite Management has improved in FrontPage 2003, although the most bang for the buck will be Enterprise users who have decided to use SharePoint Portal Server in their organization. Much of the new data functionality relies on SharePoint. What this means is FrontPage 2003 gives a lot more power for those in the Microsoft world. Note that it is still backwards compatible with frontPage 2002 extensions, for those without SharePoint.BehaviorsMuch of the work in this area is like Dreamweaver and it is a mixed bag. On the positive side, behaviors are more flexible in FrontPage; on the negative, there are still many missing from FrontPage. The major behaviors are there, however, so I would give FrontPage a plus here.Intellisense and codingMicrosoft has always lead the charge in this area and FrontPage is no exception. The Intellisense in FrontPage 2003 extends into ASP and ASP.NET code. For developers interested in altering the code created, everything is accessible. The death of FrontPage extensions are the reason, so those with backward compatible sites will have to deprecate some features if they use webbots. The small price is well worth the gain.CSSFrontPage has much greater support for CSS than previous versions, and is especially useful for those who like to work with graphical tools or those who like to work with code. The tag explorer, in Dreamweaver, wins for those who sit in the middle, however.HTML EditingThe ability to go back and forth from code to design and retain positioning is a real godsend. This feature exists in Dreamweaver, as well, so it is not as stellar as some of the other tools. One of the nicest tools is the tag explorer, that allows you to see the nesting of your currently selected tag and easily navigate up and down the tree. In addition, there is a code editor that lets you isolate on a specific tag and use Intellisense to code its attributes. There is also a tool that allows you to quickly find a closing tag, which is a godsend for any developer working with nested HTML tables.Themes and templatesThemes are much more easily edited in FrontPage 2003, which allows designers to alter templated sites to make nice looking custom built sites very quickly. FrontPage also has the ability to create ""master page"" style templates which are, possibly a surprise, fully compatible with Dreamweaver MX.That pretty much covers the major features. Overall, I like the FrontPage methodology of using a side pane that focuses on the task at hand over Dreamweavers sliding tool palette, although I know people that are more fond of the Dreamweaver IDE.One of the biggest benefits I have seen of FrontPage 2003, in the FrontPage/Dreamweaver battle, is Dreamweaver's tendency to lock up the OS when working on files on a shoddy network connection. As this does not apply to as many users, it is not reason enough to shy away from Dreamweaver. As I use both, I do not want to shy away from either, but here is how I would stack it up.FrontPage wins with its table designer, Intellisense, coding aids (esp. ASP.NET) and flexibility in behaviors. Dreamweaver still wins with the number of eye candy features, strength of its added CSS tools and its flexibility in coding models (nice for developers who work in more than one language - Java, ColdFusion, ASP and ASP.NET included)."

62918,0,"I did some research and found a nice product, that is essentially Acrobat Standard Edition called CutePDF Professional. Price was only $50 and comes with a form filler product to enter/save data in PDF forms ($30 if you only want their form filler product). Can also edit PDF form fields, merge PDF's, and change PDF page odering (all handy for when I scan stuff to PDF and find out after the scan I messed up one page, I can fix this now!). This is the basic funcitonality I needed and was bummed that I thought I had to drop a few hundred dollars on Acrobat Standard Edition to do this. I was a hairs breath from buying Standard Edition but found CutePDF with a little web searching while looking for used copies of Standard edition. Only thing I would ""like"" that it doesn't do is edit existing text in a PDF (not text form fields, those are fine), but then again, you need Acrobat Professional to do that anyway, and that's very expensive. Hopefully, CutePDF wil motivate Adobe to create another Acrobat product category for we simple home users that need such basic functionality (especially saving forms) a few times a year but don't want to drop a few hundred dollars to get this. Yes, Reader can save forms IF the person sending you the form enabled it to allow Reader to save form data, but that's a pain, since that doesn't always happen, and forms are passed along or downloaded and this is an impossibility sometimes. They should make a Reader that allows saving forms after entering the form data for say a price of $40. I would have bought that in a second. The lack of this product led me to find CutePDF. By the way, the $50 price for CutePDF Pro appears to be a special price offer (it's normally $90), but form filler appears to have a standard price of $30."
70451,1,"This is a sweet program, and it has TONS of features that make it absolutely easy to oragnize information and build systems to run a business.Unfortunately, it's not an enterprise application in some ways, and it lacks features like the ability to encrypt date internally, so despite it's easy web publishing capabilities, it's not the program to run your fortune 500 off of.The interface to the program is sweet, and you can do just about EVERYTHING with filemaker, including client server applications, and distributed data management.I would reccomend this program to my family, but I can't give it 4 stars because it tries to be all things to all people, and isn't."

39165,1,"Times sure have changed. When I was growing up we could read a book, or see a film or listen to a teacher explain something. Now, however, in addition to all these ways of learning, CD-Roms have been added to the mix. Not as a substitute, of course, but as an enhancement. This kind of software makes an excellent gift for children, for families, and for history buffs who just can't get enough. It's fun to just click a mouse and hear the sights and sounds of the experience of the millions of people who arrived America through Ellis Island from 1892 to 1954.It takes a full two hours to view this CD if a person would view it all at once, but of course it can be returned to again and again. There's a lot of information here, but, more than that, it is an experience. We hear the sound of the steamship whistles, we see rare films and photos of the immigrants, we listen to oral histories, learn about the Old World and its political upheavals, the challenges the immigrants faced, the whole story of immigration.Perhaps it was the intent of the program, but I found it impossible to view this in a logical order. I just clicked away in a variety of areas which kept opening up to deeper and deeper layers of historical fact and insight. Some of it could be absorbed quickly, such as the wonderfully interactive portion where a short re-enacted film shows immigrants walking up to inspectors. The viewer can vote &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; and then see what the actual outcome would likely be. There are other parts though that require a lot of reading and patience.There is always something new to learn and even though I think I know a lot about Ellis Island, I must say that I learned some new facts, especially since the easy navigation on this software allowed me to click on the things that interested me the most. The one thing I didn't like about the program was the musical score in the background which I found brooding and distracting. Please understand though that I'm a person who complains about background classical music in restaurants.I am definitely enthusiastic about this CD-Rom and recommend it highly. And for those of you who might never have tried a CD as an educational tool before, I say &quot;Try it; you'll like it.&quot;"

The downside is that Microsoft seems to think I installed XP on another machine (the virtual one) and won't let me register (I'm still in the 30-day grace period).

The message boards are great with employees? and people who give real answers that work.Also, I've even stopped using tables for alignment now because it's so easy to just drag and drop images and text anywhere you want. Then you can control positioning of objects by clicking below.Bottom line: If you are a beginner wanting to make professional webpages, you gotta get this. For people like me that are pretty experienced, you still gotta get this. I am finishing up a completely overhauled company website now that I budgeted 2 months to do. 4 days so far, and 2 more days to finish."
52560,0,"Overall I'm pleased with my purchase of Money Standard 2003. It's a very useful tool. The account register allows for categorization of all transactions, which produces interesting reports on how all your money was spent and the bills section makes sure you won't forget to pay those many bills on time. However, if you read the fine print on the bottom of the box you'll notice that it says that portfolio quotes downloading functionality and the ability to synchronize your data with MSN Money expire 1 year from first use of Microsoft Money Standard or September 1, 2004, whichever is earliest. Now what is the point of that?! It sounds like part of the software becomes useless after a year. But since I will have gotten it for free after rebates (not counting the time value of money), I suppose I can't complain too much."
46748,1,"If Topo maps still cost $2.50, I never would have purchased this product. Now that they cost upwards of $8, this product pays for itself fairly quickly.I like setting the waypoints on the map and then uploading to my Garmin eTRex (serial) GPS. I do not go the other way from GPS to map. The quality of the map printouts is good, and scaling is good although I wish you could set the variable manually instead of using the preset values.The paper is expensive but very durable. Best to make test prints on regular paper until ready to print for real. The paper size is a limitation (unless one has a large-format printer).If you want to just use this to browse topos, it's not a great tool. It's much better to have a larger format topo, say 1:25000 to get a rough idea of your route, and then use Topo to scan a small area. The screen real estate of a computer monitor is tiny, and really does not lend itself well to casual map browsing, especially at 1:24000 scale where it takes 8 screens to pan a map, whereas a real map can be panned by the naked eye.Anyway, I'm happy with the tool as long as the limitations are understood. This is for the PC version on W2K for Topo California. I just bought a Mac (yes!) and I hope the conversion utility works!Update 1/16/13: Wow, technology advances. Anyway, there are much better online sources for maps, paid and free. I personally use Mapping Support (link below) for online browsing of topo maps. It also works with google maps. So you can create routes in google maps and read them from Mapping Support on real topo maps. It's a geeky tool, so not for the non-techie enthusiast. [...]"
59645,1,"My 5-year old really enjoyed the game the first few times. However, since the location of the clues never changes, it lost some of the excitement after that. He still likes the accomplishment of completing the game, and the chance to solve the mystery at the end. The graphics are good. This one is a little easier than the Phantom of the Knight - this gives more verbal instructions how to find the clues. Overall, for young Scooby fans, I highly recommend this and Phantom."

50953,2,Useless product. I've tried it on two different computers without any luck. It won't copy any of the DVD's that I tried. Wasted 5 DVD + R DL media so far. I've talked to support services and they were useless.
48149,1,"Imagine a lump of modeling clay that is infinitely pushable, pullable and paintable. Then add the ability to twist or bulge, or add waves or spikes in a statisfyingly symmetrical way to the whole shape with one mouse drag.Amorphium throws away the wire frames and gives you real time smooth 3D rendering as you shape and color. This modestly priced package is both intuitive and fun for kids and sophisticated enough for professionals to create compelling organic images. The interface lets you play and discover without reading one word of the guide, but there are a few interesting features that the guide can point you to.What many other graphics packages let you do with painting, Amorphium lets you do with shaping. You can select different shaped objects to poke with (shaping brushes) and select the size and pressure. You can choose to poke or pull from behind to mirror what you do in front, and then rotate object in space and see what you created from any angle. You can even use a mask with shaping operations. Shaping tools will not affect masked out areas but mask edges are still nice and smooth.Best of all, as you press, your tool goes towards the center of the object in the 3d space so you can continue to refine surfaces in any plane.Users of Bryce will recognize the interface style. With most of the tools (other than brushes), you click and drag on the tool icon itself and watch the main image as it changes in real time. For some tools a percentage number will appear unobtrusively if you want to note numeric values for future reference. My only quibble with this style is that the interface palettes of icons are rather dark. I feel like I am indulging my computer graphics addiction in a closet.The features include applying images from other files to your object for shape or color, morphing from one shape to another, and animating your object to create movies.The really fast and fun tools are called ""distorts"", which are like Photoshop filters (but much faster). You click and drag on the ""distort"" name and watch the shape twist or grow spikes or waves in response to the direction and length of the mouse drag. Applying one ""distort"" after another gives truly infinite and beautiful variety of form."
69780,1,"I agree with the reviews that Four Seasons is a little tight, that you're not sure which clothes go with which season(coordinate by color), and when Caillou spins (in the racing game) it's suppose to be a bad thing; however, my son and I LOVE this CD. He is 5, and we love discussing the seasons of the year and learning the exciting characteristics of each. I haven't seen any other software that teaches this. See-saw, build a snowman, rake leaves, ice skate, and roller blade thru the year. As you work thru the activities you collect items for your &quot;Nature Book.&quot; When you've completed a season you can print the nature book, staple, and color. My son loves Four Seasons, and I reminisce about going through the seasons in my own childhood. Educational, fun, sweet - you can't miss!"

12074,1,"I am very impressed with the WinXP Pro upgrade. The look of the new screens is pleasant, however I really bought it for the much ballyhooed uncrashability. Since I fixed a hardware conflict (by fairly unscientific meddling in device manager, right down to changing interrupt settings for one of the peripherals) there have been no crashes. However, while I was experiencing the conflict (between a modem and a wireless LAN card) the system did freeze completely, no response to anything including CTRL-ALT-DEL - which very much disappointed me. Tech experts will no doubt feel that Microsoft cannot anticipate every hardware combination, and this is of course true. But XP is advertised as crashproof, and its worth saying that there are some hardware combos that can defeat it.Although I bought it for the uncrashability, other unanticipated benefits have accrued that make me want to recommend it. In particular, the speed of bootup and the ability to detect and work with peripherals (especially the aforementioned wireless LAN card, after the conflict was sorted out) has impressed me a great deal. I bought my computer, an IBM thinkpad, in Nov 01 (in other words, it is a fairly current piece of kit) and the previous operating system (Win98SE) took 2 minutes to boot up, mainly spent (I believe) looking for and handshaking with my wireless LAN card. WinXP boots up in about 30 seconds. Hibernation is an order of magnitude quicker, it used to take forever under W98 and now takes about 20 seconds with 384MB of memory. Also hotswapping between wireless and wired LAN is possible, and XP's ability to save a session for one user while another one logs on is very cool (useless to me (although I did try it for fun!)...but very cool for a family machine, I imagine).I understand that Win2000Pro has many of the advantages of XP (but not user switching), but if you have W98 or a previous system, and meet (preferably exceed) the machine requirements, XP is a worthwhile upgrade."
1716,1,"Excellent software, it could use more user help or be a bit more frendly. Instalation is somewhat confusing but once is up and running works fine. I would sugest more in detail maps for regions outside the US and options for more zooming, this would make it a better software even if it cost more or to give the option if needed to get a more detailed map for the region the user lives at."

14970,0,"The concept of this program is excellent, however there are some serious shortcomings in the software. Once you enter a song in the compose mode and then go into the sing mode and sing with it you can no longer go back to the compose mode to edit the song with out changing it's title. Also if you enter a song in a given key, save it, there is no option to allow you to open it up in the original key - the program automatically changes the key to fit your voice and if that's not where you want it, the onus is on you to remember the key in which you entered it if you want to reset it back to that key. An extensive tutorial would be a welcome improvement."
57247,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

27321,1,"First let me say that all of the Pajama Sam games are great. However, this game dragged a little as compared to the other two games. There seemed to be a lot more needless running around to get things. Also, unlike #1 and #3, there was no danger. In #1 you had the impending meeting with &quot;Darkness&quot;, and in number three you have to get the peace delegates together to circumvent a &quot;food war&quot;. (In number two, angry Mother Nature just didn't do it for my kids, 10 and 5). The sense of danger gave games #1 and #3 more of a sense of purpose than game #2.Sam is a great role model for kids. He's polite, energenic, helpful and up to a challenge. And everyone in the family loves his sense of humor.I recommend all of the Pajama Sam games. They are all great and any differences are really splitting hairs. However, my kids favorites in order of preference are: #1, #3 then #2. I hope this helps."

36199,0,"I tried out this program and ended up also trying out Sage and Windows XP Media Center which was installed on my computer.I started with an AMD dual core desktop computer, 3 MB RAM, an HP 17"" monitor and a Pioneer 42"" plasma TV as my video displays, 400 GB of hard drive, new Hauppauge HDTV tuners (one a PCI card, HVR 1600 and one a USB dongle, HVR 950) for my computer, and also a Radeon X1300 video card to give me a video output.Here are my impressions of the three programs:Beyond TV4 (version 4.6) had little to no useful documentation but was pretty intuitive in the setup. It had my favorite interface for setting up recordings and it has the nicest Guide function. It also seemed to have the most optional and customizable settings but, without a manual, some were hard to find and harder to know what they really did. In the end, I just could not get it to work properly and consistently. At times it worked, at other times it didn't. I ended up getting some messages about rasterizing and other oddities which other users complained about in the Beyond TV forums. I was not happy with how long it took to load the program at each startup of my computer. Also, I was unable to get any closed captioning operational, a critical function for me due to hearing loss. I found its screen sizing function pretty clunky and problematic as I switched between my HP monitor and a 42"" plasma TV. Regrettably, it just didn't work for me and I returned the product.I tried Sage TV on a 15-day free look. It had a wonderful PDF manual (253 pages). It also was deficient in closed captioning ability. It had a very nice screen sizing setup that worked much better than Beyond TV. Its screen was clean and it really looked good. It set up faster then Beyond TV but I had problems getting it to output consistently and properly when I switched between my HP monitor and my plasma TV. It seems to be very comprehensive.Media Center didn't work for me at all initially, which is why I tried the other two programs. After they frustrated me to death over four days of fooling with settings on video cards, tuner cards and displays, plus downloaded driver and software update issues, I used my new knowledge to search online for Media Center issues. I then discovered (silly me) that HDTV was supported by downloads (rollup versions) which I had not installed or known about in my first attempt to set it up. After the rollup download, Media Center set up easily and operated on both my HP monitor and my plasma TV, switching between them was just a matter of which screen I booted the program into. It also has closed captioning. The Guide is pretty good and everything works beautifully. I still like Beyond TV's interface better but this program is not giving me fits like the other two did, so it gets the overall win in my situation. The biggest plus for me is that Media Center has closed captioning. It is hard to see why the others don't have this function since the captioning is part of the video stream from broadcasters.Each program has pluses and minuses. My final coice, the Media Center, is based on its closed captioning, apparent stability in displays and its general functionality."
88488,1,"I own all three levels of this: Primary (for grades K-3), Intermediate (for grades 4-6), and Advanced (for grades 7-9).These are standardized tests which parents administer at home on the computer. They will measure your child's aptitude and performance in math, language arts, science, and social studies. They will also measure your child's IQ.These tests are not boring fill-in-the-bubble types of answer sheets. They have colorful graphics, unique characters which introduce each test, and music.You may use these with *all* your children, giving these cd-roms multiplied value; a one-time purchase of each level is all you need for all your kids.Please understand that, if you get test results you are unhappy with or don't agree with, there are many variables which could have contributed to those results. I've used these for several years; most years produce accurate results, but a couple of times the results were definitely *not* accurate. For example, one year my middle child's IQ tested at 79! This is slightly above retarted! I *knew* this was wrong. The instructions clearly state that this type of thing can happen; because of this, test results are best guaged over a couple of years (you may test your child every six months if you choose, except the IQ portion, which is tested only once per year).Your child needs to be able to use a mouse to use these tests properly. Mental illness or other states of mental or emotional disturbance will *not* be diagnosed with these tests.The cd-rom comes with a handbook for parents. It gives instructions for loading the program, using the program, how to read test results, description of the different tests, description of how the publisher developed the tests, FAQ, and troubleshooting. Please read the handbook thoroughly before administering the tests.I have been extremely pleased with these tests. You can choose to print a shortened version of the results, or a *very* detailed analysis of them. This feature is extremely helpful, especially the first few times you use them. I am surprised they aren't being published anymore, because they are well worth the retail price of ....These will operate on both the Windows and Mac platforms."

49920,0,"I am not sure what is all the excitement about Leopard...I love my MacBook Pro, but Tiger worked better for me. I have quite a stunning collection of desktop background pictures which are flipped every 1 min, it was never a problem on Tiger. On Leopard, every background cross-fade takes 60% of CPU, even freezing the UI momentarily, probably related to the [useless] menu transparency. My Mac is MBP with 2GB, the 2007 version of Core 2 Duo.Then, Finder crashed on me once already. iTunes too froze once, which never happened before.2 of my apps which I used every day (httpmail, Groupcal) no longer work.There are also problems with some apps that post modal dialogs (the dialogs appear behind the app window, effectively making the app unusable).Translucent menus don't work for me, I wish there was a way to disable it. I don't know how people can like this even bigger dock at the bottom, eating precious vertical screen space. I have my dock on the left, but it is now more transparent than it used to be on Tiger, and background creates a lot of visual noise. I understand new features (and even breaking backward compatibility) when they make sense going forward. But these menu gimmicks don't buy anything, and just about all users complained about them, so why Apple keeps them??Gee, the screen snapshots with green grass and glass dock sure look pretty, but put a few windows on the screen, and the dock will start getting into your eyes. I think Apple over-designed this one. IMHO Apple users love Macs for good (ergonomic) design, good performance, and clean (Unix-based) OS, not for screen gimmicks. If translucency is a selling vehicle, why not make it optional to please the hard core users.I am so disheartened, I think I am going back to Tiger. Silly me, I didn't do a backup..."

It is helping my kids, ages 11 and 12 1/2, really stay fresh on their math skills over the summer. It is challenging because as they complete one level/round, the math gets harder. They also have to carefully read and follow clues and have to think. No monkey see, monkey do, but really think. Absolutely recommend this to anyone whose kid needs fun with math to get them interested in math, keep skills fresh, or to stretch their thinking and knowledge. Best of all, my kids love playing it and will play this game above others."
54715,1,"I have read a gazzillion books, visited as many web sites and the guitar has always been a damn mystery to me. Sure I can bang out a few chords and play House of the Rising Sun, but that's about it. This program has clicked with me more than anything else I've ever tried. After about a month, I really feel like I can play the silly thing! Now I can go back and understand what all the other books were trying to tell me! Get this: I went into a guitar store and plugged in an expensive Strat and played it without feeling stupid!The approach appeals to my nonlinear thinking. You can work through the lessons, skip ahead and then go back. I won't say I've mastered anything yet, but I'm playing and enjoying! I'm recommending this to everyone! I if you can read tabs and understand basic open chords START with this program!

61121,1,"PROS: One of the best video sequencer, rendering and DVD authoring programs on the market.CONS: None really with the product it's self. I wish it could produce Flash videos though.OVERALL IMPRESSION:This review will help potential buyers of Ulead's Video Studio (Hence forth referred to as VS) understand this product and make sense of the contradicting comments on this review board.I have used several video editors over the last 13 years and though they all have their own pros and cons, VS is by far a better product.What must be first understood about the whole subject of Digital Video Rendering, is that it is the most complex and strenuous thing that you will ever do on your computer. No matter what kind of computer you own, editing and rendering video will push it to it's limits. PC's by their very nature are multi-task oriented machines. What this means is that they are designed to do several different types of work, like web browsing, typing, gaming, etc. In layman's terms, PC's are jacks-of-all-trades and masters of none. Most people have dozens of programs running in the background aside from the standard windows processes, all doing different task, like anti-virus, spyware protection, msn messenger, apple quicktime, AIM, AOL, so on and so forth. All these programs are using different resources on your PC and occasionally require the processors attention. Unless you have a multi core system, you only have one processor and no matter how fast it is, it can only do one thing at a time. Even in multi core systems having a bunch of programs running in the back ground can cause system lag during the rendering process. To make it clearer to understand, imagine you are taking and end of semester collage calculus exam, and you have 20 kids screaming at you wanting your attention. Now you understand what your processor feels like!The first thing you need to do before running VS or any other video editor or sequencer is dedicate your computer to nothing else but that. You can do this by clicking on the start menu and clicking on run (Win XP). In the Run dialog box type msconfig. The system configuration editor will come up from which you will choose ""Selective Startup"". Clear all the boxes except for the ""Load System Services"" box. Click OK and restart your computer. You just got rid of the 20 screaming kids. Those virtual screaming kids are what caused 98% of all the complaints found in this review board. The next thing you need to do is defragment your hard drive. You need to do this on a regular basis anyway, but it great to do it just before you do anything with video. If you have a large hard drive (which you should if your going to do serious video editing) defragmenting could take several hours in which you should leave your computer alone; so start it the night before and let it run all night.Good morning! Now your are ready to do video editing.First off, VS is primarily a video sequencer not an editor. Although version 10 has added some crud video editing functions (brighten, color tone etc.)it is still primarily a sequencer. VS is a sequencer which allows you to add video clips, images, graphics and sound together in your desired sequence. VS, is great at what it does. As far as sequencers go, VS gives you 10 times more control over your final product then any other product I have tried. All that control makes it a lot harder to understand then a program the uses a bunch of presets to do the job for you. Most people that have reviewed this product, have reviewed it as a whole, but that is not fair. I will review the individual aspects of the product for you to have a better idea of the program.One last thing I want to talk about before I issue my final review scores, is rendering. There were a lot of reviews that complained about how long rendering took. I also noticed that the same reviewers stated that the final video was of excellent quality. There was one reviewer that had tried some other programs that rendered much fast, but the final product was fuzzy and distorted. The simple truth about video rendering is that the longer it takes to render, the better the quality of video. Rendering time is also drastically effected by the build your overall system (CPU, RAM, Graphics Card etc.) and whether or not you have 20 virtual screaming kids in the background.Now for my final review. Scored 1 to 10 (10 being the highest)1. INTERFACE, Score 6: The interface borders on professional level, because there are so many customizable options. This can be confusing for new comers with little experience. Once you get use to the program though, you will find the interface mostly intuitive, but there is a lot of room for improvement.2. CAPTURE; Score 8: This is a hard one to rate because there are thousands of different capture devices and it is hard for any software developer to keep up with them all. VS will not work with most legacy devices. VS allows for RAW (or DV) capturing, which a lot of other programs don't. RAW is best if you want to produce a high quality DVD, but it takes up about 10GB for an hour of video.3. RENDERING; Score 10: There have been substantial improvements in this area. Version 10 is still slow, but faster then 9 was. It is also a lot more stable and crashes less then version 9. The quality of the final product is better as well. Most freeze ups with this program will occur during the rendering process, but these will be due to you not following the steps above to get your system ready to render video. It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you walk away from you computer and leave it alone during the rendering process. Don't even think of touching you computer while it is rendering. Doing so may cause it to freeze up. Multi core systems are more tolerant in this area then single core system, but it is still a good idea to walk away from your computer during the rendering process. It is always important to remember that computers are built by imperfect humans and are therefore imperfect. Sometimes you do everything right and bad things still happen. You just try again.4. OUPUT; Score 9: VS has preset for just about every standard output you can think of, and gives you configurations option (if you know how) to produce all the rest.5. DVD MENUS; Score 7: VS gives you a lot of options for creating nice menus and a nice assortment of ready made templates, but you have to have Ulead photo impact to edit the templates or create new custom template. Where this area really lacks is a save option. As stated multiple time on this review board, any changes you make to the timeline will result in you having to start the dvd menu from scratch. This can be a real bummer if you have a customized menu, but not that bad if you use the ready made templates.STILL IMAGE RENDERING: Score 10: This one area where version 10 really out shines version 9. In version 9 still images would come out grainy and pixelated. Not so with 10. I have produced many mixed video and still image DVDs with VS 10 and all I can say is WOW! The still images come out just as crisp and clear as the video.6. INCLUDED GRAPHICS: Score 10: VS come with the most extensive assortment of transitions, graphics, sounds, etc. of any other program. I am talking about professional level transitions and stuff. You will not be disappointed in this area.7. COMPARISON WITH ADOBE PREMIERE: You really cannot even compare the two because Premiere is a video editor and VS is a sequencer. Is Premier more powerful? Yes it is in some areas, but VS slaps it silly in other areas. First off Premiere and intuitive interface is an oxymoron. To even start using Premiere adequately you will have to go to school or spend months stumbling along. Second, you had better have one heck of a tweaked out computer before you even install it, or all of your hard work will end up in a freeze. Third, Premiere can only edit and sequence your video. It can render it, but only to a file on your computer. It cannot create DVD menus or burn it to your DVD or VCD disk. For that you will need separate Adobe DVD authoring program (where the heck did my $300 go?) The bottom line is, unless you need a video editor to enhance or repair the quality of your video, 99% of us do not need a program like Adobe Premiere. I spent the big buck to buy Premiere and it is just gathering dust.8. OVERALL IMPRESSION: If you are serious about producing nice DVD's, SVCDS and streaming web video, this is the program for you. I have produce DVD's with VS for public showings that many people have reviewed as bordering Hollywood quality. Can VS be improved? Name something that can't be improved.If you just want to make some streaming web videos for your blog or website, you can use this program but there are many free programs that can do that just as well.If you just want to copy old VHS tapes to DVD disk, buy a dual deck VHS/DVD-R combo unit at Wal-mart for $98 and save yourself a lot of time and trouble. Why stress your poor home computer out? Most of these combo units even have DVD menu and chapter options.I hope this review has helped you out."

57895,1,I have been doing my own taxes since 1953 including those for my electrical contracting business. I have taken numerous college level tax courses and at one time was a certified California tax preparer. For me Tax Cut is easy to work with and does it all very nicely with lots of good references. I stopped using Turbo Tax because the company got greedy.
56718,0,"I am sure a professional or one versed in color management issues can use this device and achieve good results. People just getting into this should be careful. I followed the instructions and now my monitor puts a definite blue cast to everything. So obviously, I did something wrong - but finding out what isn't easy. First, the on-screen help is a total joke, hardly has any info at all. There is no manual either. There is no explanation of color management, don't explain how it interacts with other devices, etc.I do have two monitors, one LCD, one tube. I was able to get it to do profiles for both by unplugging one and then the other. The two monitors aren't even close to showing the same colors now - one is blueish the other yellowish. So again, I'm doing something wrong, but the application gives me no clue on what to fix.The other apps are even less user-friendly. The profile chooser application has no on-screen help at all nor does it let you delete profiles.The included Pantone color picker application comes with a 20 page pdf that doesn't really explain what it is or why you'd use it.Again, someone coming from a graphics background probably won't have a problem and I'm not claiming the application itself is flawed. I may well come back 3 months from now and have no problems at all either. But you do need to have knowledge of color management to use and troubleshoot this."

The ones that are in this game are Peter Perfect, Gruesome Twosome, Sergent, Penelope Pitstop, Red Max, The Slag Brothers, and Dick Dastardly and his dog Muttley. Unfortulently, Dick Dastardly is not one of the racers you can choose from, but is in the races. There is a lot of tracks. There are shortcuts in most tracks. You can race in a singe race, a championship, or you can practice."
36565,1,"This box came with several games on seperate disks, so you choose if you want to install one or all of them. The games I liked were, Theme Hospital and Sim Safari. The rest of them you could take or leave. But for the price, it was worth it just for the two games alone. Sim Theme Park never did work, or I couldnt figure it out, but it didnt look good enough to worry about anyhow, especially after playing Roller Coaster Tycoon. Sim Life, Sim Earth, Pinball and Marbles just collect dust.Theme Hospital is a great game with hours of enjoyment, great graphics, and humourous diseases like The Squits, which sends the patient to the bathroom alot, and Sim Safari is really cool where you set up a Wild Life Safari and a camp, by hiring locals from the village. As long as you do good, the village thrives. Its alot of fun. I rate this four stars only because the rest of the games sucked, but thats just IMHO."
59320,1,"This product is great and delivery was quick as a bunny! My kids love it They are homeschooling so its great practice and a terrific teaching tool.

Respectfully, Mary H."
11970,1,"I've found Windows XP to be solid and dependable. It literally worked right out of the box (on multiple systems), with almost no disappointments (only one very old device didn't work...the new driver has yet to be made available). Two-factor authentication, Kerberos, IPSec, EFS, etc. all work like champs.There truly is a lot new in Windows XP. Here's some of what I like: Remote desktop, a stateful firewall, the Help and Support Center, text to speech, cipher /w, ipsecmon now being an mmc snap-in, the advanced attributes details button for encrypted files, using Media Player for dvds, etc! (...)If you don't like the new `look and feel' of XP, try classic mode."
59925,0,"I use FrontPage mainly for a page editing and design. Also, I've found a few of the other features helpful as well such as themes, shared borders and navigation bars. The guts of my site, however, rely heavily on cgi and various Perl modules. I have not had many conflicts with FrontPage until this latest version. I've experienced program freezes, unwanted file permission changes, unexpected theme changes and many other annoying bugs. For advanced users wanting to upgrade, I would suggest waiting until Microsoft has time to fix all the bugs in this version."
76791,1,I have found this to be a wonderful product. I can create all kinds of invitations and other stationary easily!
44031,1,I needed this for an online class I was taking ASAP. It arrived quickly and was priced well. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I had to go online and search for information on how to use some of the formatting in the new WORD. I wish the product had a manual included with it!
41427,1,"If you have a mac and want to edit sound of all kinds you will love this package. Sound Studio is agood name for the product. It does just about anything you could want. I even removed ""pop"" from old 78 rpm recordswithout the removal being noticeable."

58359,1,"It is true that your data or files are not completely deleted when you format your hard drive. You can actually retrieve some of the files or datas even in DOS-mode. But this WipeDrive 3.0 actually erases all the data in the hard drive. It is indeed impressive. Even so, because it meets the standard of Department of Defense (DoD).BUT, if you are a casual computer user, just want to sanitize and clean your hard-drive more than just a FORMAT level, you do not need this program. You can get FREE utility via download. Try free Active@KILLDISK version 3.0 (www.killdisk.com). But if you absolutely have to destroy all the data because of its sensitive materials, you should get this program. Note that FREE versions do not meet the DoD standard, however, it does more than regular FORMAT.In sum, WipeDrive 3.0 indeed does what it claims. BUT for casual users, FREE utility in the web is more than enough."
4188,1,I'm using these discussions to help me decide on purchasing Ghost 2003. What I need to do is change the old hard drive on my Notebook by moving the O/S and installed programs to new bootable hard drive. I would like to &quot;image&quot; or &quot;clone&quot; the Notebook's old drive over my home network to a new hard drive that is installed in an external enclosure and connected to a PC by USB or Fire Wire. I hope to end up with the new drive being an exact bootable copy of the old drive and to then install it in the Notebook. My 5 stars assumes that I can do this. I know that Ghost can &quot;image&quot; across a network to/from USB and Fire Wire but is the final restored/cloned drive bootable? Has anyone done this or is Ghost capable of doing this?

You have to play the mini games to win some of the toys and stuff. And there is a host character in every room you go to, (I THINK!). There is a temple scene, a haunted mansion scene, and a nursery where only pregnant mothers can go. The female adults can have 1-4 babyz at a time. Theres day and night cycles. And it can rain, snow, be sunny, or rainy out. I don't have the game, but thats what other people said the game have. I WANT TO ORDER IT FAST!!! IT sounds really fun! Theres five new breedz(border collie-papillion-pug--and two more that I forgot) Oh yes, I put 5 stars because IT sounds and looks really awesome!! I would suggest you buy this game!!! It sounds better then the SIMS UNLEASHED! PLUS NEW COOL CLOTHES in Petz 5!!!"
32240,0,I really can't review this product as i haven't bought it yet. I'm trying to decide which desktop publishing software to buy and the previous review sounds an awful lot like what's written on the back of the box and was absolutely no help at all.

If you need to send an MS Office 2007 and later document, MS Outlook XP can attach it without any problems.You may not be able to color code columns like MS Excel 2007 and later, but this version in the series works just as good without the extra bells and whistles.

11810,1,"This is the best Windows based drawing tool I've seen. The customizable stencils make it easy to create the tool that's perfect for your needs. However, the freehand capability leaves something to be desired as freeform lines can be quite difficult to work with. On the plus side, this tool provides a ton of really cool capabilities that you won't find anywhere else at the present time. It's a great product that just needs some fine tuning."
5612,1,"I go through a lot of kid software, and this is the funniest cleverest learning software I've ever seen. The box says ages 3 and up, but kids under 8 will definitely need an adult's help to figure it all out. Every age will like the great animation. BTW, this game runs native on Mac OS X."

I am a begginer at chess, but a friend of mine who has been in the game for more than 20 years found the program excellent. It is also very useful to have a good time playing chess against the computer which has been the only way I have used it. I would rate it 5 stars.F. Acevedo"

70148,1,"I bought one of these around Christmas time. I have Windows XP and on the back of the MP3 package there is a sticker that says ""it is not necessary to format the MP3 player with Windows XP"". Well in the instructions they tell you to format it for all other versions so I went ahead and formated. What they meant when they put that sticker ont he package was ""DO NOT FORMAT THE MP3 PLAYER IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS XP OR YOU WILL RUIN THE MP3 PLAYER"".I returned the original player and waited an entire MONTH. I now have tried it out and it's great!!! Very easy to use and to transfer files to. The sound is really good and as it claims there is no skipping. A great deal for the money. Earphones fit MY ears fine.Again, just be careful about formating.Oh, one final thing- IOMagic and Digital Research tech support is probably the worst I have ever dealt with so beware. I give the packaging/instructions 1 star, tech support a negative 1, and the product itself 5 stars."
4464,1,I didn't need all the functions provided in this software. The software is a vast improvement over previous versions. I many crop people out and put them in group photos. Great tool for that.

73218,1,"I bought the older version of Movie Magic Screenwriter 4.7 as a way to test the waters. This product worked perfectly right out of the box on my Mac computer. It has some amazing features even for it's age and the flexibility of writing a novel and a play has worked exactly as advertised. The index cards helps me to organize, reorganize and reorganize, until I get the story that's in my head into the logical order that I desire. The screenwriting software is excellent and helps me to write my plays faster and more accurately. The formatting is smooth and allows me to concentrate on the story while writing my screenplay, instead of concentrating on formatting the screen play properly. I was so impressed with the software that I ended up buying a newer version Movie Magic Screenwriter 6 for the added features and benefits of the newer software. Thank you for reading my review and happy writing."

59442,1,This game was an exciting way to try to figure out your way around problems. I thought it was a game you could learn from and a game for any kid. I thought it was a challenging and was a fun way to use stratagy.
56353,0,"Pros:The effect of real media is quite nice. The oil paints seem to work very well, and the ability to mix media digitally can create some interesting effects that aren't possible with traditional media.The brushes are numerous. Almost too many to wrap your head around. People tend to have a few favorites which suit their needs and stick with them.Cons:This software suffers from what I'd call Ghost in the Machine syndrome. During the work process these little things occur for no real reason and make it difficult to focus on your work flow. Often menu's will move, undock, or just go away for no real reason. I'd say at least once every two hours for no real reason I have to go to windows>arrange>Default to get everything back where it should be.Large brushes are laggy (anything over 200 size) even on my machine which has 4GB of ram and a 2.4Ghz C2D processor. Working at high resolution will slow down the machine considerably.Overall:It's great for practice and for enjoyment. Pretty great for concept and commercial art applications, but I wouldn't consider it a true substitute for traditional fine art painting."
24481,0,said it would work on vista well definately not to my satisfaction took hours to find a patch for it to work at all. Finally got it to work but some of the features are lost which is a shame. This is a wonderful game used to enjoy it on my xp thus wanted it for my vista it sits collecting dust due to the lost things for vista but I highly recommmend it for XP
10324,0,"My daughter is 3 1/2 and loves Dora. But this game is WAY too simple for her. There just aren't enough things to do, and even the higher levels don't really challenge compared to her two other games: Care Bears and Blue's Clues. If you have a two-year-old or a child who's never played on a computer, this is great at teaching basic color, shape & number recognition and how to use a mouse & click. A better choice for a 3 - 4 year old is Blue's ABC Time Activities."
46413,1,"GPS Compatibility...As advertised, TOPO! works well with GPS units. I use it with a Garmin Vista Cx GPS frequently. Other people's negative reviews concerning GPS compatibility probably stem from their assumption that they should be able to download the maps themselves to a GPS device. No, you can't do that with just TOPO.As advertised, you CAN download waypoints or routes before a trip, which becomes extremely helpful when you feel lost. And you CAN upload waypoints and tracks after a trip, which is very interesting to map where you've been.General Comments on the Software...This is an excellent product which I always use before going exploring or mountain climbing. I discover new features in the software all the time. I don't think the program has ever crashed on me, and it is not hard to learn. 5 stars!!"
36116,1,"What a great piece of software! It's simple to use and makes organization a breeze. You must use it to believe it. The adjustment portion of the software is basic, but that's all many will ever need. I use Photoshop 7.0 and can simply drag photos from Album into it after locating them.There's no more endless searching for photos.Look under the proper category or subcategory, or date, and Album will show you thumbnails of all that have been tagged.It's easy to tag them too.It may take a little time to tag your existing photos, if you have thousands as I do. But download your photos through Album and you will organize them as you go.It's one of the best buys I have seen in a long time. If you do digital, you need Adobe Photoshop Album."
92406,0,"There's something to be said about a movie that makes you cringe, laugh, or groan at the appropriate times. Monster-in-Law is one such film and that characteristic makes it stand out from many humdrum romantic comedies.The movie starts off by introducing the impeccably nice Charlie (Jennifer Lopez). I've always been fond of Jennifer Lopez' movies (with the possible exception of Gigli) and this role is one her less adventurous ones, nevertheless played just right. Charlie lives somewhere along the shores of what looks like Venice Beach (I'm not sure if this was specified but I just recognized the place). She's got the required gay best friend. She's a receptionist for a doctor, a dog-walker, aspiring artist, and all around good girl. And she's available. Come on. She sounds like she's having the toughest time getting a guy interested and while walking dogs along the beach she's being ignored by pretty much every guy that jogs by. Really, any guy who sees her doing what she does would gather the guts to at least smile or say hi. Anyway, one guy does (Michael Vartan) and in a series of coincidences would keep running into each other. Finally, they go out, fall in love, and the rest should be history.However, Viola (Jane Fonda, in a stunning return to the big screen after 15 years), Charlie's future mother-in-law, a proverbial Barbara Walters in the film's world who had just learned six months earlier that she would be replaced at the end of the season, and got sent to a wellness center when she flipped from the news, enters the fray. Viola, fresh from mental rehabilitation, clearly disagrees with Charlie and her son's wedding. ""My son, the brilliant surgeon, is marrying a temp!"" Or something like that.Viola's voice of reason yet slave to her insanity is her assistant (Wanda Sykes). She tries her best to curb Viola's plans to ruin the future nuptial only to be misinterpreted most of the time. What happens is a virtual war of the most estrogen levels that occurs completely unbeknownst to the groom. Really, the cruelty is outstanding! But all in all an entertaining experience.The expected happy ending happens way too easily for my taste. It's a point that would have been driven into any mother-in-law far earlier in the real world, in my opinion.The secondary characters are, while minor, not forgettable. That's one of this movie's best strengths. Every minor character has a face, a persona, and an importance, down to the waiter of a restaurant.Many critics disagree with the manner of Jane Fonda's return to the silver screen, but I for one feel she fits the role well and makes it work. A lesser actor would have been unintentionally laughable.It was pointed out to me during the movie that Jennifer Lopez and Micheal Vartan's ex-significant others were currently dating. Just an interesting food for thought.Overall, an entertaining flick for fun and laughs."
23369,1,If your small business needs a business plan for loan purposes this is great. Very concise and easy to use. I would recommend this to all sole proprietors.
78421,1,"Excellent, easy to use software. While easy to use, it is also full featured and works perfectly with my HP D5160 direct CD/DVD printer, which is why I bought it in the first place."
69817,1,"This really takes the stress out of driving in Europe. You miss a turn, it tells you how to recover, no matter what the one-way streets, etc. Worth every penny! Some inaccuracies with newer roads, but nothing that really interferes with its functionality. We used it very successfully in Italy and in Germany. Buy it if you're driving in unfamiliar areas."

71811,1,"I write this review given the price of the software, being a really new student in ASL only two weeks in actually. I got frustrated having to watch online videos to review the signs since the angles can be bad or the speed. This software is good for that allowing zoom in and out features. My friend who is teaching me also looked at this software and says it's pretty good and accurate. If I could say one thing about the software tho, is it doesn't explain theory or how to actually sign it, but than again low discs and sale value. This will more than likely not teach you ASL on it's own but, can be very useful with a class or with a book!"

29250,1,"I have used this on a number of machines and it is very effective. On one machine it found and eliminated 1400 ""pests"" as it refers to the spy ware. It is reasonably fast. Install is fairly easy BUT ->The scanner may not run the first time on some machines: this can be solved by running the program from the command line version. (This seems to create some file it needs to run). After running the CL version the desktop Icon version works perfectly every time. Sadly, the support staff does not know how to fix this or any other problem. They always respond by telling you to submit a bunch of difficult to collect log files. So would rate the help as zero stars.Once I got this running it works great. Updates are very frequently posted and often after an update a scan finds more pests. This catches many things that Window XP firewall and Norton antivirus miss. VERY worthwhile. If you are on dial-up the updates can take quite a while. Also the activity log does not work reliably but that is very minor. Be sure you are on-line when you install since it needs to run an update at install.It got 4 stars because of the tech support and first start up issue."
79331,1,"Every now and then a software program comes along that really grabs you. The kind of program that is intuitive, functional and fun to use. The latest update is a 'gotta have' item because you really want to see what improvements the developers have added this time. For myself, SmartDraw 2007 is one of those rare 'gotta have' programs.SmartDraw has always been a solid well-designed graphics program. With it you can create forms, calendars, fliers, certificates, flow charts, family trees, floor plans, landscapes, timelines and more. I have been using SmartDraw since version 4 and have worked with every version since then. Each upgrade has added new features and improvements. The latest creation from the folks at SmartDraw is version 8, christened SmartDraw 2007.The graphic and symbol libraries have been enhanced and expanded in this new version. They are high quality and professionally done. You get both blank templates and ready-made examples. All of these can be customized. The templates and examples give you plenty of ideas and cover most of what you would want to do. I would like to see templates for Avery labels added to this collection. I think this would be a nice addition to a great graphics collection.SmartDraw 2007 is fully integrated with Microsoft Office. Icons in the tool group allow you to export drawings with one click to Word, Excel or PowerPoint. Word and Excel also contain a SmartDraw icon that allows you to import SmartDraw projects. You can also save your work as an Adobe PDF file. This has allowed me to store and reprint my SmartDraw projects at work and share them with others.Unlike some software which has a steep learing curve because of its complexity, SmartDraw has gotten easier to use as the sophistication of the program's features have expanded. With SmartDraw 2007, the interface has been completely redesigned. The opening screen has two tabs; ""Open a New Document"" depicting a graphic listing of all your saved projects and a ""Create a New Document"". The new document screen is divided into three panels. The left side is set up similar to Windows Explorer and lists all the project types available. It also includes a Favorites folder and a search bar. A single mouse click on any topic brings up graphic examples for selection. Once a project is selected, it appears in the center panel work area. The left panel switches to contain related symbol libraries. More libraries can be added from the main collection, stacked in this area and opened as needed. A single mouse click selects the graphic. To place the selected graphic in your work, just move the mouse cursor (changed to a rubber stamp icon) where you want to insert the graphic and click. No more drag and drop, just point and stamp, pretty cool. Across the top of the screen are six tool groupings. These contain the appropriate menu commands and tools for the selected template. These are logical and functional groupings, the icons are familiar, no guess work is needed to figure out what each one does. There are forward and back buttons to switch screens as well as an undo icon.SmartHelp is located in the right hand panel. This is a wizard that guides you through your project from start to finish. Hyperlinks lead you to related topics for more information and the back button allows you to return to your project. I found SmartHelp to be an excellent way to work with the different templates. It is a great learning tool.Printing your projects is just as seamless and easy as all of the other features of this program. If your design is larger than one page, and you want to print on a single page, no problem. Just check the Print on One Page box and it is done. Print margins can be set to whatever you require. Projects that span several pages are printed with overlaps for easy assembly.Customer support is excellent. When I was using an older version of SmartDraw I had a problem converting some files into Adobe PDF format. I contacted technical support; they got right back to me with the solution to my problem. I feel that their customer support is built around the same user friendly philosophy as their software.Am I excited about SmartDraw? Definitely. After years of frustration trying to use other programs to do what SmartDraw does so easily, I thank the day I first tried this software. This one is a keeper."
62472,1,Very good program for work and home. You can transfer multiple address from excel sheets to program with one click of a button. Cut past from and to other programs. Would have been excellent if it had PDA capability with out any additional cost.
91682,0,"My 6 year old loves it, and for entertainment and educational value I would have given the product 4 stars. However, I was a bit shocked to realize I had to fork over more money so my child could continue past the first two sessions. Maybe it did say that on the box, but I missed that part. I paid the additional dues, and my son loves it. When I buy a child's software, though, I don't want to have to connect to the Internet to use it, or pay monthly fees to use it. I haven't yet experienced customer service like the others have."
44293,1,"I am a college student and I purchased this product due to the overwhelming need for it the previous year I attended school. My old laptop contained word perfect products which DO NOT comply with any of the files I need for school. This product is well worth the purchase and I found it cheapest here.

52223,1,"I recently had a worm on my computer and was forced to reformat my hard drive. After reformatting I realized that I could not find my old copy of Quicken 99 to reinstall. I'd used that program for the past few years for basic checkbook functions as well as credit card transactions. I use Quickbooks for all my higher end business accounting. Before automatically going to buy the program I checked some of the reviews here and I was really scared to try this product. But since I already had my old quicken 99 data backed up I thought I'd have to take a chance and try it. I have to say that I'm really glad that I did. One of the other reviews I read talked about not being able to enter hand written checks or not being able to enter a missed transaction in the middle of reconciling. Both of these are just not true. I've done both of these things the same way I did them in Quicken 99. If you need to enter a transaction in the middle of the reconcile process you just minimize the reconcile window and enter the transaction in the account, then restore the reconcile window. If you need to make a change to a transaction that's in the reconcile window, just double click on it. To me it's quite ""Intuitive"". As far as the review claiming you cannot enter handwritten checks, this is done the exact same as it was before. Just open the account register enter a date, enter a number, payee... etc.Don't get me wrong, I've had my beefs with Intuit products through my business. They do use their products to market other services. Even though this is a pain for the consumer, it is smart business practice. Their customer support ""is bad."" I've used it for the Quickbooks product I have and it's not pleasant. But this is BASIC personal finance software for ""a good price"" Even on the outside of the box, there's a list of all the functions the Quicken 2003 software family can do and only ""Track your checkbook & spending"" is highlighted for the basic version. So they are being honest from the beginning. If you want software that tracks investments or does business functions this is not the software for you. If you want to keep track of your checkbook, bills and credit cards it seems to do it quite well."
73022,1,I use this program along with my etx70at to plan my observations and use it to find the perfect aligning star. I also just like to go back in time or forward to watch an eclipse of the sun. This program is very useful and you'll be out for many hours ovserving celestial bodies.
30958,1,"I've had this program for a few weeks and it delivers excatly what itpromises. After fightning with crappy programs like Pinnacle Studio 9& 10 for the last few years this program is like a Godsend. If you'reused to Pinnacle systems,there is a slight learning curve, but the time spent getting to know this software is well worth it. True Ulead doesn't have nearly as many special effects as Pinnacle, but Ulead doesn't crash your system every ten minutes like Pinnacle Studios.Ulead VideoStudio 11 Plus is a straight forward video editing program and it kicks butt!"
30730,1,I ordered the Mother Goose Golden Book for my extremely active 2 year old. He is very interested in books and the computer. The only problem is he doesn't know how to use the computer appropriately. For this item he didn't have to. The book is read to him. The best part is he sits and listens instead of banging on the keyboard. He can even recite some of the lines.
27522,1,"This is the first Nancy Drew game and is still my favorite (nearly tied with Treasure in the Royal Tower). Here's a breakdown of what I thought:Graphics: Not the best compared to later ND games, but still pretty good. Bad voice acting, but seriously, who is focusing on that while trying to solve a mystery? The theatre (where it takes place) is very beautiful and well presented.Plot: This is probably my favorite ND game plot. I find the usual sabotage boring and so a kidnapping was a breath of fresh air. It kept you on your toes and made sense.Characters: The characters were pretty great, too. They were a good mix of personalities. Some you liked and some you despised. And you can talk to them throughout the mystery unlike some other ND games where they have nothing to say as you near the end of the game.Setting: The theatre, like I said, is very beautiful and bright and also kind of creepy because of its shabbiness (and probably because of the creepy kidnapping). There was quite a lot of rooms to explore and so you didn't just reach a dead end at the end of the game.Puzzles: I found them not too hard, not too easy. There weren't as many puzzles as some other ND games. This game was more into the character interaction which I like.Ending: Suspensful ending. It was timed and so it did add a bit of stress. No big puzzle, more like a few strategies.Overall: It could be very well the fact that it was my first ND game and so it's close to my heart, but I absolutely love this game and really recommend it."
23202,0,"I don't think there is easy accounting software, but this is probably the best for the buck. True to Quicken Style there is always something else to buy. We Bought Quick books and Payroll and it does a pretty good job.Cons: Amazon took 2 weeks to even box & ship. Payroll only supports forms for federal reporting you are asked to buy an up-grade to get the state forms for reports. We thought that was cheezy."

8000,0,"A happy ending to a rocky start - At long last and sooner then I had ever expected, on 2-11-2008, Apple released the 10.5.2 update for Leopard. I eagerly downloaded and installed it and was delighted to find that the CS3 issues are resolved and in fact, it seems CS3 PS and Bridge as well as other apps I am using on Leopard seem to load much faster. Some of the other quirks other users have reported like the Mac Mail app hanging or not shutting down (and that I also experienced), now appear to be fixed as well. Finally the stability that I always had in Tiger now seems consistent as well in Leopard. At this time, I'm definitely going to keep my Leopard software rather then return it.10.5.2 Info and installation details of the update are here at this Apple link:[...]-------------------------------------------------------------------------We've purchased our 3 Macs (Mac Pro, Mac Mini and MacBook) from Amazon and all had Tiger OS X installed. Tiger has been bug free on all of these system s with few updates or fixes ever being needed to be downloaded. I use Photoshop CS3/Mac on my Mac Pro. We just recently decided to give Leopard a go and purchased the 5 system family pack. I chose to use my Mac Pro as the first system for upgrade. Well, unfortunately and only after installing Leopard did I realize there exists some major issues using PS CS3 within the Leopard OS. There is a known issue with most all of the tools in CS3 when using Leopard and a lot of instability when entering numerical values for crop as well as many other CS3 tools. After seeing this and doing some web research, it seems that Adobe and Apple are working on a fix ASAP which will be in the next upcoming update for Leopard (referred to as 10.5.2). In fact I know only too late that Apple plans over 150 ""fixes"" to the existing bugs in its latest OS with the Photoshop CS3 being only one of them. My rating is less about the new features in Leopard and more due to having taken the plunge into what I thought would be a safe and stable new OS for the MAC only to find that the most often used piece of software I use almost daily, limps badly in the new OS. Shame Apple for releasing Leopard either too soon and perhaps without having fully tested it on some of the most often used software on the Mac, and CS2/CS3 on a Mac should have been a super high priority. We'll be returning our DVD of Leopard to Amazon and for the meantime, staying with good ol' stable Tiger until we see what owners are saying about the ""fixed"" issues, later this year. This is certainly no fault of Amazon's, but, buyers need to be aware of this issue, especially those who depend on using Adobe and other SW products on their Mac! By the way, all of our Macs were purchased from Amazon since they beat the best price out there and using our Amazon PRIME account, we got our systems either in 2 days with FREE shipping or in one case, overnight for just $3.99. If you routinely shop at Amazon and want free 2 day shipping from Amazon, Go PRIME! They have never failed us yet on an order and we do a lot of shopping there. Well done Amazon!"

4961,0,I had a problem uninstalling Norton Internet Security 2003 so I had to contact Symantec. The only two choices were to call an 800 # that costs $29.95 or a 900 # that cost $2.95 a minute I took the gamble that my problem could be solved in less than 10 minutes to save money. Luckily it only took 3 minutes but still cost me almost $10.What a racket. On principal alone I will not be purchasing a product from Symantec again.
3012,1,"OK, its an accordion file and they supply the labels. But for folks like me who keep all their receipts and other papers in one big messy bin, this accordion file is very useful. It helps you to get all the right papers sorted out, has neat little labels, and keep the papers together. You can pull just the papers you need out of that bin for tax time, and leave the rest in the bin for later.And getting it for free, hey, I am not complaining!"
14597,1,"As a first time web creator, FRONTPAGE 2002 helped me get my website up and running very quickly. Having used other Microsoft products at home and at the office (i.e. Word, Excel), most of the buttons and commands were very familiar to me, and will probably be for anyone who buys it.FRONTPAGE won't teach you concepts of web design or help you design a page that will translate into all the different screen resolutions and browsers out there - learning that, for me, came later. I had to simply get my web page UP.I was a BEGINNER at web design, and shelling out $400 for DREAMWEAVER didn't seem practical (or affordable). I must admit that having learned a lot about web pages, I'm thinking about DREAMWEAVER now!FRONTPAGE allowed me to realize my ideas quickly and easily. The WYSIWYG interface (&quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot;) is invaluable to people like me who hardly knew any HTML tags, and didn't understand the difference between Netscape or Internet Explorer.I pubish my web using yahoo as a host, and the interface between the server and FRONTPAGE is very easy. I click &quot;publish&quot; and the files load. Very simple.I really don't have a lot of complaints about FRONTPAGE. Now that I've become more functional as a webmaster, I am starting to understand HTML code and scripts - sometimes I don't even use the WYSIWYG screen, I click on the HTML screen and work &quot;behind the scenes&quot;.I reccommend FRONTPAGE for any beginners out there. It's an intuitive, easy to use program that doesn't cost an arm and a leg to get into.Good luck, future webmasters!"

63152,1,"Poser 5 is an incredibly impressive piece of software. I'd highly recommend it. Easily a five star!Poser 5 is a full blown 3D character animation system. It includes hundreds of 3D figures that are ready to pose and animate. Poser makes this process so simple it&iexcl;s used by lots of university programs that teach computer animation. There&iexcl;s an automatic walk generator, tons of clothes libraries, lights, cameras, props, hand poses, and figures poses.Poser seems to be a two headed wonder. It has the program side, very friendly, very easy to master, very inviting to use. And it has the content side, all kinds of high resolution virtual 3D characters. It has a full family of humans, named after the family in &iexcl;Lost in Space&iexcl;- cute touch. The figures have full facial expressions, can open their mouths, they have blinking eyes and even little wrinkles when they smile or squint. The adult figures can in two varieties. Pre-clothed and nude. The nude adult figures are anatomically correct in every detail. Every detail works just as expected, and they look, well, very hot!So far in my review, this is about the same magic mix as what was in Poser&iexcl;s previous versions ----Note- I bought an upgrade from Poser 4 with Pro Pack and then bought a second copy for work via Amazon.com, I both teach 3D animation at night and create 3D animation and illustrations with Poser 5 for an advertising agency during the day---But what&iexcl;s new in Poser 5 is nothing short of amazing.Poser 5 includes real 3D hair that flows and can even be blown around by a wind generator. I use some very expensive hair tools at the school; and Poser 5 makes growing and controlling hair simple. It also includes a full cloth engine, so I can drape tablecloths or hang curtains in 3D scene, or make my female figure&iexcl;s dress blow and sway as she walks. There&iexcl;s also a powerful face room tool that allows the base figures in Poser 5 to look like anyone. I imported two photographs of my wife and in ten minutes created a virtual character that looked just like her for a science fiction illustration project.My favorite part of Poser 5 though is the new renderer. It&iexcl;s the same rendering technology as was used to make Toy Story, Monsters Inc. and Final Fantasy. The quality does require more time than the box stock Poser 4 renderer, but the good folks at Curious Labs left the old &iexcl;P4 renderer&iexcl; in Poser 5. So you can choose between decent quality, really fast, and amazing quality with a little more time.Another note- I just finished a technical 3D character animation for a client that took a few days to completely compose, layout and render in Poser 5; we billed the time to the tune of several thousand dollars for the project. That&iexcl;s a great return on the investment in Poser 5. And because it&iexcl;s Poser, even though I am an illustrator by trade, I can do full blown animation projects.Let&iexcl;s talk about Curious Labs support- unlocking the program took less than fifteen seconds. I unlocked it on a second machine, they DO allow that, the one serial number you buy just can&iexcl;t run at the same time on two machines, a simple fix, unplug the second machine from the network. Even so, I bought the second copy so I could legally run two copies of Poser 5 at the same time. I have ethics about software; don&iexcl;t like the bad karma of trying to scam two copies, if I need to use it twice at the same time, I&iexcl;ll pay for a second copy.Another issue on support, I sent an email to their service person, she a rock star! I got a reply in a few hours. Not some automated reply, but from a real person. And my upgrade order question was answered right away.A final point in the support issue. Curious Labs has released one Poser 5 patch already, and a second one is on it&iexcl;s way according to email I got from Curious Labs today. They are truly dedicated to Poser and seem to genuinely be in love with this product.Well, that makes two of us. I love Poser 5 as well. It&iexcl;s aworld changing program that lets you feel creative again. I&iexcl;ve seen great comic books done with Poser, illustrations in National Geographic magazine, Maxim magazine, Poser animations are on MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1, on the Oxygen TV network, they were used in the Matrix, The One, Fast and Furious and in my new favorite movie Moulin Rouge (check out the DVD behind the scenes) Poser is being used everywhere and anywhere you need a &iexcl;virtual actor&iexcl; to create a 3D scene.My recommendation, I said it at the beginning, I&iexcl;ll say it again. Poser 5 is an incredibly impressive piece of software. Easily a five star!A quick edit- I am not an employee of the company that makes Poser, I've had great results so far using Poser 5 and expressed those sentiments. With the newest updaters that Curious Labs is giving away on their website they've added stability and even a new atmospheric lighting feature. I stand by my review- 5 stars for features and value."

57288,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

89625,0,"I would not recommend this OS despite using it at work for almost a year without a BSOD. It is unsuitable for home computing, and is a disaster to upgrade from Win 98SE. My attempt to do this resulted in a long list of incompatible software, hardware and drivers. The upgrade got 15 minutes in and stalled. OpenGL is not supported and is is very bland and lacking in features. If you are running a PC with low RAM (eg 128) Win 2k will really struggle. It is suitable for a small business network where the owner is trying to sidestep paying Microsoft for several copies and activations of XP. For a fresh install and with the right spec machine it is undoubtedly hugely more stable than 9x versions (you get crashes, but they don't crash the whole OS). However XP is out and is a far superior OS in all cases."
62373,0,"Based on the other reviews, I bought PC Relocator UltraControl. After installing, I realized that to have a smooth relocation that you need to plan, plan, and plan. Your old PC needs to be well organized too. Because of various reasons, my old PC's two hard drives were partitioned into several partitions. Programs were not installed on the C drive with the OS and PC Relocator did not like this. Relocator puts each of the partitions in separate folders on the new PC drive if you do not have exactly the same drive configuration on the new PC. Of course the programs did not work properly on the new PC after the relocation since they were not in the correct location so I un-did the relocation, manually installed most of my programs on the new PC, and then re-did the relocation. A number of shareware and freeware programs could not be relocated. Another quirk is that while the program was collecting data on the old PC, I started the process on the new PC and I kept getting an error that said that it could not find my old PC on the network. I checked all connections and confirmed that I could communicate to the old PC through the LAN. I discovered that I had to wait for the old PC to finish collecting data. PC Relocator does move some information which was helpful but I expected it to be complete and simple. I spent about 16 hours getting the relocation to work right and to get the new PC set up after the relocation."

I wrote an email to TOPO asking how to correct this problem and they indicated that I could buy the expansion pack for the State series for about $20 and then it would work with my GPS reciever. So I went to their website to buy the expansion pack and it was priced at 24.95, and it is not availabe at this time.

It could be that my microphone and/or sound care is deficient, but I find myself having to ""train"" the program to recognize many words and commands. Once it's trained it's okay, but one must be prepaed to have a lot of patience with this program. Other than that, the program is okay and very useful."

These are truly &quot;Edutainment&quot;. Games that just happen to teach at the same time. My daughter loves them and with their help is reading at a fourth grade level - and she's in 1st grade. All the games in the Blaster series keep the same recognizable characters. All have great songs that the kids love.A++ In my book!"

43000,1,"I purchased the Mictosoft Office 2007 (Student) for an on-line degree course. I have found it easy to use and since the university is using the same software I can easily open the documents and power points they provide to me. I know some of my classmates have had trouble submitting documents that the school can open, I haven't had any problems in this area. After reading previous reviews, I was concerned about using the tool bar but the icons are easy to find and use. I would recommend this software to any student."

21856,1,"It could have been a little more intuitive for those of us who don't want to sit down and read the THICK 300 page manual.The interface is also filled with uncommon methods of navigation and graphic manipulation.

13089,1,"I have been using Turbo Tax products for the past 3 years. Unfortunately it has not improved in terms of help interface but it does what it is supposed to do. Briefly the pros / cons ::-PROS ::1) Transfer Tax Return information from previous year. Don't have to re-enter personal information SSN, DOB, existing dependent dtls etc.2) Updates Tax forms each time you start TurboTax to edit your return.3) Includes new rules related to Cash Donations for Tsunami Relief i.e. Taxpayers can elect to deduct for 2004, money donations made to qualified charitable organizations through January 31, 20054) Includes State and Local General Sales Tax Deduction details ( new in 2004 )5) Provides ( for exp.) Income Summary or Deduction summary comparison for the past 2 year -- to give an idea about the changes over the past 2 years. One columns shows 2003 numbers while the second column is for 2004.6) Also likes the ""Your Bottom Line"" summary page which shows the complete Tax picture comparison for the past 2 years.7) Audit Alert section seems to be comprehensive.8) Also provide the ability to directly update the forms -- you can complete hide the forms if you want.9) The only marketing pitch that I saw was related to ItsDeductible and the option to have the filing review by Tax Consultants.CONS ::1) Help can be improved a lot more.2) There was no way to go back to the summary screen that I mentioned in the PROs section.3) e-Filing rebate -- just pay it if it is a valid tax return which was electronically filed. Can't be any sane reason to have customers fill up rebate forms when TurboxTax is the one confirming our online tax filing status.Will recommend this product to other buyers."
46602,1,"This piece of software is what I have been hoping for for since I bought my machine. It is the most elegant and detailed mapping system that I have used. With the Garmin Vista Cx it works flawlessly. You can download any or all of the map data from the disks into the ""Topo"" file and it runs very well on my powerbook G4. It will upload all waypoints, and routes. It will download all waypoints, routes and tracks! The maps are gorgeous! The interactive web feature is cool but young. It has a geocaching feature. The 3d maps are sweet! It downloads updates and new map layers almost perfectly (had to manually download the software update). I only wish that waypoints symbols would transfer to and from my unit but I can easily live without them. Load the Mapsource maps to your device (Garmin ""x"" series saves to swappable memory microSD cards) and use Topo! from your laptop."
28015,1,"After several OSX upgrades on my G4 and never having run this software, even though I wasn't experiencing a disk crash or any problems, I decided to give it a try anyway. (I had purchased this to have on hand as cheap insurance in case of later problems).After running it, I was surprised at how much faster my computer seemed to run. The fact that it optimizes the directories rather than just patch them probably has something to do with it. At any rate, everything seems quicker now and given that, I believe this product is worth the money. Not only can it fix a corrupt disk, but it can tune your disk so that it operates more efficiently even if you aren't experiencing problems yet."
27985,1,"This product is a good follow on to Guitar Coach. Both products follow what I call a building blocks approach to learning. Everything you need to learn to play a piece of music is there for you in great detail and each block or section of training builds on previous blocks.Most guitar tapes, videos and CDs have mostly old songs that are nice (and probably public domain, so the producer of the training material doesn't have to pay royalties to use the songs), but they do get a little old after awhile. Not so with Guitar Coach or Intermediate Guitar Coach. Both have recent songs that sound good and are fun to play.I have Guitar Coach and Intermediate Guitar coach and find both to be excellent learning tools. I have several video lessons, and a shelves full of books on how to play guitar. I have found that I am making the most progress with Charanga's Guitar Coach and Intermediate Guitar Coach CDs over everything else I've tried, not to mention I'm having a lot of fun in the process!Thanks to Charanga for making such a fantastic product!"

35712,1,"This product makes it very easy to learn Chinese. I have tried Pimsleur, but I found it very difficult because it was audio only. Also Pimsleur was a bit boring at times. I also am using Teach Yourself Beginner's Chinese but it is not as good as this. I thought the product was quite overpriced, especially since there is this ridiculous Amazon Policy of not selling Fluenz to Australian addresses, and therefore I couldn't get the discount, but I now think it was worth the money (Amazon should sell to O/S though).The audio CD that comes with it refers to additional podcasts available as downloads from www.fluenz.com, but when I visit the website, I can't seem to locate them. However, putting in www.fluenz.com/podcasts will find them, there are 15 about 10 mins each.They r gr8.There is one negative and that is the safedisc 4.85.000 copy protection. This means that you can't back up the disk in case of damage. I understand that they want to protect their work, but I should be entitled to make one backup copy. I want to do my fluenz at home and at work too, I am not willing to take a $300 disk and carry it around on a daily basis risking loss or damage. This would have been quite anxiety-making if it had not been for the good people on the internet who have discovered a way to circumvent safedisc 4.85, so now I can use it at home and work too without worrying, but the time taken to learn how to do this would have been better spent learning Chinese.I like the slow pace of the lessons, but I think at the end you will only know a couple of hundred words at the most. Also, my chinese friend seems to think it has some examples of incorrect usage, he objected to using the measure word ge with shu eg zhe ge shu, he said NO, that should be zhe ben shu.I would like to see the following improvements:1. A plan for registered users to get a replacement dvd for a very small charge if theirs gets damaged2. A Mandarin 3-4, this course is great, but I'm sure I am going to want more, I am completing it very quickly at the moment. I dont think enough vocabulary is taught.3. A version that works on any WM5 pocket PC with a virtual keyboard, not just smartphones with physical keyboards4. An upgrade policy so that if you purchased the windows version and then got a mobile device, you could upgrade to purchase the mobile version, provided you had already purchased the Windows version5. Only correct usage, eg. not using the ge measure word if it is incorrect."
46712,1,"This is a 'must have' software if you hike, bike and recreate outdoors. The software interface takes a bit of getting use to, but once mastered it provides simple navigation and a lot of information. I do a lot of mountain biking in Northern California and this software lets you 'preview' a trail by mapping it (you draw a line on the trail) and the software then calculates distance travelled and the cumulative vertical ascent. This is very helpful in determining how long a ride will take, and how much physical exertion will be required. It also helps you to track your condition level - as you get in better shape you will be able to do more vertical in less time ...Once you have created a route you can send it (via e-mail) to friends, or post it on the Topo website to share with others. Other neat features are a 3 dimensional viewing package (sold separately fo $20) and the ablity to send waypoints to handheld GPS units.There really aren't any 'cons' to the software. Some things you should be aware of though are that Garmin (maker of many handheld GPS units) promotes its own topographical software. This is a pain because Garmin only allows you to send waypoints form the 'Topo' software and you can't upload the detailed maps into the handheld GPS unit. I own an Extrex Vista and the inability to load maps without buying the Garmin software is an irratant. The only other comment is that some of the maps in the software are dated so they don't always show the latest information in terms of roads and buildings. This you just get used to. Similar to other posts - When hiking or biking in remote areas don't rely on a handheld GPS exclusively, bring a printed map, and have some familiarity with a compass and know generally the area into which you are going - also let other people know where you are going (send an e-mail of your route ...). This is common sense that will save a lot of headache.Overall this software is 'a good thing' and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy spending time outside, and it is particularly good for the mountain biking community."

3526,1,"Prior to being able to judge most aspects of this software fairly, it is my opinion you MUST fulfill the following requirements:1) FIRST REQUIREMENT: Minimum system requirements - A Celeron 1.60 Ghz (or comparable) with 512 mg RAM will escort you with tolerable ease throughout most of the programs AFTER you have downloaded the FULL SYSTEM UPDATE PATCH of 101 MG on the Nero website and NOT BEFORE. Pentium 4 and above with 1 GIG memory is really where you should be to enjoy without restraints. If you're anywhere below 1.60 Ghz and are doing something like 256 MG RAM with considerable RAM absorption already, this bullet is too big for your gun. Upgrade your system or settle for less.2) SECOND REQUIREMENT: As stated above, download the FULL SYSTEM UPDATE PATCH of 101 MG on the Nero website and RESTART your machine as required. PLEASE NOTE: A NEW patch that has release date of December 22, 2005 is what you will get - this is a GOOD PATCH. Remember - A lot of heavy duty software repair is going on during this patch process so my advice is to download the 101 + MB UPDATE PATCH by going to the website and choosing ""Nero 7"" then ""Update"" then save the file to your hard drive. Prior to unleashing this 'update' UNPLUG yourself from the net, disable all anti-virus and security software which by its nosy nature can disrupt and corrupt the flow of a good repair. Remember - it doesn't take but 1 spoiled file - dll or otherwise - out of thousands to create an Achilles Heel in the repair patch, so optimize your chance for success and keep the pathway smooth - make your anti-virus and security software stand down until the process has been completed.OPTION - ONLY if you know what you're doing - you may wish to check out your start-up programs by doing a Run Command: msconfig - check out the programs in your Startup menu - you may have several programs in start up (hogging memory) that you can disable using Selective Startup options which will free up more RAM and facilitate Nero 7 - BUT don't touch it if this is a strange concept to you.If your first impulse is to ditch this software and write a negative review, chances are you're suffering from having not met the (my personal) aforementioned requirements. I think most users who DO meet the requirements and download the latest patch (which incidentally will have better and better successors) will be sufficiently pleased with NERO 7 to consider it the BEST THING YET.The Nero team has in fact done their homework - that they chose to move this racehorse out on the track whilst it's legs were still young is no big mystery and should not be regarded in a less than exultant light. This is YOUR racehorse so LEARN how to ride it - understand how it ticks, explore the myriad of available options and you will win your share of the races.PLEASE NOTE: NERO 7 represents a paradigm shift away from singular thinking and into turn-key product. There's something in the 14 plus packages for everyone. The BACKUP program is excellent - it has an option to display individual files which exceeds some of the top backup programs out there.Nero 7 is your software space shuttle for the 21st Century..and sure it's a little buggy - what space shuttle isn't? So, you can either get in and take a trip to technical outer space where all the action is or you can whine and moan and wait for the bus. Which will it be?Please Note: If you opt for the bus, pack your lunch and be patient. I hear Roxio is runnin' slow."
49454,0,"I don't mean this in a bad way at all! Customers should never buy a operating system software until the Developer's have ironed out at least the majior problems. When one purchases a newly released operating system product the customer becomes the real true Quaility-Control group for the big Corporations. If you are a novice, beginer, etc. WAIT!!!! For the developer to clean-up the unexpected driver, software compatability problems. Other than that Windows Vista is a wonderful product and after you iron out all the kinks...the Vista product is a wonderful tool for Companies and small businesses, and home use alike. Overall it is a good product."
38895,1,The product was in good condition when it was delivered. The software was up to Microsoft's standards. The shipment arrived in a very timely manner.
53268,0,"Overall this is a decent product. The bundle with the GPS is great and affordable. After using it in the car for a few days I can see the advantage of a wireless GPS receiver. When it's time to replace this one I'll look for a receiver that does not need a cord attached to my laptop.The software has some great features, and also a few huge gaps. It's easy to get going, and generally does a good job of mapping routes and managing the display. However, I was astounded to see that fuel stops could not be managed in this software. The program implies that this can be done, but the estimates don't take into account you may get gas earlier or later than recommended. You essentially have to manage gas stops manually and outside of the program, which is a glaring omission.Another disappointment was the inability to easily determine the distance from your current position to a point on the map. The directions window will show you the distance to your next stop, but it should be easy to find the distance between your current location and any point on your route, or between any two points. I found it hard to believe that this capability wasn't in the software, but it isn't.The final issue is the same installation problem that others have found. Microsoft really needs to fix this. It's completely unacceptable that software and the bundled hardware simply do not work after installation and require independent troubleshooting on another web site to resolve. There is no mention of the installation issue anywhere on Microsoft's web site."

2942,0,"EXPERIENCE:I suppose knowing my experience may help to gauge my ability to use the program and help you to decide what you are capable of doing if you purchase this program. I have worked with computers for nearly 20 years. I am a professional graphic designer and web developer. So, I suppose my experience with software would be in the advanced category. However I have never used this program prior to my purchase, but have used other home design and 3D software in my past.PROS:Great 3-D walk-through. Fairly descent selection of colors, materials, indoor, and outdoor furniture and landscape design elements. Fun to use if you don't need any custom items that are not in their library. I liked the ability to design more then just the floor plan, such as lighting, deck, plumbing, etc.CONS:3D tools seemed to be difficult for the average user. My expectations were not set high, as this is supposed to be a consumer-based product, thus it should be fairly easy to use with direction from the manual. However it lost me! It was several days getting the hang of using it and I still couldn't get basic items designed properly. For example, I needed to create an L-shaped island with sink for the kitchen. It just was not an easy thing to do. Because they did not have such things in their library, I was forced to use the 3D tools (designing from scratch). When creating the object dimensions, it is not easy placing the shape in it's proper location, and it was difficult to get the elevations correct as well. Try putting one of their sinks in your own 3D designed countertop, it just doesn't work well at all! It was truly more work then it should have taken for such a common task. Same thing when applying materials such as wood choices to furniture (albeit furniture was not real important for me) it took much more work then what should be considered a basic task (too many pieces to color within one furniture element). The roof never got quite finished either. I could not get the walls to fit within the dimensions of the roof (or visa-versa) on a 2nd story. I tried so hard, but not being an architect or engineer, I would say that this task requires you to really know what you are doing. It was not discussed well in the manual either. So, was it me, or was it the software with the limitations, I really couldn't tell you.Needless to say, I got a bit frustrated, and hopefully without sounding like a know-it-all, frustration just doesn't happen to me very often when it comes to design programs. Don't get me wrong, I had those days back when I was learning to use design software, but using a consumer-based program such as this should have been simple for someone with my design background. I don't believe though, that it had to do with being easy or difficult, as much as it had to do with the limitations of the program in my circumstance. But for the newbie, I believe it would be considered a difficult program to use.MY ADVICE:If you really need something that covers a lot of ground, but doesn't require a complex design, or complex elements, then this should be fine. However if you don't have the patience or time, and you want to add more custom features to your project, I believe this program is overpriced for your needs, as it will prove to be more work then you bargained for. In fact, although I'm sure they put a lot of money into developing this program, I think it is overpriced for the average consumer trying to design their new home or remodel."
70579,1,"I don't understand why people are having issues with the program unless they are not uninstalling all protective software first (anti-virus, anti-spyware, and Fire walls) Warning if you have Norton products download the free Norton removal program just search on Google (symnrt) download it and run it than all Norton products will be removed any that don't uninstall can be removed safely from the add remove program that windows has. Restart the pc and than install the program. do a full update using live update and restart after doing that the program should have no flaws. Now on to the pc i put it on to prove that yes it runs on slow and old systems. I have a laptop with a centrino processor running at 1.7 ghz 512 mb of ram 80 gig 5200 rpm hard drive and to test the capability while scanning i ran the cleanup wizard and the anti-virus scans at the same time while playing solitaire the system manager while these were going on didn't rise above 90% and the scanners changed speed to accommodate each other. As for my tech skills I work in a IT dept that services customers computers for a large retail and I feel confident on recommending this product for vista along with trend micro pccillin. Now to those who read the negative reviews and are getting vista do not buy McAfee because it is not certified for vista the only two anti virus companies that have received certification is Norton and Trend Micro because McAfee is not certified it is not guaranteed to protect your system. If you want to see a list of certified programs go to Microsofts website and search for vista compatibility and they have a list that they have certified and one that is compatible but might have issues use this site before buying security programs for Vista"

You cannot just look up the value of items without entering them in a donation table. There is no back button either, so if you make a mistake, oh well. Finally, when it prints out it does not give you the price. You can only see that price in the online display, so you have to write out the dollar amounts in yourself for your records.

Although I'm now 35, I decided to purchase a few and see how I liked them (I figured that if they were too ""childish"" for me, I could always give them to my niece...). However, that was not to happen, as I absolutely love playing them!One of the best features of these games is that there's several levels to choose from - beginner to expert - and this will allow you to decide just how hard you want the game to be. The difference between the levels is the number & type of hints you get along the way.This particular game is one of my favorites. It was actually quite difficult, and so I found it to be a wonderful challenge. The graphics are excellent, and you really get that mysterious feeling as you traverse this old, spooky castle.If you liked reading Nancy Drew, you'll absolutely love playing these games! They are great for kids and adults alike. However, regardless of your age, if you haven't played too many Nancy Drew games, I'd recommend that you go with the beginner level for this game - if not, you may get frustrated quite easily."

89541,0,"The 2000 Pro is NOT for everyone. Games will not run well, older programs will not run well, and the system uses so much memory that you'll have RAM to run FEW things at once.I setup dual boot and compared both OS very well. 2K is more stable, but 98 SE runs fine if you are not installing and uninstalling programs everyday, or every week, or putting DEMOS to run. If you install and remove programs your registry gets damage and the 98 SE does not run well, and most likely crashes all the time.I'll remain with 98 SE."

Checksoft, you have to click ""new"", and either tab or use your mouse to get to the fields you need. MM, was just straight forward, Check #, date, to who, amount/either transaction or deposit, if want to put something in the memo, enter... To edit in MM same thing, just go in and edit. You don't have to hit a ""edit"" button, just edit..Checksoft is a nice program, it keeps my checkbook balanced, but I wouldn't buy it again or recommend it..."

85985,0,"After reading the reviews, I knew the installation process was going to be lengthy. Okay, I got that. What I couldn't stand was they had absolutely no tutorial for the product. I consider myself to be somewhat savvy when it comes to figuring out how to work programs, but this was ridiculous. It took hours just to figure out the basics. Maybe they expect you to have already purchased their maps before. Once I have figured out how to navigate my way through the basics, yes they give good directions and are accurate. It's just hard to get past the fact that they told tell you how to use it."
64990,1,"I bought The Glass Eye a few years ago just as I was getting ready to retire from a position as Systems Manager for CADD equipment (Computer Aided Design and Drafting). As a Systems Manager, I had more than fifteen years of experience managing, drawing, and teaching CADD in two different companies. I had been designing and drawing stained glass layouts using a variety of drawing packages. I have been working with stained glass for almost thirty years and have been selling my work, seriously, for about six years.With The Glass Eye, I was amazed at how quickly I could put a design together. I was able to easily put any type of picture (or piece of a picture) into a bitmap background, draw the lead/foil lines over it to create my stained glass drawing, then scale it to the size I wanted, and print out my patterns. This was a simple, quick way to create my own custom designs. I used The Glass Eye for about a year and a half, until Glass Eye 2000 became available.As soon as I read about the new features, I was ready to purchase the Professional Version without even trying it. But, I downloaded the trial version. After just a few days, I ordered the Professional Version. I was happy with The Glass Eye. I am ecstatic with Glass Eye 2000.The best new feature, in my opinion, is the glass library. With it, I can choose manufactures' colors (with catalog number) and paint my design with streakies, waterglass, textures, etc. I have actual glass samples which I purchased from the glass manufacturers and the library takes a lot of guesswork out of how the glass will actually look in the finished project. I also like the new text writing feature and the fact that the individual pieces of glass in my design are numbered for me. To be able to email a drawing (in .JPG or other format) to a customer is a definite plus. And to be able to pull a picture into the background in a format other than bitmap (such as .JPG or from my scanner or digital camera) saves a lot of manipulation of file types.Glass Eye 2000 is a very professional, easy to use, product and is essential for anyone interested in doing serious design work. Because it is designed specifically for stained glass use, it is far superior to any other drawing software package. Whoever designed it really did their homework! (And I have had enough experience with other products to know what I'm talking about!!)I teach beginner's stained glass in an adult education course and highly recommend Glass Eye 2000 (the Standard and Professional versions) to all of my students as a potential future tool for them to purchase.From Sunny Sandock Stained Glass, Littleton, MA"
83065,1,"Because this is an upgrade, most users will be familiar with the product.My complaint is that, while it comes with 90 days of support, by the time it is delivered and installed, you only get about 60 days of support. Learning this software is like trying to get a PhD in Astro Physics and the training is outrageously expensive. The difference between 90 days support and 60 days is probably worth 6 or 7 hundred dollars. It's like the old ad for Listerine. I hate it but I use it.----"

80301,0,"Even though I downloaded the trial version first before I purchased the Auralia Student Edition 3.0, I still wasn't well aware of the full extent as to how useful and effective the software performs/is.I was not completely satisfied with the product due to the following reasons:1. Auralia is helpful for musicians as a supplemental tool, but not effective in teaching music hearing to novices.2. The software contains topics which require singing into a microphone (for pitch exercises), and tapping on keyboard (for rhythm exercises). For singing into a microphone, the Auralia system doesn't take-in the pitches accurately sometimes. Also, there is a short time delay in tapping the rhythms via keyboard or clicking the mouse.Overall, I still think Auralia is a great software, it's just that personally I was disappointed in its functions and performance."

80820,1,"During my six years administering a Microsoft Exchange e-mail server, TrendMicro's ScanMail for Microsoft Exchange saved my butt several times. While sites that ran Symantec (Norton) or other products either got hit because Symantec was late in getting new definitions out to detect a new virus, or were forced to shut down their servers until then, my server stayed up and came through unscathed.Trend easily beats the rest of the crowd when it comes to response time to new virus outbreaks, and 99.9% of the time their new definitions actually do the job.I used to run Symantec Anti-Virus at home, but, after seeing just how well ScanMail for Exchange performed at work, finally decided to switch and bought PC-cillin Internet Security 2005.No regrets so far whatsoever. PC-cillin is very easy to install and extremely flexible to manage. My system is clean and trouble-free (and, yes, I have tested some other vendor's online anti-virus scans and have yet to see any of them detect anything that PC-cillin missed).Keep in mind, however, that *no* anti-virus software is capable of overcoming end-user stupidity. Be sure to set your virus definition updates to run frequently (mine is set to check every hour; yeah, I'm admittedly a little paranoid). Periodically check your virus definition dates against the latest posted dates on the vendor's website (TrendMicro makes this easy, as it's posted on their main web page). Practice safe computer use: don't open e-mail attachments unless you absolutely know who they are from and what they are; don't download programs off the web unless you have full trust in their source; don't blow off your annual virus definition subscription renewal when it comes due (I guarantee you will regret it sooner or later).Oh, and even if you are signed up with AOL or some other service that provides ""free"" anti-virus detention/protection, you would *still* be wise to invest in stand-alone anti-virus software. Corporations run anti-virus scanning at several levels on their network (firewall, file server, e-mail server, desktop, etc.), just to be safe. You should, too."
543,1,I find this product indespensible. I am able to sync all my computers anywhere I have internet access. It is a good value for the price.
41148,1,"Of the entire suite I predominantly use Designer, the fonts, and the clip art. I found Designer much easier to use than Adobe Illustrator. I currently use both, but greatly prefer Designer. The fonts and clip art are great. I was very impressed by the Media Guide which has thumbnails of all the clip art which consists of some very good design work and the alphabets of the fonts. The Media Guide is very useful for browsing through the available clip art and fonts. The tutorials in the learning guide for Designer are great and they make it very easy to learn. I have used it for everything from redesigning new office layouts to database manual creation, to logo design. The 3D program is also pretty cool and easy to use. As with most 3D programs it takes a while to render the graphics and you can end up with some pretty big files if you are making 3D movies. For simple 3D projects it works faster though. I dont use Picture Publisher only because I have several years of experience with Photoshop and use that instead. I own Micrografx Graphics Suite 2 and purchased it for $60 and it has proved an amazing deal. Even at $200 I would highly recommend it as a great value no matter your skill level - the learning guide will get you going fast and there's always great clip art if you want ready made graphics. In addition, you will save money on purchasing additional sofware books that you usually need because most &quot;comes with the software&quot; manuals are horrible instruction guides. Especially if you need a vector graphics program and don't know how to use one yet, this will work well for you."

49934,0,"I've been using OS X since the first beta version. For years I still used OS 9 for many tasks. 10.4 Tiger was finally a great OS X delivering huge improvements in terms of speed and stability. Prior to using 10.5 I was using 10.4.10.Installing:Installation experiences will vary but remember to always BACK UP YOUR DATA.I did not have a bad experience during installation, but many users had a very tough time with Leopard. This even made the news, and Apple acknowledged that they had a problem. More information can be found at Apple's own discussion boards, Fortune/CNNs blogs, and another good source of information is MacFixIt.One recommendation in order to avoid potential problems is to do an ""Archive and Install"" installation. I chose this option, and got some error message at the end of the installation. I was able to restart and Leopard was working, but none of my settings had been preserved. The Migration Assistant was useless in this case, since importing my data was impossible. According to the program I needed a lot more disk space. Based on my hard drive's size this did not make much sense.I proceeded to restore the backup I made prior to upgrading using Prosoft's Drive Genius. I then did an ""Upgrade"" install which is not the one recommended with Leopard 10.5 but it worked for me.I think that this is the longest I've spent on upgrading OS X. So my experience was not a smooth one, but also not a nightmare.New (old) features:I love Apple, but each year I'm less of a ""fan."" With 10.4 Apple gave us Spotlight and Dashboard. Interestingly they did not give users an easy way to disable these features. Since the pre-OS X days a thing I loved about the Mac experience was the level of individual customization I had as a user. Apple offers great computers and a superb OS, but other developers often offer superior products when it comes to software. Sadly the superior software can't compete with Apple. In the past we had Audion (vs iTunes), Watson (vs Sherlock), and with 10.4 Dashboard looked very similar to Konfabulator, which is now called Yahoo! Widgets.Some of the new features that are great for boosting my productivity include:-Quick Look. Similar to what Path Finder and WorkStrip have offered for years. It's great to have this functionality as part of the OS.-Spaces. I used CodeTek VirtualDesktopPro in the past, and there are a few other programs that enable the user to have multiple desktops. Again, great to see this as part of the OS.-Time Machine. I don't think I'll ever use this. May be good for people who would not make a backup otherwise, but it seems a bit inconvenient for my needs. I prefer other backup programs, as well as programs which can ""clone"" my hard drive so that my information is backed up and the hard drive is bootable.-Stacks. I don't use the Dock. Stacks gives me another reason to avoid the Dock. It's a shame that WorkStrip is no longer being developed. Their ""dock"" is really a productivity enhancer, well designed, with a lot of functionality and power.User experience:I don't use Dashboard or Spotlight. (Houdah Spot is a much better interface for using Spotlight, for example).I also don't use the Dock, Mail, or Safari. Apparently Apple has improved these applications/features in 10.5. I know many users who don't know that there are alternatives and use whatever Apple gives them. I'm not one of those users so I can't elaborate on those programs.I prefer functionality over Eye Candy. Visually I don't like many aspects of the new interface. This is not really a big deal. What is a BIG deal is that some applications will not work under 10.5. Apple does not provide developers with the final version of the OS until it is actually made public. That means a delay of days or weeks or months before some software is Leopard-ready. In some cases the software will never be compatible with 10.5. There are also a few issues with Java under 10.5.CHECK FOR SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY BEFORE UPGRADING.Conclusion:Overall I am underwhelmed with Leopard. Does it add anything significant that I didn't have with 10.4.10? Not really. As I mentioned before I already had a lot of the functionality I'm interested in by using shareware programs such as Path Finder, WorkStrip, FileBuddy, Houdah Spot, etc.It is not a bad OS. For many users the 300+ new features may be worth it.My advice is to wait a couple of weeks, wait for Apple to release upgrades and fixes, and give time to developers to address Leopard compatibility. Then decide whether Leopard is worth it for you. No sense in upgrading and finding out you can't run your programs, particularly if you use your Mac for work.Even though people are rating reviews that criticize Apple as not helpful, there is a lot of good information on those reviews. In addition to the aforementioned websites, also check VersionTracker and MacUpdate for user reviews."

65944,1,"First for Mac users: I installed this on a Mac running OS X 10.3. It asked me which version of OS X I was running and offered 10.2, 10.3, and 10.4 as options. I selected 10.3 and it went through a preliminary install. Then it asked for the serial number on the card which came with the software. (If you are as compulsive about throwing away clutter as I am, try to restrain yourself and save that card! Otherwise, I don't think the program will turn on.) After I did this and provided the usual registration stuff, it got online (I should mention I was installing in an administrator mode)and had a chat with the company. Everything went very well. This program is native for the Mac OS X and doesn't require Mac Classic or anything like that. Thanks, guys, for making such a neat piece of software that also runs on Macs!OK, now about using the program. I am the sort of person who gets a great idea and sits down at her computer and just starts going. Things go wonderfully for about five chapters, and then I run out of steam because I just haven't thought enough about where things are going, and it's getting hard to keep everything straight.This program is like sitting down with a no-nonsense writing teacher who asks detailed questions about characters, motivations, goals, and so on and gives you feedback on whether or not you have enough information for a workable plot stucture and what's missing. (You are free, of course, to ignore its advice.)The most difficult part about using this program is that the designers have invented a lot of terminology that you have to understand to use the program properly. (There is a PDF file on the disk containing a 300-plus page book that explains the theory and vocabulary in detail. I strongly recommend you read it first! Once you have that, the software is quite user-friendly.)What I found especially helpful in the software were the dozens of examples of well-known stories that the authors had analyzed in terms of their model of plot design. That model(this is oversimplified) is the idea that a story is like a mind trying to solve a problem and that different characters are like aspects of that mind at work.If you put in the work -- and it is a LOT of work -- at the end you will have a detailed plot outline which can be printed out.If you can write novel-length fiction on pure inspiration, you will probably hate this. If you have good ideas, but find yourself lost in the woods and hoping for a rescue party after about fifty pages, this can be a lifesaver. You get out of it as much as you put into it."

70388,1,"I am an adult that wants to learn how to read regular music notation and hear the difference between the beat and tempo. This program can do that. It is easy and fun for children from about 6 to 96 years of age! I am 49 and having a blast with it. I play several bluegrass instruments but have always used ""TAB"" to play the instruments. I recently started playing a new instrument whose usual music is written in standard notation. That is why I wanted to learn. But I found so many of the programs out there to be either beneath my level or really above it. I guess most teachers think someone my age should known something about standard written music. I do not have anyone close by and available on my limited time schedule to learn from, so that is why I choose to learn from software.This program is fun for adults too. It is a quality in depth program that assumes you know nothing about music and takes you on a magic ride from the very beginning teaching the staff, the notes, notations and everything else. It has a game at the end of each of the chapters and believe me some of the games are hard to get correct-particualarly the ones dealing with starting on the beat.For my money it can't be beat!"

762,0,"Although QuarkXpress 5.0 delivers everything its previous version offers, frankly, it doesn't offer enough in addition to these things to merit a $900 upgrade. In fact, this new version has some very serious drawbacks--namely, it is not native to OS X, meaning it has to run in the sometimes choppy ""Classic"" system. This leads to major refresh problems that can be quite a hassle. In addition, some of the things that have always bothered me about Quark--the necessity of clipping paths, making images transparent, etc.--are still there. I'm actually in the process of switching over to Adobe InDesign, which fixes all these problems AND is native to OSX. Until Quark comes out with a patch or an upgrade that will make their program native to OSX, pass on buying this upgrade, which offers little for the extremely high price."

How could they put something on the market that doesn't even work? And even though I ""uninstall"" it, I can see that it has not totally let go of my computer.

77756,0,"I've been designing with DW for a while now. The 2004 upgrade remains essentially the same, except for a few changes:[1] The default is now CSS. If you want a tables based layout, you can still work with it but a change needs to be made in the preferences.[2] The previous Dreamweaver MX supported CSS-P to a degree but editing it wasn't always easy. MM were obviously aware of Dreamweaver's rendering problems and for the new version, have borrowed upon Opera's rendering engine to do some of the hard work and it's now several magnitudes better.[3] Secure FTP built in[4] Microsoft Word and Excel copy and paste. Earlier version would lose the formatting when text was pasted inside DW. In this sense, DW now equals Frontpage[5] On-the-fly cross-browser compatibility checking[6] Some simple image editing like cropping and tonal adjustments without leaving the programAll this is fine and dandy, some of these features are also a god-send, but the CSS handling is a bit quirky yet. Surely, there must be a simpler and more intuitive way to do all this? There's far too much jumping around the interface required. Instead of providing one really inspired WYSIWYG way to do things, it seems to offer a multiplicity of mediocre alternatives, almost as if the programmers couldn't make their minds up and say, 'Hell, we'll put it all in'. That is a recipe for camels, not thoroughbred racehorses.If you know your way around Dreamweaver already, you might welcome the new CSS editing facilities but 50% of the full price for an upgrade seems grossly excessive. I'm a bit disappointed that after all this time, Macromedia have produced something that is okay, but not great.Besides, in the rush for an upgrade (now that GoLive is getting its own feet too) MM seems to have settled for some degree of bloat. My DW updated to 2004 MX is even more of a RAM hog than before.Net net: I'd wait for the next version upgrade, by when hopefully MM would have tied in all these loose ends."

For $...this product can't be beaten and I am amazed that it is so inexpensive. Don't be afraid to buy this, in my opinion I really see no reason why anyone would be disapointed with this."
19071,1,"This chip was absolutely worth it's weight in gold. Actually, more than that. We would have been hopelessly lost on numerous occasions without the GPS, and the European chip was phenominal. If you put in shortest distance for a route, this guy will take you over hill and dale and on roads only barely wide enough for a small car, so it's best to use fastest route or, as we did, put in towns that are near to your present location and a road that you wish to travel. We also used the GPS while walking, and it worked flawlessly. I will never travel again without the GPS. Friends that we visited in Germany were awed by the accuracy of the GPS and are going to buy one."

Expand full reviewSummary: We have had this SBS 2003 Standard for almost 5 years now. You might want to read the full summary to get the full sense of this product.There was a time, in the beginning, when I was totally frustrated with it because I rebuilt the entire system on two different boxes and it kept shutting down with no clues as to what is causing it. Finally, with just blind luck, I stumbled on to the fact that it was a badly designed instant messaging server (a third party software) that I was using. Got rid of it immediately. And since then ... No problems.It has since been a work horse of a product. I'm running it on a Dell PowerEdge 2800 with 4GB of RAM (recently upgraded from 2GB) and two Xeon 2.8 GHz processors.The best part is that it is providing the following services to our small business, without any problem (knock on wood; hard), for the past several years:1. File Server (Serving up almost half a million files to main office, two remote offices, 8 field personnel via vpn)2. Print Server (Serving up 4 heavily used printers)3. DNS Server (Primary DNS Server for the entire organization)4. DHCP Server (Heavily used with lots of reservations)5. Terminal Server (Admin only)6. VPN Server (PPTP; Up to 10 people are connected at any given time)7. Instant Messaging Server (Using OpenFire Server now)8. Backup Server (Backup Exec 11.5d; Backup broken down into segments to allow completion over a week and then repeats).9. Exchange Server (25 mailboxes heavily used)10. Anti Virus Server (25 User AVG Business Security Edition; Virus updates distributed via server)11. Two multi-terabyte external drives connected for data management use12. File sharing with clients via SSL protected third party software13. Running license server software for three different products14. Quickbooks database server15. Active Directory Server with AD tapped into by various other devices like routers and other server software16. Web server for OWA only17. Workstation Audit (third party software running on server)18. Dell Server Management Software Running19. Large format scanner control software running20. VNC Repeater21. Running 8 SCSI discs with three RAID volumes22. Still manages to run desktop software to create disk catalogs and Firefox for downloads; IE security is set to tight and I like to keep it that way23. and last but not least by any means; version control server via Shadow CopiesAll this is on top of the fact that it is backward compatible with most older windows server software and it will happily take the new ones too.Yeah, I have bashed Microsoft at times too but you know what? Their products speak for themselves.I for one have had an awesome experience with this one server alone and I have setup numerous in the past 20 years including hundreds of workstations. I won't go into details of other products in the interest of keeping this review about SBS 2003 only.Thanks for reading.P.S. Just noticed that the title of the product says 5 clients but obviously we have had to add CALs to bring it up to 25 users. SBS 2003 makes it very easy to add and/or manage CALs as well. Another plus."

At times, I felt as if I was really there. I really loved it when I found a blue or red page, that meant I was closer to solving the mysteries. At times I got frustrated, but that's all part of the fun. The best island I think was the one in the book hidden in the ship. I am really looking forward to Riven!!!"

43204,1,"I had to buy this product when my old computer crashed - it's finally an upgrade that makes it simpler to use. I read reviews that didn't like the new ""ribbon"" format - I like it a lot. I like not having to use drop down boxes for everything. Some of you younger people need to get out of your rut and learn something new. I also am finding new uses for the ""one-note program"" every time I use it - I especially like the one-button approach to saving pages from the internet to ""one note""."

I note that in some forums Expression Web users are experiencing the same problem."
9162,0,"I was surprised by some of the reviews. I have used both version 3 and version 2 (offered here) on my Explorist without a problem. It appears from the Magellan web site that version 2 is the only software being offered at this time and I know that some users prefer version 2 to version 3. Version 3 did have better support for geocaching, but other than that, I am not sure that I noticed much of a difference.To use this with the Explorist, you do have to go through extra steps, saving it to the hard disk and then transferring it over to the unit.At one time, Magellan stated that there would be yearly updates. Hardly. This version is long overdue for one. And since the Explorist does not support automatic re-routing, the mapping is more cumbersome than the Garmins. Although this has gotten me where I need to go, if I am driving somewhere I generally pull out the Garmin. There are tricks out there that eliminate the need to always have the cd in the drive when it is used."
81061,0,"I bought and used this Europe City Navigator from Garmin recently (in early jan 2009) during a trip to Nothern Spain and it was dissapointing for an SD Card that costs more than US$ 100....It didn't have enough detailed information on favorites and/or points of interest...Finding restaurants that are supossed to be famous by Travel Review Magazines was not easy...and also very slow finding satellites when turning ON.Definitively, not worth the money I paid for these maps.Jose Manuel ...."

59612,1,"This has Norton AntiVirus, Utilities, CleanSweep, and Web Services for Windows 2000, NT, Me, 98, and 95. [This was the last version for Win95.] The ""User's Guide"" has 13 chapters in 3 sections to describe the applications. Chapters 8 and 9 only apply to the ""Professional Edition"". Chapter 1 tells how to install NSW. You must first uninstall any previous version of Norton Utilities, Norton Crashguard, CleanSweep, Norton AntiVirus, or any other antivirus program on your system (p.15). You should create the Emergency disks on a different computer, one that has no problems. You can run the Emergency Disks after booting from the CD.Chapter 2 introduces the programs and their features. WinDoctor can remove the error that comes from trying to load a now missing program. Disk Doctor checks the integrity of your hard drive. System Doctor monitors and analyzes various parts of your computer. System Information provides detailed information about your computer. File Compare examines the differences between two versions of a file. Norton Diagnostics provides a complete hardware checkup to identify problems quickly. NAV protects and detects harmful viruses. CleanSweep manages programs on your computer (p.35). Chapter 3 tells how to create rescue disks with critical information about your computer; it needs updating to match your configuration. Chapter 4 explains how to respond to Norton System Works alerts. Chapter 5 discusses the use of Norton Utilities to solve computer problems. This is the most important chapter in normal operations.Chapter 6 explains the types of viruses and how NAV protects against them. It tells how to maintain full-time protection. Norton CleanSweep can clean out unused files (Fast & Safe Cleanup), such as Internet buildup, browser cache, and unused programs (Uninstall Wizard). The Backup Wizard creates a compressed backup file of a program. The Move Wizard moves a program to another drive or folder on the same computer. Chapter 8 explains how to use WinFax Basic; it allows your computer to send and receive facsimile transmissions (with a suitable modem). Norton Ghost creates disk images (Chapter 9). It can clone an entire disk, one or more partitions, and create image files.Section 3 covers problems and emergency procedures. These apply to Windows 95, 98, and Me. Flow charts describe the operations (Chapter 10). Chapter 11 describes emergency procedures; this is the most detailed chapter. You should read all these pages and take notes. They recommend unerasing files, testing for disk problems, and creating and maintaining a Rescue Disk set. Chapter 12 tells what to do when a virus is found; there are three types of alerts. If an infected file cannot be repaired it can be quarantined or deleted. Troubleshooting the most frequent problems is covered in Chapter 13. [I hope you never have to use Section 3.]"
77809,1,"Does exactly what it's supposed to. Some complain of a steep learning curve - I watched their online tutorials before starting, and it was pretty easy. Captures sharp-looking video from my Sony MiniDV camcorder via IEEE1394. I can edit all my clips together, insert titles, voice-over track, scene transition effects and burn a DVD with menu, all just with mouse clicks. Hasn't crashed yet. My only complaint is that the controls for tweaking the audio levels on the main video track are very fiddly, and the user guide is a bit sparse on exactly how this aspect is supposed to work."

58394,1,"Overall I like version 3.0. It doesn't have 12x12 templates (that I've been able to find) and the clip art are beyond cheesy. I've only done a few pages so far, but I think they look pretty real to life - with embelishments like staples and ribbon/buttons, etc and the ability to double mat my pictures like I was doing before. I'm sure once I learn the product better I'll be able to scrapbook much faster too!"
44716,1,"Like others, I've happily used Relocator Version 4.0 and then upgraded to 6.0. It is tricky to use, but it is the only Relocator that will transferapplications (executables). This function is a must have for me. It did not work the first time and you may need a few attempts. I recommend these steps:1) First uninstall and delete as many unwanted files and programs from your old PC as you can. I.e., if you're old PC is filled with a lot of junk that you've collected over the years, get rid of it first.2) If you are transferring to a brand new PC, turn off the automatic Windows update function. I.e., do not download and install Window updates until after the transfer.3) Skip the PC Relocator online update step.4) Do not manually copy files from your old PC to the new PC before using AlohaBob. (AlohaBob may mess up if it finds the same file on both PC's)5) Carefully follow all the directions that come with this product, do not skip any steps."
5986,0,"Like everyone else I switched from TurboTax because of all the negative comments. I had no trouble importing my TurboTax files. Then I simply followed the interview questions and before I knew it I was done. My taxes are not complicated at all so maybe everyone that is having problems is due to a more complex tax situation. But for a basic tax return TaxCut worked fine, but I still like TurboTax better so let's hope that Intuit listens to us for next year."

Good concept, but they could have done a better job with the content. More stories or activities would be nice."

29580,1,"We are a homeschooling family. I bought this game along with the fourth grade and fifth grade versions for my nine year old. She sailed through the other two, but found this one challenging. It is great for reinforcing math, introduces chemistry, addresses the pollution problem, history, spelling, vocabulary and reading comprehension. There is a level selection area in which you can choose how hard or easy the game is, but this is also handy for letting parents know where your child may need some help in or where they excel. It has a practice mode where the child can just do the activities without having to play the game. I found this great for reinforcing some of those areas my daughter needed more help in.Even though my daughter has finished all three games, she still plays these."
71283,0,"Basically an excellent program but with some irritating faults. The help menu is fragmented and unco-ordinated and it does have difficulty opening some MS documents. The biggest fault, I find, is that with labels it truncates the right hand row so that only half the labels are usable without a lot of adjusting. You can look in Page Preview for a label and all is correct but on printing all the right hand lettering is missing, also it sometimes insists on printing registration marks in the middle of the label, seemingly at random. Otherwise, excellent incorporation of spreadsheets into documents and very easy to use with excellent HTML editing."

16868,1,"This is a great a game! It's almost as fun as the actual board game. The only drawbacks, especially from the original Risk computer game is that you can't save the game and finish it later, and you can't play with a neutral player like the board game and the earlier computer game could. Also, sometimes the computer just makes some really stupid moves! But then again sometimes I'd swear that the digital dice were sometimes stacked against me! Fun game!"

The requirements stated the system was compatable with windows xp, guess it wasn't. Needless to say our children will lose out on the possible full potential of the system. However of the cd roms that do work are very enjoyable for our family to work with."
73629,1,"If you're reading this. You are thinking about dropping some serious cash so I will try and help you out!If you're trying to decide between this, which is Adobe production studio premium or the Standard Edition do not buy The Standard Edition, you get so much more with this version, I repeat do not buy the Standard Edition.You're probably interested in getting the Adobe production studio premium edition. I have to tell you, this is a great product, the dynamic link is such an amazing feature a links together. Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe encore, seamlessly. You can take Adobe After Effects compositions into premiere Pro without rendering. Then if you need to edit the composition you just pop back into after effects, tweak it adjust it pop back into premiere and is automatically updated. It is just an amazing thing to see it in action.After effects has got a total facelift, along with encore audition and premiere Pro. Gone is the ""palette-tosis"" of the old programs. Where you would lose palettes have palettes on top of palettes not know where to find a palette. The new facelift is totally awesome.Stability: I've been using these programs for few days, and they are totally stable. One crash, I think I had and I think was my fault. Adobe encore, I feel is the best improvements from the old version making a DVD with the new flowchart is so amazingly simple.Adobe After Effects 7.0after effects is the bomb is you such an amazing program. Once you get past the user interface and learn some of the nuances you can do almost anything and mean anything with video is awesome. 7.0 has the ton of user presets. The text effects are great. The backgrounds that you can create that come as presets, all editable. A cool thing is with a new user presets, you can see them actually preview and Adobe Bridge. This is cool!Adobe Premiere Pro 2.0this program now is more in line with user interface from premiere elements. The one thing I really enjoy now about from your Pro 2.0. Is that I can import MPEG files from my replay TV and edit them. This is something that was sorely lacking in from your Pro 1.5 user interfaces been revamped in the new style. He just feels a lot cleaner smoother and more stable.Adobe audition 2.0this program, I think has gotten the most drastic user interface upgrade. I'm not really in the audio is what don't really know what under the hood is changed. I do know it's got ASIO drivers now. That is a big deal if you're an audio. But now the user interface is more in line with all the other a video products. Was nice about audition now is that if you have a audiophile in premiere Pro 2.0. You can now send it to audition, change it or modify it save it and it brings it back right into premiere. No reimporting, that is so cool.Adobe encore 2.0if you're wondering about Adobe encore this upgrade is nice. The automatic slideshow creator, while only limited to 99 photos per slideshow is a nice feature. I'd use it already. There are some limitations in the slideshow creator like again, only 99 photos per slideshow but you could link unlimited slideshows back to back to back, but you're still limited to 99. In each slideshow. Stability I feel in this program is vastly improved the old encore. I was so like I was teetering on the edge of losing my whole project. I feel of it safer and encore 2.0. It has a ton more templates is integration with Adobe Photoshop and with Adobe After effects is amazing. You will love it!Adobe Bridge 1.0this program is quirky. It crashed about 20 times. It has the potential to be really great, but it's good takes a more time to get there. Building of this program as your media manager. Again, it's not there yet. I'm still using Adobe Photoshop elements, the tagging portion to organize my digital photographs.Adobe dynamic linkthis program really isn't a program, but it is a program. If you know and mean? Basically dynamic link links together all of the applications in the production studio. Now the hitch is you can't get this if you buy the program separately. So to see it in action, you have to buy the production studio. Another reason why you should invest. But once you have it up and running. You will be amazed. It simplifies workflow drastically one place all this in action I bought it enough said.So there you have it my micromini review of Adobe production studio premium. Something to keep in mind, this does come with a disk of totaltraining that reviews each of the programs give you some of the new features it about two hours. Not really great but it's free. When you install it the first time. You wanna register online seeing a free plug-in are a couple templates that they offer you if you miss this opportunity the first time you install it. You will not get another chance I believe, so make sure you register.This install comes on five DVDs income of five gigs of loops for Adobe audition, a bunch of DVD templates, and other goodies.Another thing to note, you will not be old to upgrade individual programs. Once you buy the production studio. So this means that if a new version of Photoshop CS3 comes out. You will have to wait to upgrade the production studio. You can't upgrade individual products. This kind of rots but I guess you gotta deal.This does have online activationThat's all I can think of at the moment, if I think of anything more. I'll update this review. Go to Adobe's web site and download the program demos. The one thing you won't get is dynamic link so you'll have to use your imagination and see how it will fit in. Also check out the creative cow (dot) com.With the production studio, you also get Adobe Photoshop CS2 in Adobe Illustrator CS2. That is a huge bonus.Have some fun and get it done"

62537,1,"I buy ENCARTA every year, and BRITANNICA from time to time. This is my opinion:TEXT: Britannica's writing style is more sophisticated, and its authors are very well known. However, Encarta is not bad written at all, its authors are good and the contents are more or less the same, or better in the last versions.You can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year, but only quarterly (4 times). Encarta is updated EVERY WEEK with new articles and additions to the old ones.MULTIMEDIA and FEATURES: Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries, Atlas, 2 D and 3 D virtual tours, timeline, games ... It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text, multimedia and features are completely integrated.NAVIGATING: Encarta wins again. You only have to type a phrase, a word or de beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contains it. If you have typed the name of a small village lost in Senegal (e.g.), you see it in the Atlas without clicking again. If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you meet with what was looking for. To go ""jumping"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the ""Related Articles"" section. If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft's WORD is perfect.Navigating with Britannica is different. You do not get crazy, but ... I only say that, if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings.My computer is Pentium III 1000 Mhz 256 RAM, and I have copied Britannica into the hard drive (the same with Encarta). The fact is that it is very slow, and that takes a lot of RAM (50 % more or less). If you have other programs open, perhaps Britannica does not work. With Encarta, you do not have any problem.I hope my opinion is helpful for you."

I eventually hung up. I never did get through to a sympathetic human being.Come on Symantec.Please test your updates more thoroughly before release.Employ more humans / phone lines and less answering machines.Remember, without customers you wont have any business.I have been very happy with your products until now.Let's have better Customer Support."

29862,0,"I'm always reluctant to upgrade any Adobe products and the upgrades from Elements 2 to 3 to 4 have been no different. I upgraded to 4 simply because 3 would not run when we switched to Tiger on our Quicksilver. 3 would run fine on two Powerbooks with the same flavor of Tiger, but not on the Quicksilver (???).For the amateur, Elements is an excellent, if not superb, photo editor. For maintaining web sites, its very strong with the right set of tools for batch processing. While the tools are not as extensive as competing products, Elements just burns right through the job much faster than any other program I've used.The user experience is the problem and, in my belief, a big one. It looks like garbage on the screen, right out of Windows. Tiny icons, disorganized, completely different windows handling (close, hide, etc) than any other Mac app and dreadfully lousy as a result. Error messages that make no sense are the norm (just repeat what you tried to do in the first place and it will likely work).I use Elements for a very restricted set of requirements: some editing, reordering in the browser and batch renaming. For every day use, I don't go near it. Graphic Converter. Cheaper, easier to use, Mac interface, bullet proof code and lively response as opposed to Elements taking forever to open and balks at the slighest provocation. And, Elements can and does crash or is Force Quitted at times.Quite frankly, understand your criteria. I've been using Elements 2, 3 and now 4 for about 5 years now and believe iPhoto or any of the software that comes with digital cameras is better for casual use and GraphicConverter for more demanding use."

The characters talked but the voices came out later, (like watching a bad chinese movie). The activities were boring, except for the part were the kids made up their own stories.I figure that if you will spend [the money]...on software for kids, it better be good.

63627,1,"If you do any kind of computer graphics then you should have this program. Its without a doubt the best image editing software on the planet, and with this newest version it gets even better. When I first got into this latest release I noticed that they made some cosmetic changes to the layout. They added some more buttons on the top of the screen, which really helps save time searching around for certain functions, and of course you can customize this if you like. From what I have seen so far from using this is that there really isn't anything significantly new. There is a new style function which you can stylize layers, but I'm not exactly sure what use this has besides being able to create tacky logos :) If this was just an upgrade you are thinking of over v5.0 or 5.5 I would try out the demo before buying it, because there really isn't a drastic improvement, at least for what I use it for. But, if you have never owned a copy of Photoshop, theres no better time to get this than the present."
9183,0,"I've used the Accordance program for almost a year now. It does have a great selection of content but you can't seem find one package that has everything you need. I guess that's a good marketing ploy to sell more product but it drives the consumer mad (drives me mad anyway). Sadly, the biggest problem I've had with the program is the user interface. Trying to use the program feels about as frustrating as trying to back a double trailer up a winding mountain road. If the user interface was rebuilt to be user friendly, logical and clean then I would be a much happier man while using this program. That being said, it is still usable and after lots of time and effort you can figure out where things are at and make it play ball with you."
53647,1,"I'm a complete Linux newbie. Although I've worked with a number of operating systems--from DOS 2.something to Win2K, VAX/VMS, OS/400 and MPE--I really haven't used any of the UNIX-based OS's. After hearing all of the noise about Linux, I decided it was time to try it. I'll be honest--I chose Slackware because of its price. I know, I could have downloaded it for free, but then I'd have to buy manuals (or do a LOT of on-line research) and since I don't have a CD burner, it seemed easiest to buy a packaged product.I made the right choice. Installation was a breeze! I read the &quot;Slackware Linux Essentials&quot; book that comes with the CD's from cover to cover, then read Mr. Volkerding's installation guide (included in the CD set) as well before beginning my installation, then used both manuals as a reference while actually performing the install. It took a few hours to load the OS, but then I wasn't devoting my full attention, either. My installation worked right away, and I've picked up the very tip-of-the-iceberg basics fairly quickly, too. Granted, I have not yet attempted to configure the X environment (I'm still looking for the manuals for some of my hardware :) and I'm telnetting to that PC anyway).If you are not used to UNIX/Linux, some features, such as the requirement to mount and unmount CD's or floppies (and cd out of the /CDROM directory before trying to umount!) may seem a little quirky, but it's really fairly easy to use.If you are tired of &quot;doing windows&quot;, but are scared away from Linux by all of the &quot;gotta be a guru to use it&quot; hype, give Slackware a try. Just read the manual first--and it IS readable, for a technical document. For 20 bucks, you can't go wrong!"
92059,2,"The 3d view is very limited, you can walk through but you can't tilt your viewing angle vertically. The objects are very basic and there isn't much of a selection. The ""12 powerfull programs in 1"" is rediculous. The plumbing ""program"" is just a few bathroom objects that you can place in your house. The electrical and HVAC are just like the plumbing. Autoframing is useless. If you decide to change something you can't drag a box around everything and update them all at once. Example: i wanted to change my wall hieght, i had to right click on every wall, select ""wall properties"" from the menu, and then highlight a box and change it. And i had to do that for every wall seperately. The lanscaping feature where it changines the plants to show how they will look in 5 years just scales up some flat images of the plants."

If you want Office, then _buy_ Office, and don't blame Apple because you chose the wrong tool for the job.I'm not one of those Microsoft-bashers. I use Office on a Windows PC at work without complaint, but for my own use on my own Mac I prefer iWork to Office:mac 2008. Subjectively, it's more streamlined and user-friendly, and its compliment of applications and features better suits my purposes. Objectively, it's faster, more trouble-free, much better integrated with OS X and iLife, and it costs less.There is usually nothing particularly exciting about ""productivity software."" You mostly use it when you have to, not because you want to. But, iWork seems to be a little bit of a departure from the usual, and - at the risk of sounding geeky - it can be fun to use."
11420,1,"They say, if Ansel Adams was around he'd be snapping away with a digital camera. Maybe so, but I doubt he would be adding type to his images or cutting, pasting and warping. What for? My point is that from the beginning, Photoshop has had very little to do with photography.So Adobe got together with some photographers and ended up with something that leaves the emphasis on taking and fine-tuning a great photo--not altering, retouching or salvaging a poor one (although it can do all that). And what a program it is! Fast, intuitive and surprisingly easy to use. Reasonably priced, too.Lightroom also adapts to different ways of working. If you take pictures the old fashioned way and spend a day making 3 or 4 really memorable images, no problem. Or, if you want to take hundreds of shots and edit, in the hope that a few will be good, Lightroom is even better for that.Really great software and such a pleasure to see Adobe ""gets it""."

19303,0,"We got this for our six-year-old because she had enjoyed the Reader Rabbit games for kindergarten and 1st grade. Jump Start takes the same basic idea as Reader Rabbit: do discreet tasks that build math, phonics, logic or other skills, and then connect them with an overarching goal. In Jump Start, each task contributes towards making scooters that can win a race. Simple enough, but the logistics of the overall game are complex and are never explained. Apparently we are supposed to figure out a bunch of unintuitive rules through trial and error. We build scooters, sure, but there are many tiny hoops to jump through--you have to use this particular set of tools with this particular character in this order, then race on each track twice (why not once? why not three times?). The rules are never explained, and I had to find a walkthrough on the internet. No idea how we would have figured this out on our own. In the end, the overall story is not only needlessly complex, but sadly arbitrary, so while the individual skill-building tasks are fun, there is no motivation to continue with this game in the long run."

In fact, this makes it so easy you don't have to learn PS like a pro. You just have to have a good eye for making settings adjustments with all the slider options, etc. This won't make you a great photographer but offers potential to make good images look great and save you lots of time doing it.

73458,1,"A high quality, effective interactive learning system. Two complaints:1) No obvious explanation of grammar. It took me forever to figure out what various particples and other ""connectors"" meant. If figured this out in an hour at a Japanese class and I am much the better for it.2) Romaji (spelling Japanese words phonetically with roman/english letters) is a waste. There are differing opinions on this. But my suggestion is to go through the comphrehension and speaking exercises, skip the word recognition and spelling exercises, and supplement the writing with a good book on Kanji and the Kana. Think about it, would a Chinese try to learn German by first trying to spell out all the German words with Kanji? Well, duh..."
22352,1,"I just love this old program. I have had such great success in cleaning up old recordings to tweaking them to my liking. It also does a great job capturing audio for me to create mp3s from. The weakness I've found with this old program is exporting mp3s at too low a bit rate as it has a hard time keeping the recording free from compression artifacts. I keep my files at 192 or above and it does just wonderful. However, my main computer with this program has had a c: drive failure and I've lost all of my programs, plugins, email, etc. as like an idiot, my computer wasn't backed up. Luckily all of my pictures and music are on their own individual hard drives. I am really hoping this great program will run with Windows 7. Keeping my fingers crossed as I don't want a new version."
4263,0,"I bought this language course for a relative from Turkey who wanted to improve her English. The reason I bought this product was that Turkish was one of the instructional languages available. During installation the user selects one of five languages of instruction (others are French, Russian, Spanish, German). These are used for the button labels, instructions, as well as grammar notes and an online dictionary.The course appears to be designed to teach basic (British) English to students of high-school level and up. I must say the course is pretty thorough, as it covers many grammar constructs and a good number of words. However, I found the design of the program and the pedagogical techniques used to be not so well thought out.What I disliked the most about the course was the design of the exercises. For example one exercise requires you to assemble the pieces of a puzzle made up of tiles with words. You need to put together six sentences of five words each. Each piece of the puzzle has a word printed on it, as well as part of a larger picture. When the pieces come together, you get to see what the whole picture is, along with the sentences printed on the picture. The strange thing is that more than one of the pieces can have the same word on them, like ""is"", so you need to figure out which duplicated word goes into which sentence according to the location of its puzzle piece within the big picture. So the exercise degenerates into assembling pieces of an image, rather than words of sentences.Other exercises are better thought out. One example is the one where the students acts as the receptionist at a hotel and must ask a series of questions (by typing) to a group of new customers about their nationality, where they come from, etc. The program has been programmed with a large number of possible sentences that the receptionist can ask that are all equally valid. Thus, in this case the student is not constrained into any pre-set sentence and can even experiment with alternative constructs.Another feature that may be quite useful is a visual sound wave form comparison tool to improve one's pronunciation against a native speaker's.Some of the exercises do require some studying without the computer. Of course, this would be unavoidable with any decent language instruction course. For example, after learning words for nationalities by looking at cartoons of some national stereotypes (""American"" is a man with cowboy hat and boots, carrying a brief case), the exercise that immediately follows the lesson makes you answer questions by typing the words correctly, within a time limit of fifteen seconds.(Speaking of learning about concepts by looking at cartoons, I found it odd that the adjective ""stupid"" was used to describe a man without any facial expression.)I found this instructional program to be a mixed bag. Mine is not the perspective of a non-English speaker, but I can easily imagine a student using this program generally benefiting from it while struggling with certain parts of it.I guess the decision to buy this product depends on whether better alternatives exist. I recently got to play with another similarly-priced program, ""Rosetta Stone English Explorer"" which was better designed as an instructional medium but seemed to have much more limited content than this one.In my case, I was rather unimpressed by the overall quality of ""Bridge to English Course"" and returned it to Amazon for a refund. I wish a review of this product were available before my purchase so that I could make a more informed decision. Amazon deducts a restocking fee if an item's reason for returning is ""Product quality is not up to my expectations"""
41246,2,"I have about 15 years experience programming for the PC and the Mac. I bought this product basically because there did not seem to be much else on the market. I would describe it as odd, and somewhat useless.I tried to back up 10 gb of data from my Powerbook hard drive to a firewire external disk. After some odd displays of counting over 100,000 files on my hard drive (there are actually less than 8,000) it announced that it could not deal with over 2 gb of data. That might have been ok in 1993, but not now.Then I tried the duplicate function. Again it counts zillions of non-existent files, then runs for 12 hours, then announces that it quits for unknown reasons after doing about 3 gb of data. I have tried this 6 times now and no joy.So I have had this product about a month and it has yet to be able to backup 10 gb of data.Two other comments: first, the prompts and messages seem to be written by someone for whom english is a very second or third language, and by someone who is utterly unfamiliar with the Apple style book. Second, as far as I can tell, it has no smart backup feature, where you can ask it to back up just files that have been touched since the last back up.All in all, I recommend that you pass on this product and write your own back up script."
56990,0,"A good product - reasonably simple to operate and the results are good. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the little rubber grips keep slipping and the Huey pops off. I think I've solved this problem by putting a bit of spit on each one. Seems to work fine now, but of course it messes up my screen so I constantly have to wipe it off. The other problem is that the room light monitor keeps disconnecting itself and I have to unplug and re-plug in the USB connector. I contacted support and was informed that this was a problem exclusive to Mac users that they were getting endless complaints about. I asked when a fix was going to be issued and the guy just laughed - I was not amused. Pantone has a pretty decent Mac market (the preferred choice of graphic designers - who all use Pantone) and should address this issue. When I pay for a product I expect no issues and if there is one it better be fixed fast. Get with it Pantone."
11255,2,"The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn. I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty. The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear. The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said. This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said. It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.I also tried to use this to learn Japanese. Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare. If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out. Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese. For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future ""I am"" it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese. You can't click them to have it sound out for you. In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out. So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese. I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese! So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product. Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more. Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit. I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's."

You need to learn about the plane , your enemy plane , Different missiles and their envelopes , radar range , when to track , when not to track, how to refuel, when to fire a missile and a whole lot more.So , if you want a game that you can master in a couple of weeks , this is not the one. If you are looking fo some simulator that will teach you about different weapons systems, tactics and more importantly how hard it is to be a real fighter pilot , this is a keeper.The graphics are excellent and very light on resources considering the vintage of the game.It is comparable to Microsoft CFS3 in the graphics quality but with 1/3 the resource usage.Buy it if you are a serious aero or sim enthusiast...you will LOVE IT."

57282,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

For $90.00, you can't beat it.Thanks for a great product Microsoft."
88607,0,"I bought the keyboard and a few of the games for my son when he was 2. He couldn't use the mouse yet but was always interested in the computer so this allowed him to play. He really loved pushing the buttons and watching the characters and other things appear on the screen. A few months later though he learned how to use a mouse and there was no going back. The games that you can buy for kids who can use a mouse are way more interactive and fun than this (and much cheaper). The keyboard is great for a baby or very young toddler, but too simple for older toddlers or pre-schoolers.Although many of the games say that they're interactive in the descriptions, I was a bit disappointed by the level of interactivity. The introductory game that you get with the keyboard for example, doesn't ask the child to do anything. I was hoping that it might ask them questions like ""what color is this tree"" and they'd have to push the green button on the keyboard to answer, but that's not the case. You just push buttons and little animations appear. Some of the other games have a bit of interactivity, but it's very limited.Like I said, great for babies, not so much for toddlers."
55985,1,"Although the game takes a little time to complete its fun to go around the island and listen to what the islanders have to say, and to me its still fun to beat the game, i've already beat it like 30 timesm, then I also play around with debug mode which is fun."
39086,1,"I'm a high school Chemistry student who recently starting using ChemTutor Excalibur. After purchasing this program, I began studying with it religiously because I found that it was a successful program that produced results for me. Chemisrty is unarguably a hard subject, and the vague examples and writing in textbooks can't really allow you to grasp the lesson being taught to you. With Chemtutor Excalibur I had the opportunity to quiz myself and practice repeatedly on a wide variety of Chemistry topics and questions, while getting an easy to follow explanation of the topic. ChemTutor Excalibur allows me to learn certain parts of Chemistry by starting with a basic lesson, which develops into a throrough study of the topic I'm learning, allowing me to take the information in at my own pace. I liked ChemTutor Excalibur a lot, and it has helped me much more than I can say for any other academic computer program. I had fun quizzing myself and watching my knowledge of Chemistry progress before me. Chemistry is a hard subject in general, but not for me anymore."
37344,2,"I purchased Nero after reading some of the glowing remarks here at Amazon.com. Although it copies CD to CD and does CD audio compilations quite well, I have yet to figure out how it's compiling DATA CD's. I followed the Wizard last night to copy some photos from different zip disks onto one CD, and by the time I got done, I wasn't sure if it had &quot;closed&quot; the CD or not; and when I tried to access the photos, I could only get at a handful of them, despite the fact that it had give me 5 successful burn messages.Then I read something in the online manual about multi-session, and Nero multi-mount. You have to go into Explorer, access that CD drive, and click on volumes, to see all the sessions, then click on the session you want to see. Well, I did that, and it wouldn't access that session. I fear I've made a coaster. All I want to do is put photos, data, etc., on the CD. I'd like to exchange photos with family and friends. I don't think it should be this difficult!I will be exploring other CD burning software."

34214,1,"Before finding ZDE I resulted to Macromedia Dreamweaver. An excellent program, but when compared to ZDE, it is garbage.One great feature is the function help. Lets say you are typing in a function like mysql_connect. Lets say you type in half the function name (Just ""mysql""). A small window will appear showing you all functions starting with mysql.Another feature is debugging. Press F5 and it runs a debug with a local server or the internal version of PHP. It also has a realtime debugging system. If the syntax is wrong it underlines the incorrect part.ZDE also has an intergrated MySQL database browser. This means you can view your tables in your database in the same programThere are also a lot of other small features like include checking and indenting.My only problem with this program is it's written in Java. This means that it is SLOW! And if Java crashes, so does ZDE. The means goodbye script that you have been working on for hours. I can understand why they did this. They have already designed an incredibal language and it would be a lot of work to design it in C++.Despite that problem this program is excellent and yoru will not be diappointed.One thing I should mention is that if you program in mutiple languages it may be better to get Dreamweaver as it has support for many languages"
62464,0,"I picked up this program from the local store and checked it out a couple times...Eventually I bought it, and it is not what I expected. The program claims to have the same feel as a real amp and little delay time. It also claims to be able to record what you play. So I installed it, and noticed instantly that there is a bad delay. I'm running a pretty quick little Sony VAIO with Windows XP so you can't blame the hardware. Next, I'm looking for a record feature. It does not exist! The product website disagrees with me, but it is not included in this program. Other than these issues, it is a very good quality program, but I personally do not find it to be worth the 80 bucks you'll have to pay for it..."
62989,0,"It's a lot like Panther, only buggy. Certain things are faster but the system hangs at odd moments on odd tasks. Dashboard is cool but extremely slow most of the time, either to update or display at all. Spotlight is effective but too slow to search through its index. I don't use Automator. Mail is really ugly now. Tiger has horrible issues with Illustrator CS. If you use Illustrator CS be prepared to be infuriated every 5 to 10 seconds when trying to select or move objects. Just say no to Tiger if you rely on Illustrator CS, seriously, I cannot stress this enough. Overall I am more unhappy than happy. It took my Mac, which used to ""just work"" and now it just kinda works. I think Tiger is a waste of money at the moment. If you have Panther, you really don't need it. For the record I have a 1.33 Ghz 12"" PowerBook G4 with an 80GB HD and 512MB RAM which should be more than enough Mac to run this thing. Supposedly if you wipe your system and do a clean install it runs much nicer, but I think that is unreasonable."
60315,2,"I can't believe in this day & age that a company such as Magix would stoop so low as to misrepresent a product such as this. On the box & in the manual they state there is an 'included MP3 encoder'. They even take the trouble to list a few 'demo items', on the gatefold of the box.When you go to actually install & then use this software- a popup informs you that the MP3 included is only good for 20 Mp3 conversions. For an additional fee (19.95) in the manual, maybe higher as it's not even listed on the Magix website, you can have 'unlimited use', of the MP3 encoder.What a joke !!I think that Amazon shouldn't even sell this product, as it's so badly misrepresented by the manufactuer.I will NEVER BUY MAGIX !!Make the argument to place of purchase , TAKE IT BACK !"

88526,1,"Its lots of fun to design the clothes. You can spend hours and hours having fun creating new outfits then seeing them come to life using the fashion show option. However actually printing your dress and trying to fashion it onto Barbie is very difficult, frustrating, expensive, and hardly ever looks as great on real Barbie than it did on digital Barbie, which of course can be expected. Still, I would recommend the product for all the fun it provides, as long as you use it as a game rather than a practical clothing making tool."
88050,1,"These cd-roms contain lots of fun interactive games and activities, which are especially good for children, but nevertheless enjoyable for people of all ages. For someone who knows very little Spanish vocabulary, it's a wonderful place to begin. It's also very helpful for travellers trying to learn helpful phrases and important words before a trip; in fact, there's even a section helping you to learn how to understand directions!However, I DO NOT recommend these cd-roms for people with an extensive background in Spanish. If you've taken a couple years of Spanish and have built up a moderate vocabulary, these cd-roms will not challenge you. Also, I do not recommend this program for anyone who wants to learn Spanish grammar. These cd-roms, as their title suggests, emphasize vocabulary, and speaking and listening skills, and they do not touch on grammar AT ALL.Overall, I consider this an excellent program for anyone planning a trip to Spain or Latin America, or for use as a supplement for *beginning* students of the language (an additional book on grammar would help). I really do enjoy these programs, and I just ordered the Russian cd-roms just like it. Since I don't know a word, it'll be perfect."
39419,0,"I am reasonably happy with Screen Blast Movie Studio 3.0. I am using a Sony VAIO computer Pentium 4 3 GHZ. 512 MB RAM 2 DVD-CD drives. I haven't had any of the crashes which others have written about here. I believe those are due to conflicts with other programs. For example the problems with importing Media into the Media Pool that one person wrote about could occur if you also have Adobe Photoshop installed on the computer. The crashing may be caused by one of Photoshop's associated files.This is not a difficult program to master. There are lots of show me tutorials provided with the program. Movie Studio provides up to 6 tracks if one wishes, three video and three audio. One finds it easy to do fades and transitions. I loaded a 35 minute clip where I had filmed an interview without stopping the camera. It's easy to combine stills and videos. I've appreciated the pan and crop feature for stills.Like others here I appreciate Movie Studio for what it does do. I am not happy for what it doesn't do which I think it should do. One cannot put in chapter points to DVD's unless one goes through the step of recording to a Mini DV tape first.Again, as others have said, Screen Blast seems a quite adequate piece of software. It's when you reach the step of wanting to burn to a DVD that you will experience some frustration.MY DVD which is shipped with Screen Blast, is a separate program which one loads upon completion of one's movie and after rendering the movie. Even then I couldn't seem to locate a finalizing feature. For that I needed to also buy Record NOW. I thought having the SONY name on my computer, my video editing software, and my camcorder would assure a seamless integration. This is not so. I can't use Movie Studio to convert analog video to digital through the camcorder. For that I will need to also purchase an IEEE compliant 1394 card or device.Some reviewers feel that Movie Studio is slow when it comes to rendering your finished movies. The steps to complete a finished DVD are complex. To write a 35 minute DVD took me a total of 75 minutes. This included rendering, building menus, transcoding, transcribing, planning the video and audio, and writing the files. It takes much less time if one wants to make a copy of the DVD. For that one can accomplish the task in about 15 minutes.I am also not happy to read that Sony is closing down its ScreenBlast.Com web site. I'm assuming this means that Sony may no longer even support Movie Studio.One's results using Movie Studio look quite professional. It is easy to add text overlays, music dubs and graphics. It is inexpensive as video software goes and provides many of the features that more expensive software has."
3661,1,"What a dilemma. I'm on information overload with all the media products out there, so I'm unsure what exactly I needed. This suite is a great place to start since there are so many programs. I did look at other programs and liked the features offered.On paper there are many programs with the same type of programs. I found a few features that swayed me roxio's way. In the slide show maker there is pan & zoom, but not every program has it. I thought this was a basic feature so I looked more closely at other programs. All of them also have basic video editing, but roxio has 2 track editing mode. This has a number of functions like picture in picture and placing a logo over footage. I don't have a Tivo but if I get one in the future there is the that feature.No doubt there may be some features that are in other programs that aren't in roxio. So far though this suite has the features I use. With time I may find that I will need even more features, but this is certainly a good way to start."

40495,1,"The idea for this book was sensationally clever, and the best part is that the story does nothing to diminish the sparkling entertainment for which we had hoped! Roberts give us a romantic thriller in Part I -- featuring small town antique store owner Laine Tavish. Daughter of con man and thief Jack O'Hara, she makes a straight life for herself after nearly following in dad's footsteps. When insurance investigator Max Gannon visits her shop hunting for stolen diamonds, he finds not only clues but instant love with the lovely Ms. Tavish. Together they stave off the bad guys, mostly one Alex Crew, and recover most of the gems in a suspenseful plot.JD Robb, author of the ""In Death"" series featuring NYPD homicide Lt. Eve Dallas, takes over in Part II. Almost half a century later, she is called to a murder scene at the house of O'Hara's granddaughter, author of a popular book about the missing diamonds. Soon Eve, with help as usual from hubby Roarke and sidekick (now fellow detective) Peabody, is headlong into both the new murders as well as hunting for the diamonds. Meanwhile, it seems Alex Crew's descendents may be trying to gain what is their ""due"", setting up a race to the finish that keeps we readers doing the same thing!We're devoted fans of Robb but had never read ""Roberts"" before. We had no doubt the popular author was inventive, and that she carries the co-author charade to the extent of two pictures on the back cover tells of her own humor and lust for life. For Eve Dallas fans, this novel is an incredible treat; and for those Robert's fans who haven't met her, enjoy!"
87480,0,"The included iGPS-360 receiver (rebranded with the Microsoft logo) is very sensitive and looks cute with the blue LED glowing. But the MS Streets and Trips 2005 is not so smart as expected. First of all, there's no turn-by-turn voice guidance. Neither does the software support the auto reroute feature --- you have to click the reroute button on the go. And there's no estimated time-to-destination prompt. Perhaps the worst impression you will get when following the driving directions from this software is that it will give you weird driving directions on the road which you know very well, say, the easiest way to drive to the highway from your home address. It does give you the directions driving the shortest distance to get on the highway, but wastes you a lot of time to detour. Although you can manually choose the quickest way, the software can't remember your driving preference. You'll have to tell it every time you use it.Cool GPS hardware, poor maping software."
92349,0,"I saw this film in theaters, even though I didn't expect much. I'm a fan of Jane Fonda and from the previews, she looked like she was back in fine form. The irony of the role is that she plays a self-absorbed, high-profile Barbara Walters-type television personality who becomes unhinged when her son (played by Michael Vartan) meets and engages himself to a woman (Jennifer Lopez) that Viola (Fonda) considers far beneath him. Like other romantic comedies, Jennifer has the habit of choosing the poor little lonely/working class girl (see ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""Maid in Manhattan""). I agree that the chemistry between J.Lo and Michael Vartan simply wasn't there. They don't seem much of a pair, had little in common, and gee...some lady at a party is going to tell her that the man she has the hots for is gay, and she believes her? Pathetic! This film could have been a lot better if they casted someone else. Because Jennifer Lopez's acting is dreadful, I ended up rooting for the slightly psychotic Jane Fonda as we see imagined scenes of Fonda bashing Lopez's face into a cake. I loved it!What saves this film from being a complete disaster and waste of time, though, is Wanda Sykes. She steals every scene with her comedic commentary. She and Jane Fonda make an excellent pair, and I found that I wanted the film to be more about those two. We simply don't see enough of Michael Vartan to get a sense of why he is so enamored of Jennifer Lopez. Perhaps it was all based on looks and a secret desire to upset his mother and show that he is master of his own life. By the end, there's the obligatory twist that supposedly redeems Viola to the audience as we see why she is the way she is, but it's a mere contrivance to this piece of tripe.The special features added to this dvd make it worth renting, just to watch them...but to own this dvd? How many times can you stand to watch Jennifer Lopez act? She's a better singer than actress and this film finally convinced me of it. I don't ever plan to watch a film with Jennifer Lopez in it again. She may look good, but I'm tired of her role choices and flat acting. When I watch her, I'm never lost in her character, because all I can see is Jennifer Lopez trying to be someone she's not with unconvincing results. As for Jane Fonda, I hope she will choose the kind of roles she has played in the past...smart, challenging, Oscar-worthy."
30521,1,"I'm one of those Spider-Man fans that doesn't feel like they need to own the actual comics and spend a thousand dollars, but I do want to read all of them. I've looked high and low for a complete collection that I can just read and enjoy and this is by far the best collection out there. It is so easy to use and fun to read. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because if you are zoomed to 100%, some of the words are blurry. Zooming in fixes this problem completely, but it makes navigating through the pages a little harder. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would recommend it to any web-slinger fan."

94470,1,"After using Norton antivirus for several years on multiple computers with no problems and the 2006 version ever since it came out, also with no problems, I thought it would be interesting to see what the state of the art was in antivirus software so I did some research on the Internet. I don't consider my computers slow like some people complain about, I just wanted to see what was out there. Generally, Norton gets decent reviews on most web sites but Kaspersky was often rated higher so I thought I would try it since my Norton subscription was expiring in a few days anyway. I ordered Kaspersky version 6.0 from Amazon for $50 with a $50 rebate and I thought it doesn't get any better than that. I uninstalled Norton and after installing Kaspersky, my computer continuously restarted. The manual tells what to do in such an event but their solution didn't work. I called their tech support and spent two hours on the phone trying to correct the problem. I downloaded and ran the Norton uninstaller, I downloaded and ran the Kaspersky uninstaller, I downloaded and installed Kaspersky version 7.0. We tried everything that the tech could think of, same problem. I asked him if this was a common problem and he said yes even though the manual says it is rare. It was late in the day and I was tired from the effort so I asked the tech if we could continue the next day and he said he would call me at 8 a.m. the next morning. Well, I've been around awhile and I doubted that he would call, and he didn't. After reviewing everything I had read about antivirus software and considering my experience with Norton, I downloaded and installed Norton antivirus 2008. It was easy and it's working perfectly. I'm sure that Kaspersky is excellent software if it works for you, but it didn't work for me and I'm not interested in going to all the effort it would require to try to make it work. I can count on one hand the number of times I have needed tech support for hardware or software so the fact that Norton charges for tech support is not important to me since I've never needed it anyway. I may try a different program someday, something like Nod 32 if they fix their interface, but for now I'm going to go by the old adage ""if it ain't broke don't fix it""."

76264,1,I have used turbo tax products for several years and they make an excellent product. One negative this year is a substantial price hike and the rebates that normally accompany this product were missing.
78360,2,"This product is advertised as a ""powerful masking"" tool that lets you ""isolate and separate a detailed foreground object from an image."" It is, however, an expensive tool that does not work as well as the tools built into Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro. The selection tools within Paint shop, including the magic wand, are far more discriminating than Knockout and require far less touch ups. I can isolate and separate objects from graphics with Paint Shop Pro in 1/10th of the time as Knockout allows and with 10 times the accuracy.We all want a simpler way to isolate objects from graphics but this just isn't it. Save your money and spend it on other photo editing software plug-ins."

77364,1,"It works although don't assume that it's perfect. It works best if you speak in long ""stream of consciousness"" sentences. In that context, it's nearly 100% accurate. On the other hand, if you're dictating shorter, business-like sentences with frequent starts and stops, it's a little less accurate. In my business setting, it's best to dictate large concepts and just get the information into the machine. Then, with the keyboard, it's easy to move text around, add bullets, fix punctuation, and correct recognition errors. Overall, it saves a lot of wear and tear on your hands if you just want to get your thoughts down on paper."

Fortunately I was able to port my info between taxcut Mac and Taxcut PC. I was unable to port my last years taxcut PC to my Turbotax Mac version this year. Overall TurboTax was smooth and direct. I normally go with the adage that 'you get what you pay for' and don't mind paying more for quality. In this case I did not see the justification.

I'm finally giving it up due to increasingly frequent tech problems over the last few years.Before you switch from Tax Cut, compare the prices: they want $45 for Fed+State; Tax Cut wants $30. NEITHER product includes free filing for tax year 2006.Macintosh support from Tax Cut (apparently missing last year) is back, and others have reviewed it under this product.Current Turbo Tax users (tax year 2006) are reporting that they are unable to import from prior-year Tax Cut, nor do the Turbo Tax specs say they can.If you are installing Turbo Tax on a Windows 98 machine, your installation will immediately abort & it will print out instructions for mailing the product back to them for a refund in 8 weeks.Footnote/suggestion for those wanting to save money: Just buy the basic package, then file on paper; if you file paper in February/March, before the rush, your refund comes back in about 10 days--almost as fast as with e-file. Then do your state return by hand: most state returns are a page or two with numbers taken right off the federal form; just use your prior-year return as a guide if you get stuck."

68981,1,"I was expecting this product to be just like apple's garage band. it defently isnt.when you record into the program with an intrument(i use my guitar and microphone) it imports into the program a little off. let me clarify: i could record a guitar part. then a bass part. when i play it back, they dont line up perfectly.another flaw is when you are recording you can use a metronome to hit on beats two and four. when i record a secound part, the metronme with hit on the and of one and the and of three. that really throws me off.this program does have some good!unlike garage band, the loops are stored on seperate disks that you upload in stead of the content taking up hardrive space.so this really is a good a product you just have to get around the problems. if you know what your doing when it comes to computers then get this product. you will be able to get the best of this product(it has a great ptential) if your not the best a computers then you might want a program that is a little easier to use."
36054,1,Most of this stuff should have come free with windows. i mostly bought it because i needed the alarm as a backup because my husband always forgets to set our alarm after he gets up. It has some nice product but truth most of them i havn't even touch yet i looked at them but said when would i ever use that.I mean plus party mode for media player and plus dancer their funny for a time but you get tired of a dancer on your scream doing the same moves over and over again. I hope this help some.

26829,0,"For the money, I guess I can't complain. The standard edition is a fraction of the cost of the &quot;full meal deal&quot;, but wish that MS wasn't so deceptive with their advertising. Microsoft's web page for VB.Net 2003 standard edtion displays all the features of the full blown version and none of the limitations that are in the standard version are listed. Given that, I would still buy it as this is my only choice. The one big limitation is that the standard edtion will not talk to a real SQL server data base. It will hook up to a MSDE database. I did discover that I can talk to an Access database that has tables linked to a SQL server database, so you can fake it, but I can't do Stored procs.MS used to have a page that listed the differences between versions, but I can't find it now. I don't think you can develop mobile applications either.Good luck"

23400,1,"This software came out of research at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. The limit artificial intelligence opponents are widely considered the best in the world. The no-limit opponents are okay. They are fantastic for training up as a beginner, and the developers keep improving them. Playing against computer opponents I can easily get through 300 hands an hour. This software has improved my game about 10-fold."
82129,2,"I bought McAfee internet security so that I could combine three programs (zonealarm, windows washer, Norton Anti-Virus) into one - what a mistake! First of all, it glitched during installation on my XP computer. Once installed, it caused major problems with Internet Explorer and Explorer. In fact, until I told the firewall to filter nothing (no protection) I couldn't even log onto the web. Then, it caused my computer to no longer accept keyboard entry in explorer and internet explorer. Finally, I uninstalled the whole thing and problems were solved, although it did leave behind at least one startup file problem.Also, the manual doesn't list any tech support phone, only web support. Once you get to the web (after installing the software!)it only gives you a 900 number for tech support - there is ZERO free support!I really didn't want to give my money to Symantec (Norton), but their anti-virus program works flawlessly. Do yourself a favor and do not buy or install this product."
36081,1,"I did not want this product. My husband bought it and thought it would be a good way to store the increasing number of digital photos on our computer. I liked my file folder system I already had. But once he taught me how to use it, I love it!! All the photos are right there to view. You can search by who is in the photo, there is a timeline at the top to view them by, etc. It took some time to classify all the existing photos, but it has been worth the time."
28463,1,"WOW! (and I mean that). This game is fantastic! All the Sesame Street humor, with really wonderful music and a lot of different activities. From Ernie's World (ala Wayne's World) where Ernie interjects funny words into songs sung by Cookie, Grover and Elmo to their hilarious disbelief (which had my wife and I on the floor laughing!), to Elmo's Music Machine (an endlessly replayable sampler/mixer of music snippets that let's kids put endless combinations of tunes together (an excellent learning tool! ), to Worldly Instruments where Elmo and Ernie play - in any combination - everything from Sitars and banjos to African drums and Trombones to, of things, a Hurdy Gurdy or a Theramine! As a musician and a parent who hopes to pass on the joy of music to my son and daughter, I could not believe our luck at finding this brilliant and wonderful product! My hat is off to Sesame Street with my endless respect and thanks! GO BUY THIS! WE ALL LOVE IT!"
63601,1,"I'm not going to waste time by listing all the new features since most have already been written about in the other reviews. I do want to say that the upgrade to Photoshop 6 is a true upgrade, not just bug fixes in a new box. I love it, and the new contextual menu bar. The improved text tool will save you so much time if you regularly work with text. Everything has been revamped to streamline the workflow, and now even Photoshop has slice tools so you no longer need to go to IR if you only want to dice your images.Also, I want to comment on the speed complaints. I am running a P3 700 with 320mb of ram and the upgrade is faster than 5.5. Don't believe the requirements on the box. To get maximum speed out of Photoshop you need at least 256mb of ram and more if you work on large images. RAM is dirt cheap as of this writing,... a 128mb dimm. RAM is the most overlooked speed bottleneck in computers. Go for the RAM...it will increase system and stability more than just adding a faster processor."
31208,1,"This is an outstanding software title, and the story is wonderful and engrossing, but unfortunately the Amazon listings do not show the age of the product. I believe this may be the old MacOS ""Classic"" version along with the Windows 95/98 version.In many cases you will be able to get some of the older software like this to work on Windows 7/Vista, as those platforms are more concerned with compatibility. In the case of newer Intel Macs, you will not get this software to run at all unless you run it with emulation software.Suggestions for Mac Users:*Pick up an old iMac, install OS 8.6 or 9. Set the screen size to 640x480. It will run happily there as designed.*Install an emulator like Parallels, install Windows XP, and run it there.It is possible to run ""Classic"" emulators on your Intel Mac but in general the experience will be far less polished and you'll need to spend quite a bit of time to get the emulation running like you want.Disclaimer: It is possible that this software title does work on Intel Macs. However, I can't confirm except for the fact that I recently had to install this software for a teacher and it was the Classic version from circa 1995."
7935,1,"I switched to Mac in December and got the OS X 10.5 with the computer. It runs smoothly and without a hitch, which is very commendable.I was not accustomed to the different tools, and therefore have left some of them unused to this day. I don't for example use the mail feature, the iChat, or the iCal. Furthermore there are some applications, that I don't think fantastic, for example Safari, which I did use for a short while but found to be utterly inferior to Mozillas browser (it will for example not open hotmail).There are far too many things in the OS X that you don't need, yet are still there and set up as standards, which is a bit irritating. It takes forever to find out where these files are hidden and change/delete them. It is a lot harder, in my opinion at least, to tailor your computer to your needs with OS X than with Windows, change settings and preferences and so on.However, there are redeeming factors. The preview function, that lets you look at most files without running the application that you'd normally use to open them in, is priceless. That really comes in handy a lot. The time machine function, that makes a backup of your harddisk, is also very handy, and takes a load of your mind. I have loads of photos and text that I'd rather not loose because of system failure, and I'm sure that goes for most people.The 'search' set up makes it fairly easy to locate a file you yourself have created, but is otherwise very limited seeing that it doesn't search all folders. I personally had a hell of a time trying to re-install some Adobe software because I couldn't locate a file that turned out to be in the ""library"" folder using the search function.In conclusion I'll say that I don't think this is a superior operating system, but it is definitely not inferior either. I would like more personal control over things, but I do get how it is nice that you can (if you choose to) just sit back and let Apple handle everything for you. I wouldn't switch to Mac just to get to use OS X, but I wouldn't run Windows on my Mac either."
800,1,"I have been using the Compton's Interactive Bible for several years while doing Bible Study. It is convenient while I have my study book laid out on the desk just to type in a verse designation and the program just goes there. Since I am already at the computer, I can then go online and check another version or expansion of the verse in question. This Bible is the New International Version which seems so popular among the authors of Bible Studies and even the Sunday School Booklets that we prepare with. Within the program itself are notations, pictures, introductions to the books of the Bible, multimedia presentations and much more. I have had this inexpensive Bible for several years and have not yet explored all the various uses and ways to enjoy the Word of God. I have given it as gifts and all who receive it are amazed. You can certainly pay more for a computer Bible program, and perhaps one will have more features. This one has more then met my needs and I am sure will continue to do so in the future."
41661,0,"I consider this program worth buying, but with the caveat that it has almost no directions (at least mine didn't) and I spent some time just trying to figure out how to get it to produce the printed/faxed apprearance I wanted. If you're good at figuring things out or just have a little time to spend getting to know the software, it's not bad.Here are some things it does that I did like:-Easy to fax through on-line fax service-Keeps running tab of paid/unpaid invoices for each client-Doesn't require that you open different files--it's all there together.Suggestion to manufacturer: include tutorial or handbook."

57302,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

92075,1,"Let me make one thing clear: AppleWorks is not Microsoft Word. It is not Microsoft Office. And it is not a substitute for Word or Office, just as a Honda Civic isn't a substitute for a Hummer. It is, however, much easier to use, much less intrusive, and much less expensive. If you need Microsoft Office's features, by all means buy a copy. If you need to exchange files with Office users, it's probably a good idea to buy Office. But If you need to get work done quickly and easily, grab a copy of AppleWorks. All the modules (Word processor, graphics, spreadsheet, and presentation) are seamlessly integrated. Screen clutter is minimal (though the toolbars could be smaller.) Basic (and I stress basic) compatibility with Word and Excel files is included. But its strongest point is its ability to stay out of your way: it doesn't try to reformat your work to suit it's own ends, or make grammatical decisions for you, and the on-line help is helpful, not intrusive."

I download transactions from Discover, National City Bank, and my 401k at Fidelity. They all work ok. I really like the return of net worth graphs with history.I was a bit concerned about the conversion and would not have done it for the fact that Quicken is pulling the plug on 2002 version in April. As a precaution, I backed up the old version from my hard drive to a CD just in case. I had no install problems; no need to call for tech support. All is well."

If you donate clothing, household goods, or other items to charity...&quot;The inside cover lists specific examples, the last on the list is &quot;Computer Monitor&quot;, in &quot;Good&quot; condition. It looks as if you can deduct $107 for such an item.What the box DOESN'T say is that to access values for &quot;Electronics and Computers&quot;, you need &quot;ItsDeductible Deluxe features&quot;. For these you pay an additional $10 to &quot;upgrade your software online&quot;.Gripe 2:There's nothing on the box to tell you the software can only be used for one tax year - and you must buy another license to use it for a second tax year. You don't discover this until you start the program for the first time AFTER you've installed the software. The example on the back cover of the box shows the tax year is a pull-down selection list, but when you see the actual screen, the year is just fixed text showing the year you selected when you first ran the program.This is very tacky. It's hard to believe it's legal to do this. I presume Intuit is assuming it will be too much trouble for anyone to go after them.These irritations are a shame because the product otherwise has good potential. Yes you could use an Excel spreadsheet as I already did to track my original donations, but correlating donation and value is much quicker with ItsDeductible.My one electronic item? (a used boom-box in good condition) NO WAY I'LL PAY THE $10 UPGRADE. I'll just make up a dollar value and think less of Intuit."

5563,1,I played the computer game SET for the first time last night at a party my parents went to. It was fun but challenging because the computer was finding more sets than I was in the beginning. Other people got interested in the game and everyone started looking for the sets. Then I began to see the sets faster and could beat the computer. I liked it because it lets me play one on one against the computer while I'm learning the game and I know I can get good enough to beat the computer and even those other people who were looking over my shoulder.
15818,0,"MYDeluxe Invoices and Estimates by Elibrium is a basic invoicing program, and this version (5.0) includes purchase orders as well. It will keep track of your sales and also includes an item list. It also includes a customer list.There are a few things that hold it back from being really GOOD - namely it's limited customization of the forms. The purchase orders, for one, cannot be altered ONE BIT! Furthermore, the invoices themselves can be changed, but only to a very limited degree. One of my other major gripes is regarding its lack of an invoice search feature. It is mightily frustrating when you need to find an invoice and you must actually scroll through every invoice you have concocted since the one you are searching for.HOWEVER, for the price, it contains enough usefullness to warrant a purchase for most small businesses that are still stuck on handwritten invoicing."

I purchased Office 95 ($400+ dollars) in 1996. When Office 97 came out, my Office 95 software would not open office 97 formatted documents. I toughed it out till I purchased Office 2000 ($500+ dollars) now Office XP and 2003 have came out (do we see a pattern here)?

I still can't rate this higher than 3 stars because Roxio took there own sweet time developing this software before it would work right out of the box.

94238,0,"My first impressions, I haven't had a chance to really get deep into playing with it:Even though ECDC has many new options, it really lacks in documentation, particularly in the troubleshooting area. One thing I can't understand is why a CDRW created on one computer don't work on another computer that also has ECDC 5 installed. The troubleshooting guides included and online don't address this issue.As for customer support, I sent in an email to their tech support well over 2 weeks ago, and to this date (4-1-02) have not received a reply.Another annoying little detail is the project selector that resides in your tool bar running in the background. There's no option to stop it from loading during a bootup. I had to edit my registry manually to keep it from starting. However, there are more configuration settings in this version than in the past.One good thing I noticed, after upgrading from V3.5c, if you select the &quot;Do not show this again&quot; for the popup window telling you a CD was ejected, it will continue to work even after a reboot. Before you had to select it every session.Even though Scandisk and Undelete is located in the project selector, there are no shortcuts created in the startup menu. I find this to be annoying since I don't want the project selector running full time. I manually created these two shortcuts.For you people that haven't done so yet, go to their website and download the updates. It fixes some bugs and identifies more CDRW drives."

Its incredible how customizable it is, and i can see why so many schools have implemented it into their curriculum. That being said, their customer service is second to none.

45094,1,"I bought this for my almost 4 year old. She played it joyously for about 3 weeks. The songs are great in it, and the graphics are beautiful; the pets are adorable, you earn rewards so you can feed, pet, brush, and play with each different pet. If your child needs to learn to use a mouse, this is a perfect, throughly enjoyable game. My almost 4 year old, now, is bored of it, though; it's not challanging enough - does not advance to a high enough level for a four year old. But since it is 'preschool' it's done its job. My 4 year old has her choice of about 40 (yes forty) different educational games that range from preschool to grade 2 and she loved this one the best out of all of them. If you want to purchase this as a gift for someone who has a 2-3 year old, your gift will be the hit of the party, and the whole year, in fact. It's extremely well-done. Children advance quickly in home computer games -- faster than they do in school because they have so much time to access it. So even a 3.5 year old would adore it. What is important, i found, was this game gave my child the emmense *confidence* to throughly learn a _whole_ game! Something her 5 1/2 year old sister does on a routine basis. It would take a two or just-turned-three year old a good long while to tire of this game. Of all the jumpstart and reader rabbit games i have bought, this one was kindest, gentlest, and most entertaining (the ""I am a Horse"" song is worth the cd alone.)A nice feature added to the 'advanced' jumpstarts is the 'assesment test' -- which, after you childs name is typed or clicked into the box at the beginning of each game -- you can click on and you child can take a quick 'test' to determine which level the game should set each catagory of learning at. Each catagory (shapes, music, colors, alphabet) can be set at a 1-3 level. When you take the self-assesment test, the computer will show you what level your childs responses earn her. And then will autmatically adjust to each level for you, or you can over ride it and set them yourself manually. All the Advanced jumpstart products have this. It's helpful to a parent. There is also a 'report card' like thing inside which shows what part of the game your child is playing and how many guesses and right responses she or he is earning. In preschool it's a nice feature, but as you go up in Jumpstart Advanced, it's a real eye opener as to what your child is doing and learning.Do not confuse this Jumpstart program with any other jumpstart preschool versions. All versions differ completely. It must say Jumpstart _Advanced_ preschool. It is only one disc. Highly recommended. I can't wait to move her on to the Jumpstart Advanced Kindergarden game. I have the Jumpstart Advanced Grade One and her five 1/2 year old sister loves it!"

55951,1,Dreamweaver has possibly one of the easiest interfaces that you could ask for in a webdesign program. I have been using DW since version 3 came out and i have not had one complaint about it. This program is leaps and bounds ahead of MS Frontpage 2002.

93078,1,"I purchased this product a few years ago, at a very good price. It is excellent for those with limited experience with HTML, and allows the quick production of decent looking web pages and consistently styled websites. And I thoroughly appreciate the products ability to generate appropriate navagational links for each page in the site structure.These strengths also lead to designer weaknesses. The web design industry has moved away from strict HTML coding for both structure and presentation, and moved to XHTML (for structure) and CSS (for presentation). Designers who rely too heavily on Fusion's HTML formatting of presentation run the risk of creating much more work in the future, that could be saved through the proper use of CSS. (A good book on better coding practices is ""Web Standards Solutions"" by Dan Cederholm, and should be consulted once the initial flurry of design work is done, to truly appreciate the wisdom of separating presentation from structure.)Since I haven't used more than 30% of Fusion 7.5's full abilities, much more remains to be discovered. Their current (version 10 ?) and future products may have all of these issues addressed and improved upon."

My kit did not come with the replacement battery cover (indicated in the literature) that you use to attach the GPS to the mounting hardware. This is not a problem if you have a newer GPS which came with its own screw-on hardware, making a battery cover version redundant. But if you lost that little piece, you won't be able to mount your GPS unless you happen to have the battery cover from another kit (such as the bike mount kit).2. File sizes for route-calculating CitySelect Maps are about 1/3 larger than non-route-calculating maps, so if you've used MetroGuide or another ""lesser"" product, you will not be able to fit as many maps on your GPS as you are used to. On these 24 MB GPS's, expect to fit the majority of one large metro area (like the Bay Area), but nothing else. If you're going on a road trip, you may need to get rid of your local maps or even take your laptop in order to load new maps as you go. I was able to load the important local areas and the maps for the route to my family's mountain property, so that's good enough for me.3. The maps are great and have a lot of detail, but keep in mind that your screen isn't very big, so you're probably best off using the text directions for driving. Also, the Legend and Vista can't ""beep"" very loudly, so if you're listening to the stereo and not paying attention, you may miss a turn.4. As you've noticed, the price is highway robbery (pardon the pun), but you are getting a quality product that does what it is supposed to do and is easy to use. For road trips, the gas station and resturaunt information is particularly useful, since you won't get that on a regular map. This is by no means an essential accessory, especially if you just use your GPS for geocaching or other ""outdoors"" activities, but it's great for driving, so it's up to the individual to decide if they want to pony up for this luxury item. Also, if you are researching GPS units, keep in mind that this software plus the GPS could easily cost as much as the Quest, a much more powerful unit that includes this software and hardware for free and has way more map storage capacity. You should only go the Legend+software route if you also need a durable portable handheld GPS for other activites. The etrex line are pretty much indestructable, which is good because I've dropped mine many times already. The Quest looks like it wouldn't survive such use.5. The cigarette lighter power adapter has a cable length of 6 feet, in case anyone is wondering. It plugs into the USB port of your GPS.6. The mounting stand articulates in enough ways that you'll find a good viewing position regardless of where you have to put the mount, so no worries there.7. This is not the latest version of the software, but a free update will be mailed to you from Garmin when you request it.I hope that can help people make a more-informed purchase."
39842,1,I received exactly what I ordered I love the Hallmark paper and have used it forever. The card paper appears to have a special coating on it that makes pictures on my cards really stand out. I was happy because I got what I ordered in the timeline that I was told and was kept informed as the shipment progressed.
62363,1,"This is an excellent program for moving your installed programs to your new computer. For that, it works great. I have done two migrations and had no problems at all. It is not really for bulk file moves. Basically, if your installed software is in the add/remove list, it will move it."
61290,0,"We purchased this product for our (advanced) 5th grade son. We did so, since this came up under a search for childrens' software. We did not see any age range anywhere. Well...he loves the concepts, but the physics that needs to be done is not only above his head, but mine as well! The first few problems we had no difficulty with, then we hit a wall.Great game, just be aware this is for those in High School and up!"
74763,1,"Windows XP's built-in disk defragmenter was barely tolerable when I had three or four gigabytes of stuff on my hard drive. It was completely unbearable when this number grew to 32 GB. The utility would chug away for hours at a time, moving huge blocks of data here and there -- and moving them again the next time I ran it. There was no end to it! Clearly, I needed an alternative.At work, on Windows NT, I've been using Diskeeper ever since Version 4, and have never had any major cause for complaint. So, after checking this page for reviews, I went ahead and ordered Version 7. The installation went very smoothly, and within half an hour I had both my internal C drive and my external FireWire drive, each with 32 GB, completely defragged. Great!Diskeeper also works well on Zip disks, though I probably won't bother to defrag them all the time.By default, Diskeeper's ""Set It and Forget It"" enables something called ""Smart Scheduling"", which basically allows Diskeeper to keep the disk reasonably defragmented while I work. This is particularly useful given that I don't leave my home computer up 24x7, so can't just schedule a defrag at 3 a.m. like I do at work. There is a priority form on the Action menu which gives ""Set It and Forget It"" the lowest priority, meaning that I shouldn't even notice it going, except for an occasional burst of drive activity.At least, that's the way it's supposed to work.I wasn't even fully aware of this feature for the first couple or three weeks -- until one evening I suddenly found myself completely unable to do anything. My computer was basically locked up while the drive churned furiously, for five, ten, twenty minutes! In the distance thunder rumbled ominously. While I have both a UPS and a surge protector, I prefer to have my machine turned off in a storm. Trying to abort Diskeeper probably wouldn't be too swift. Who knows what might get corrupted? Finish, already!Well, eventually it did, and I went in and disabled the ""Smart Scheduling"" for each drive. As a result manual defrags now take somewhat longer than before, but still no more than five or ten minutes. Since I'm doing it when it's convenient for me, and I've long been in the habit of doing it manually at home at least once a week, I have no real complaints. I suppose I could go out to Executive Software's web site and look for a program update, but don't really see the need.Another plus: I found Diskeeper's help pages to be very informative and clearly written. Among other things I learned that I no longer need to do those potentially risky boot-time directory consolidations, because Windows XP allows on-line directory defragmentation. While I've never had a problem with boot-time operations under previous versions of Diskeeper at work, the help pages do suggest backing up important data first. If my home computer crashes, I can't turn to the help desk to fix it. So it's good I can leave well enough alone.All in all, Diskeeper 7 is plenty good enough for my needs, and well worth the money."
67565,0,"Gulp! Lego really have made one strange game! And to be honest not the best game in the world. However, This is great for very young kids and the creativity will have them busy for hours at a time.When you're 'driving' all you have to do is hold the up button on the keyboard and the game will almost completely steer for you! The camera angle to see where your driving....grrrrrrrr...it's so frustrating!But, as I say, this is a game for very young gamers. At least, 5+ - 6+. However, even when you are an older gamer, creating your own track rocks! The level of things to put on is amazing!That is what really makes the game.Multiplayer is NOT worth talking about. It is really bad and pointless. Half the time you have no clue where you are!Overall, I think this is a brill game for young children, but is far too easy for older people. For creativity it's worth every penny, but for life span and addictiveness, you really will be rather disappointed."
73672,1,"I picked up this game because of the low price and I wanted a filler inbetween some of the Nancy Drew games I like to play. The ND games are very addictive so I thought this might be a simple game that didn't involve too much thinking and would be something to have on hand to play every now and then. Well this game is very addictive and I've only had it a week and I'm almost done with it. It really is a lot of fun. My husband saw me playing and then got into it himself. He's been avoiding it lately because when you start to play, you get hooked and lose track of time.The good thing about this game is even if you finish the actual game, there is a mode where you can just do endless play that allows to keep going until you lose 4 customers. This records your high score and you can keep playing till you get a higher one. You could acutally do the same with the main game play as well because it keeps adding up the total amount taken in at the restaurant through each level. There is a certain amount you are supposed to earn each level and once you hit that mark, you can try and reach the expert part and that gives you a start for that level. I only got a few stars and there were 2 levels that were so difficult and frusterating that I was just so happy to be past them and didn't care if I reached the expert level or not.Overall this is a really cute fun little game for all ages. I'm 34 and really enjoy playing it."
3213,1,"My boys love this software. Especially my 6 yr. old. It is a little difficult at first to use the program, but once I showed him how to the first time, he had no problems after that.

11965,0,"Being one of the many people who paid the $10.00 to try a beta O/S,I think XP is worth $10.00 and only $10.00. Where are the improvements? I see really nothing about this O/S to warrant an applause of any kind, just look beyond the facelift and count the REAL improvements, there are few. To charge a price higher for XP than the Millenium upgrade would be a real shame, along the same line as any other money hungry manufacturer of hypped up overpriced and over advertised ,SHELFWARE.Do I need XP?Do you need XP?If you think about it and research it you will likely find out you dont anymore than you needed Millenium Editon.Didnt every one just dig into their pockets last October for Millenium?Were you satisfied with it?Why should you be paying for another O/S not even 1 year later?Linux and BeOS (Personal Ed.)are both FREE and have just as good appearance, with all the applications an average person could likely ever use. Considering most people have purchased software that does all of the so called NEW things included in XP ,the least they could have done was to make it compatable with ALL win98 software and hardware, but i supose if they did that people wouldn't have to dig deep into their pockets to purchase new compatable components, for instance Norton Antivirus 2001 or a Vodoo2 1000 accelerator card isnt really THAT old i'm sure.In a nutshell XP is nothing more than M.E. with add ons that most people are already using and alot of those addons can be downloaded from the manufacturer FREE .Have you ever seen anything free from Micro$oft ?"

14925,1,"Overall I give Beyond TV3 a 5 star rating because of all valuable tools it has given my computer. There are some limitations I have to work with, but they maybe a result of my lack of knowledge and/or required hardware. The computer I am using this program with has the following components: P4 2.4ghz CPU, 1.5 GB RAM, ATI 9800XT/128MB RAM, Audigy4 Soundcard and a Hauppauge WinTV Go-Plus PCI TV card, with Windows XP Service Pack 2, Norton Internet Security and DSL. My experience with the program has been a little more than one week.The installation of the program was flawless.The TiVo features the software maker claims work as stated. Time shifting, being able to watch a recorded part of a program currently being recorded, works well. I was concerned MPEG-2 encoding would not work because my TV card did not support it. This was not a problem. The remote control of my TV card also works fine.Converting recorded program files to a format that would play on my Pocket PC worked well. The features associated with saving hard disc space I have not used very much, but what I have used has also worked well.The Cons or Limitations with this program based upon what I know ( Which maybe missing a great deal) are: You do not have to pay a subscription fee for TiVo that is fine, but you have to leave your computer on all the time, or be vigilant enough to know when to turn it off and on. It may be cheaper but it is not free if you are used to turning off or putting your computer to sleep while you are not using it.An earlier reviewer here stated that if you used Windows Media Player while a program was being recorded, the recording process was damaged. I have not tested that on my system, but I have found playing a game that puts any significant load on the graphics card has the same result. I doubt that people having motherboards supporting dual processors would have any better luck. By the way this was not something I did on purpose. This is something to keep in mind if you have a computer recording programs that may also be used for games by the other half of the household population.The good news in this regard is you can load up your system with Office applications, email stuff, and do some non-media type surfing on the internet without having any effect of the quality of the program being recorded. The ability to do this might be affected by the components you have in your computer.If you are considering purchasing this program you might be also thinking about what TV card to buy or if the one you have is adequate. The bottom of the line Huappauge TVcard and remote (also important) works for my purposes.The TV cards I have experience with have a feature called pinned on top. This feature coupled with the ability to control the size of the screen makes it possible to keep a reduced screen in the same place on top of any other window screens regardless of the window based selections. For example, unless you have a pinned on top window on top of a Word Document or any other application, it will not disappear the moment you make a mouse click or keypress. Being able to type in Word and keep another application on the screen is just one example of what pinned on top can do.Taking a program recorded by SnapStream and playing it back using the VCR function of Hauppauge would seem to be the way to work around this short fall. Unfortunately I have not been able to get this to work.As mentioned by other revieweres, this version come with a free upgrade to Version 4. The request I made for this upgrade by email took about a week and one half to process.One of the strong points of this program has beyond the ability to capture desiriable programs put on the air (so to speak) is the data compression features it has.My experience with the user interface to get and watch programs has worked GREAT! Understanding and using all the data compression features of this program has is beyond me at this point in time. Version 4 and my bottom of the line TV card has DivX encoding. What that does is not much of a concern to me as disc space is not a concern.If you have a TV card in your computer, this is a must have program. If you do not have a TV card in your computer, this is a good reason to get one.Not that it will do any good, but I will request SnapStream to include a pinned on top functionality in their furture releases of software."
37233,1,"Readiris Pro 11 is the one software that is the solution to all of you scanner needs. Whether it is graphics, text or (are you sitting down) sheet music. ReadirisPro11 allows you to edit, move, change, remove any part of you scanned image and for sheet music it will even play it as a midi file. I would rate ReadirisPro11 an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10."

6792,0,"For anyone planning a trip to Brazil, this is a good program to get. However, for anyone interested in learning continental Portugeuse (i.e. European dialect) this module is not as useful. For a non-native speaker, the Brazilean dialect often seems faster and more melodic than the language spoken in Portugal. The continental language is often slower and more pronounced, or annunciated. Overall, the package is good with useful interactive activities. However, the package should be labelled &quot;Brazilean Portuguese&quot;."

My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.Installation went smooth as silk and I have not experienced any problems at all. I had to find a couple of new drivers for hardware but that's been it. And for Home Edition versus Pro, I think I can be quite happy with the Home Edition.I will say that win98se had been a headache for a long time so the stability that I see so far with XP Home is a relief.Good features, good reliability. A very decent upgrade. I recommend it. Four stars."

41297,2,"Don't waste your time. This software is not easy to use, dosen't transfer most programs so that they will work. If you use the expert mode to select only a few files you will need to delete all the item you don't want one by one, and each one takes a 30 seconds, takes hours just to create your list. And when your done you get a bunch of garbage you don't want. I was so disappointed with the results I had to do a system restore on my band new computer.Take a pass."

WinXP is much faster then Win2000. If you want to have a computer be aware of Windows 95. Windows 95 can only play weak PC games that have 300Mhz or lower. 98 can play most out of all PC games.

58825,1,"Yet again, Adobe have made available a professional product at consumer prices. The only problem is that consumer class PCs are not up to the task. Anyone using a PC for any video production is recommended to enhance their hardware by installing a couple of IDE or SATA hard drives in a RAID array, as a primary media drive, and also install another hard drive to export their DVD productions onto. A gig or two gig of good quality RAM is also recommended, as is the use of Windows XP Pro with all drives and partitions formatted as NTFS.In addition, be sure to frequently defrag the media drives, and delete any unneeded files, as this will also help with production quality, and avoid your drives filling up too soon :-)As to Encore itself, it has everything reasonably required to make sophisticated DVDs - often too sophisticated - and is compatible with other Adobe authoring applications."

13748,0,"I purchased the ZoneAlarm Internet Suite to replace the expiring Norton Internet Security which was on my computer. I chose ZoneAlarm due to the high ratings of the firewall by PC Magazine and due to rebates.I do believe that ZoneAlarm is a very good firewall, but there are issues that I have been having with the software that would cause me to hesitate to purchase it again. Both ZoneAlarm and Norton have the option to teach the firewall which programs should be allowed to access the internet or to make changes to the registry and which program should be prevented from doing so. Both programs popup alerts to ask the user for input. However, Norton has a much more complete list of programs which are threats and which are safe. For example, ZoneAlarm gave warning for programs such as Internet Explorer, Windows Updater, Adobe PDF and the Restore Wizard. All of these are programs that are probably on at least 90% of the PCs out there. Why didn't ZoneAlarm add them to the safe list so that the user would not be bothered? It seems a simple thing to do to reduce the aggravation of the alerts.On my PC I have an advertisement blocking software that I have been using for years. Norton noticed it but once I told Norton that the program was safe, Norton left it alone. ZoneAlarm gives me alerts about this program each time I startup and shut down windows. I have told ZoneAlarm that the program is trusted, but I have not been successful in stopping the annoying alerts which require me to click in a window before the computer will finish booting or shutting down.During the installation, ZoneAlarm did not successfully install my license key and gave me warnings that my updates would expire in 21 days. I contacted customer support via email (calling them costs a few dollars per minute) and was pleasantly surprised that I received a response within hours, even on the weekend. I never got such a response from Norton or McAffe. Kudos to ZoneAlarm for have a very responsive customer support team.In summary, a very good firewall and good antivirus and antispam product. However, be prepared for the annoyance of alerts for common programs after you first install ZoneAlarm Internet Suite. There is a bigger learning curve for ZoneAlarm than for Norton. But, be comforted by the fact that ZoneAlarm has a responsive customer support team."

89695,1,"I have been fortunate enough to use this product on my computer for the last several weeks, ans may I say, it has been rock-solid. It has not crashed once for any reason whatsoever. Although designed for a professional business-oriented computing environment, Windows 98 home users won't find it initimidating. One of my favorite features is an option to view thumbnails of images, such as a folder of JPEG images.If it were just for that, I would have given this product 5 stars. However, because of driver availability (which is not Microsoft's fault, anyway), I can't say I'm totally thrilled with this product. I have a HP external CD-R drive, which I can't use until 3/15 when HP releases the W2K drivers.Aside from that, it's a marvelous product. However, I don't recommend running it on anything less than a Pentium II with 64 megs of ram. It bogged my Pentium 233, even with 96 megs of ram, that I had to go out and purchase a K6-2-450 processor instead. Problem solved."
75294,1,"I am a user of Quickbooks Pro 2004 and have just converted one company to Peachtree. Although I will continue to use Quickbooks also (very popular in this area), I am very impressed by this software.Pros - The installation was seemless. It only took 3 minutes to register on the 800 number. The (customizable) user interface is a real strongpoint. From My Business you can get where you want to be with one click. Reports are customizable. The user manual is very good. If you want to badly enough, you can enter your own user maintained payroll tables although I suspect the average user will do well to purchase the Peachtree updates for inhouse payroll. I am using Peachtree with the latest version of Pervasive.SQL (8.6); I was presented with a dialog asking if I wanted to do this (I do) and so far no problems at all. For those who remember the Btrieve problems of years ago, rest easy; the bugs are gone. For those who like to actually CLOSE their books (which you can't do in QB), you can; some people may see this as a con. You can see up to 2 previous years business; you might want to save pre-closing data as a separate company at years end.Cons - If you are converting from Quickbooks don't expect individual transactions to be imported. This should not be surprising given the (excessively) proprietary QB db. The account balances will come over UP TO the day you choose to begin entering data (chosen during the conversion process). The customer/vendor lists etc. did come over, but you will want to edit them before you start entering business. Subaccounts become regular accounts during the conversion, but you can set up department masking (explained in the manual). If you are converting a company using Cash Basis instead of Accrual (I was), the accounts come over, but balances have to be entered manually. All this is explained in the Users Manual.This is good accounting software. I'd much rather see them implement a registration strategy than absorb losses that could cause the excellent quality to suffer. I'm giving this one 5 stars."

Also, free upgrades are available on-line and that's an easy procedure too.To make the state series most useable, you need to add Back Roads Explorer, which gives much more detailed up-to-date street and street name information.The only caveates with this program is that you need a relatively fast computer and lots of memory so you can copy the whole program to your hard drive so you don't have to constantly change cd's. Also, expect to take some time to fully get to know this program."
6894,1,"Museum-goers and art lovers will find hours of fun and learning in this program; the quality of the graphics is spectactular, and one truly realizes the sheer genius and scope of Michelangelo's work by seeing much of it collected in one reference. A great, interactive complement to books on the subject, and though it's no substitute for seeing the works in person, if you're like me, this may be the closest you're likely to get for awhile. Highly recommended."
62335,1,"I was looking for an easy way to mix music for fun, and when I found the MTV Music Generator at such a low price I decided to try it out. I don't regret it at all. Using the Music Generator is so much fun-- mostly because it's so intuitive and hassle-free. You can make Rock, Techno, House, Beat or Bass &amp; Drums tracks, choosing &amp; editing hundreds of bass lines, drum loops, melodies, vocals, percussion and sound effects (like scratching). I was just a little dissappointed that you can't make hip-hop tracks, but considering the price, I can't complain. Besides making your own songs you can also join a group online in &quot;Music Jam&quot; and mix interactively with people from all over the world, or create a 3D video to accompany your song. You can also convert your songs to MP3 or WAV format if you want to burn them onto a CD. Overall, the MTV Music Generator is a great buy, I'd recommend it to anyone."

44799,1,"This product was good for me because it set goals for me according to my time constraints. The diagnostic test showed my strengths and weaknesses, and selected the items that were most appropriate for me to study. It contains flash cards, games, and a vocabulary builder on top of the lessons. The program was easy to use. I don't like that you have to buy the complete set of LSAT, GMAT, and GRE, when most likely you will only be taking one of these tests. Overall it was a good product!"
30127,1,"A 1-month trial version of this came with my new Dell PC (Windows Vista and Core 2 Duo). It was a better deal to purchase a complete copy of this software than simply upgrading the subscription that came with the PC because the complete version allows installation on up to three PCs. With the two mail-in rebates, it was a no-brainer. (The rebates did not apply to upgrading the version shipped with my PC.) I have not noticed any sluggish behavior so far. It installed perfectly over the trial version."

It is very hard to find this CD in a store so I always use Amazon.com to find the hard to get items.
6770,0,"I think this is pretty cool software as long as you've studiedJapanese some before. Otherwise it's a bit too hard. I used it and mypartner used it--I've had some Japanese in school and he hasn't. It was hard for him to figure out, but for me it was a terrific review. On the other hand, it was fun to help him out with it, too. My only complaint is that the hiragana and katakana practice is sort of superficial."
80823,1,"This a great substitute to the Mcafee and Norton headaches I have experienced over the years. The program installed quickly without conflicting with other programs and immediately found some spyware on my system. A lot of the ""fluff"" found in other virus programs is missing here - you really feel it is a lean and mean program dedicated specifically for keeping your computer safe, not trying to get you to buy more software. There are only two things I found a little annoying: the user interface is almost too basic. It was hard to tell if some of the virus protection programs were running, and then I had to go in and activate them. The program also wants to update constantly. This sounds good but when you update, it immediately wants to restart the computer everytime. This is happening so often, that it may just be bug I am experiencing on my own since I did not see it in the other reviews. Other then this it is a solid antivirus program, and well worth the money."
53903,0,"I have been using it for a couple of months now. Much simpler than VisualAge for Java. It does everything I need. Good debugging, good editor, decent GUI builder.

It's not bad, but IntelliJ is clearly superior."

When I called MS customer service for help getting my printer driver recognized, they kept me on the phone for an hour with no help or end in sight. First they wanted to know everything about my compter, then everything about the software (where did I buy it & a million numbers), then they wanted to know everything about me, and while this questioning was taking place, I surfed over to HP to find out that not only was my printer not VISTA friendly, but they didn't have an updated VISTA driver for it. I guess I should have done that first. The printer is fairly new. oh well!"

20648,1,"I haven't used Studio 8 yet, but it is basically Studio 7 plus the ability to import and edit MPEGs, and other formats, which for me is enough reason to get it. If you use it with a TV card, you could essentially record television shows onto your hard drive as an MPEG and then edit out the commericials with Studio 8. I also plan to use it for tweaking up some of my older MPEG movies that I made on Studio 6 by taking advantage of color correction, scrolling credits, etc. It's an extremely easy program to use, but it is very well equipped to do just about anything. Definately worth the price. I love filmmaking, and since I started with Studio 6, I have never had any reason to try anything else."
79958,0,"I have been using this program for about 2 weeks now after upgrading from Money 2004. As others have stated, I wouldn't rush to upgrade to Money 2005 either!1.) It could be my imagination, but it appears that at least when using the portfolio window, that the area devoted to displaying the data has been reduced. (larger borders?).2.) They have removed or buried certain features.3.) The quotes update seems to be slower and sometimes the indication is that the update has been completed when it actually hasn't.4.) In certain portfolio mutual fund displays, the line market value totals are wrong, yet the grand total line is correct.5.) There was a 2004 portfolio display feature which allowed you to position or find a stock on the screen by entering the first letter of a symbol. That feature is gone.6.) I kind of get the feeling that eventually they will take out the portfolio part of this program, move it up one level and charge more for the same thing.7.) I can't seem to be able to get the same portfolio sequence as I did in Money 2004 when displaying mutual funds, stocks and cds on the same screen. So I am forced to use one screen view for mutual funds, and another for stocks and another for cds.8.) The portfolio sort sequencing for the days value change doesn't seem to work right when more than one mutual fund is displayed on the screen.I don't plan on going back to Money 2004, but just living with this new version for now. However I would be compelled to look at what the competition offers once the bundled tax software deals start coming out."
12080,1,"Windows XP does the deed that Microsoft has been aiming to achieve since the milestone release of Windows 95. I have been using Windows XP since pre-beta 2 when the OS was still under the codename Whistler. I have seen the ups and downs, the improvements, the additions and subtractions and have been very please with what as been done with Windows XP.It makes installing hardware a breeze with enhanced plus and play technology. Simply plug in your camera, usb device, hard drive, external storage, etc and Windows XP will automatically install and set it up for use. Integrated CD Burning will save you time and money from having to purchase 3rd party applications. Remote Desktop is a wonderful feature for administering your Windows XP computer away from the home or office on a separate computer. All you need to do is install the Remote Desktop client on any computer that does not run Windows XP and you are set.You can also use Remote Assistance to send an invite to a friend, co-worker, relative, anyone you know using Windows XP to control your computer and fix any issue you may be having with it.Windows Media Player 8 is wonderful, allowing you to encode high quality songs from CD's and also including options to display the Album Cover artwork for identifying your music on the folder.My favorite thing is the ability to change the appearance with the new XML skinning engine to completely have a custom and unique style from anyone in the world.There are many wonderful feature to list, and despite the talk that it is just a small step from Windows 2000 is ludicrous. Windows 2000 is similar and on the same codebase, but does outperform and include more useful tools. I would recommend purchasing the full version and not the upgrade, that way if you ever need to install a clean version of Windows XP you will not have to install an OS to upgrade from."

71141,1,"Adobe Photoshop Elements 4 has some new features that make it an all-in-one tool for getting the most from your photos. The first step in any photo project is to import your photos from your camera onto your hard drive and Elements' Photo Downloader makes storing photos easy. A new feature in this latest version is the automatic red eye correction. When this option is selected in the Photo Downloader, your photos are automatically analyzed for red eye and the correction is made for you as your photos are loaded. Organizing your photos becomes challenging as your collection grows. However with a little help from the Organizer, you can keep your photos organized and easy to find. You can switch between the Photo Browser and the Date View which helps you find your photos by date, import batch, folder location, meta-data, caption, note, file name and so on. Of course, the Keyword Tag System has been improved also. New to this version is the addition of camera meta-data such as camera model and shutter speed. You can also use the Find By Visual Similarity With Selected Photo(s) command to find photos that have common visual aspects such as clothing or scenic locations. You can even set certain folders as watched folders and Elements will keep track of new additions to these folders and notify you accordingly. This feature must have been created just for me. I'm always starting new folders for my images because I can never remember which folder I was using for a specific project, especially if it has been some time since I have worked on that project. Now I just set them as watched folders and let Elements keep track of them for me. Within the Organizer, you can also order prints, share photos online or by email and switch to the Quick Fix, Standard Edit or Creation Setup Wizard.Viewing and fixing your photos is easy within the Quick Fix workspace. Along the side of the generous viewing area are the tools that you use most frequently including the Zoom, Hand, Crop, Red Eye and the new Magic Selection Brush tool. As in all Adobe software, the Options Bar across the top changes as each tool is selected. I especially like the new Magic Selection Brush tool for isolating the subject of a photo from the background. You just brush your mouse over the subject and Elements completes the selection around the subject for you. On the right of the workspace are the tools used to correct or adjust your photos such as Smart Fix, Red Eye Fix, Levels, Contrast, Color and Sharpen. You start by clicking the Auto button to use the default settings and then make finer adjustments with slider bars. Everything is right there in the same place and there are no floating palettes to clutter the workspace.The Standard Edit workspace is for finer adjustments to your photos. You have all the familiar tools and some new ones including the Magic Selection Brush that we talked about earlier and the Cookie Cutter tool. You also have an improved Spot Healing Brush and Straighten Tool. I really like the improvements to the Spot Healing Brush. It does a much better job at preserving the original texture and shading when you remove objects or flaws from photos which lessens the need to make further touch ups. The Straighten Tool is handy for those photos that are just a little crooked. You just drag your mouse over the photo to set a guideline which Elements then uses to straighten your photo - all in one quick step. New also is the Adjust Color for Skin Tone command used to correct skin tone in your photos. You click on an area where the skin tone is correct and Elements uses this sample to correct the rest of the skin tones in the photo. Of course, you still have the familiar Styles and Effects and Layers palettes.This latest version of Elements has some new features for scrapbooking. As mentioned earlier, one of the new tools is the Cookie Cutter tool. This new one-step tool makes cutting shapes from your photos a snap. Just choose a shape from a large variety and drag your mouse over the area of the photo you wish to keep. When you release your mouse button, the rest of the photo becomes transparent. You then can adjust the size and location of the shape if needed.If you are like me, you place three, four or more photos on the scanner and scan them all at one time. In the past, the result was one large image containing all the photos and you had to manually separate them. Now, Elements does it for you. It automatically finds the edges of each photo, crops away the empty area between the photos and opens each photo into the workspace individually. Boy, is that a time saver.Another time saver is the Magic Extracter feature which is another way to isolate a portion of a photo. Within the Magic Extractor dialog box, you first click on the subject you wish to keep with the Foreground Brush tool and then click on the area you wish to remove with the Background Brush tool. Then click the Preview button and use the fine adjustment tools and Smoothing Brush to complete the process.Switch to the Creation Setup Wizard and you can create many projects from preinstalled, customizable templates. The Slide Show feature is my favorite. You can add pan and zoom or transition effects, include clipart, text and even audio. Then save your slide show in a format optimized for disc, screen, web or email. Other projects include photo album pages, a bound photo book, greeting cards, calendars and HTML photo gallery."

Throughout all the modelling and landscaping I have done, I have faithfully turned to Bryce.It offers the basics shapes (spheres, cubes...), but its real power is in landscaping and scenary renders, offering you many filters and tools to creat unique and detailed mountains.The simple set-up of this program makes it easy for everyone to use. I have to agree that rendering takes longer than I would like, but you can always buy more RAM and increase your speed.I did switch over to Lightwave and 3dsmax for a while; however, I did not like the four screen set-up, and returned once again to Bryce for it's nifty camera switches.All and all, it's a wonderful program for those looking to pick up this hobby."

1695,0,"This was a very helpful program during my most recent vacation from Kansas to Minnesota's ""Mall Of America"". There are several features on this program that I love, and honestly, enjoyed. However, the ability to utilize this program successfully ""in flight"" depends largely on your intimate knowledge of the program's fine tuning tools. If you don't wish to deviate from the pre-planned route the only suggestion is to make sure you have the ""directions"" window open above the GPS map so that you can see the next move, ESPECIALLY when inside large cities where lane changes need to take place, as it will NOT display the NEXT move to you until, perhaps, it is too late. We did alot of circling around on our maiden voyage with this tool, and we had a great time, as long as you can laugh about it...The main benefit/suggestion I can give is to make sure you have a confident navigator experienced with Windows applications that won't ""crack under pressure"", otherwise it can be very frustrating and distracting for the pilot, so I guess that's why they put up the DISCLAIMER, EVERYTIME you log in to START GPS tracking, lol....>>> I will continue to use this, love it, but just like any other program you have to familarize yourself with the details to truly work the magic...co-pilot training continues. Oh yeah, not all the locations you ""search"" for would be listed automatically, don't know if it's advertising or what, but if you can skip the address to the map, insert it manually on as a ""stop"" it works wonders. You can even go down to street level and scroll around from there to see the local attractions, eats, etc. Even gives you a phone number to call on the experiences I've had. Found a suggested local Chinese restaurant off the beaten path in downtown Des Moines that was wonderful!"

92347,1,Hi well to me I loved this film it was very funny hence it being a romantic comdey and enjoyed the actors in the film. I loved the clothing and my only draw back is the language but it was very little in cursing and jane fonda attacking a pop singer inspired by spears and others. But well worth renting from video store.One tip if you think you wanna buy a dvd always rent it first to see if you want to own it. I do want to own this now that i've seen it.

85548,1,"Our game arrived last night. For the most part my [...] loved playing it. I thought the variety of musical activities and the story line made the program fun. She takes violin lessons and it reinforced a number of the concepts she had learned. Sir Sour Note is a bit creepy but she didn't seem to mind.She especially liked the area where she could make her own music and listen to what she had created. I was impressed by how quickly she picked up the various activities. And yes as one reviewer said I needed to stay in the room with her. But I don't see that as a negative.The only down side (as others have mentioned) is that the rhythm areas where you copy an animated character's rhythm are a bit too challenging to mimic with a space bar. The space bar is too sensitive for little fingers and makes extra beats. The software is old generation, but not dated. It is inexpensive so worth the money. Hopefully it will be updated because it is hard to find good music software for children!"

I love the fact that you can customize each resume and letter. Heck I used this program to write my cover letters, thank you letters and my letter of resignation.It won't do the work for you and like anything you get what you put into it.

10487,2,"I am working on a Power Machintosh G3 with Mac OS 9.2. Having used Freehand 5.5 for several years I was looking forward to upgrading to a more functional version. I specifically needed the new function of creating PDF files.None of my expectations of FH10 have been met.Exported PDF files are incomplete. Items are dropped without any discernible reason. This makes the function useless except for base preliminary review purposes.The exporting functions get hung up and it is necessary to toggle over to the finder to get the export to finish.The application runs slow. It takes a full second to change over tools which leave me magnifying when I try to drag, editing text when I am trying to draw a line and pulling objects off the page when I was reorienting the view window manually.The basic key command, Command (.) to stop and action, no longer stops anything that I have used it on even though it is referred to in the action window.I have lost two major files due to application failures. One corruption was due to a crash and a second corruption of a file that occurred after saving it. These two failures alone have cost me days of labor. Saving the files regularly does no good if the file itself is corrupted due to some programming error.I am running 4 times the requested memory for the application. That translates to 15 times my largest file. It cuts into my use of other applications for no increase in utility. There must be a big hole in the program regarding memory management as there is one files I can not open ""out of memory"" even though it is a small fraction of the application memory allocated.To put the icing on this, customer support now requires hours of searching tech notes, which seem to be users comments, or paying to get information on a product they seemingly have not finished."

19690,1,"My sister who taught math and wrote math curriculum for her district gave this to my son when he was two. It is designed for kids age 3 - 6 but if you have a kid who is ready early it is still a great game. He was already tinkering with the computer and loved this game. The bright colors and funny looking bugs were engaging. There are 8 games and they all have 3 difficulty levels so you child will have room to grow as they master the games at each difficulty level.Playing with this game was how my son learned how to use the mouse and started to become comfortable using the computer. This kept his attention until the end of Kindergarten. Now that he is a first grader he teaches the games to his younger brother.It's a cute game (even for someone with a bug phobia like me), is not annoying for adults and teaches many of the math skills that they covered in Kindergarten; my son first learned many of the math concepts taught in Kindergarten from this game and the lessons at school were more like review for him. This game is a great value because it is fun and educational."
62241,0,"I have 2 children, a 1 yr old and a 3 1/2 year old. The reviews on this product sounded super. However, I wasn't all that impressed. It wasn't 'glitzy' enough for my 1 year old to be interested. And it was boring and not at all challenging for my 3 year old. My 3 year old thought it was cute but cute was about all I would give it to. Now, Barney All around the Town CD-Rom Computer game is all that.....engaging and entertaining for BOTH my kids. I had the same expectations for this one but was let down. It is ""cute"" though."

45976,0,"Many people voted for StarOffice simply because it is cheaper than MS Office or hoping that it will force MS to lower prices on its MS Office sometimes in the future. I personally don't agree because people shouldn't compare StarOffice to MSOffice head to head, but with other alternatives as well. For a little more ... people can get some better suites like Works Suites or Corel Family Pack. For family users, I'll recommend Works Suites for its generous software bundle while for office users, I'll recommend Corel Family Pack as its spreadsheet is 100 times more powerful than StarCalc. I use StarOffice simply because it works well with my Linux system. I suggest people considering StarOffice take a look on the reviews on Works Suite & Corel Family Pack in Cnet before making the decision."
93032,0,"I work in a lab environment with over 50 computers so I know a thing or two about viruses and virus scanners. I recently bought this product for my parents computer which is an aging cyrix 300. In the lab we use a similar product to this with much faster machines and I have personally used McAfee in the past with good results.This product has made me change my mind about McAfee. Sure, there are some nice features like the automatic virus definition updates and email scan, but this product performs very poorly on an older machine. It takes several seconds to load on boot and makes the machine perform significantly slower in almost all operations. In fact, it makes it perform so poorly that mp3s often skip for my parents which is simply unacceptable.The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I know that my parents are protected against viruses and the automatic update feature makes their lives easier. However, my future virus scanner purchases will likely be with Norton or Panda."

I have tried Pocket Quicken as well and I'm happy to say that Pocket Money 2.1 is easier to use and more powerful (as well as less expensive!) than even Pocket Quicken. And as I mentioned in my title, this the only Palm app that I use on a daily basis..aside from the Datebook!I use this in place of Quicken or MS Money. You heard me right...this little app is robust enough to be your stand alone financial software. Even better is that it's portable and does many of the things the desktop money managers do. Of course you can use it as a supplement for Quicken/MS Money as it does export QIF files, but on it's own, PM has the power and features to do everything you need.Setting up accounts is easy as is doing the actual tracking of debits/credits and so on. You can set up recurring payments, regular deposits, and so on. You can set up which accounts are counted as part of your total net worth on the overview screen so that you always have a snapshot of just how much money you really have. The portability factor is great...stop at an ATM or purchase something and you can quickly record the transaction with a minimum of stylus taps and not have to worry about entering the receipts in your desktop PC when you get home.The app is stable (never crashes), small in size (only a few hundred Kilobytes) and the password screen is a welcome basic safety feature. Plus, all your card info and bank contact data can safely be stored in this app in the event that you lose your wallet or need to call your bank!If you buy just one Palm application or if you feel the need to organize your finances (and keep them organized), Pocket Money is a worthwhile purchase. I can't say enough about this great product!"
12603,1,"This version of Windows is rather impressive. After using it for a few days now, I am beginning to like it a lot. It is very user friendly, and, most importantly, it won't crash. A few of my programs will still crash, but they don't take Windows down with them. That is enough insentive to buy this in itself. The fact that it looks nicer and is easier to use are simply added bonuses. My qualms with it are that it is somewhat overpriced, and the product activation is a real drag if you want to upgrade more than one computer. It is supposed to prevent software piracy, but all it means for the home user is that you have to buy a new copy of the software for each computer you own. Aside from that, this is definetly a must-have upgrade (if your comp. meets the minimum requirements)."

52126,0,"Bought and installed 2003 as the last fully functional version of Quicken. I had upgraded to 2005 when Intuit stopped supporting 2003, bad mistake. 2005 stopped allowing .qif imports and exports of investment accounts. When Intuit stopped supporting 2005 (cutting off account and price history updates) I moved to MS Money (did not like Money it was slow and bloated), then exported account data via MS Money .qif export and imported to Quicken 2003. I imported price history and weekly price updates from my Google>portfolio>download to spreadsheet function. Although I have to go out to each of my financial institutions and manually download transactions, I no longer am dependent on Intuits built-in sunset policy."
71984,0,"I have used Streets and Trips extensively in my business travel over the past several years, updating annually. I found the new versions to offer improvements, if often limited ones, until the current version. While I have found some new streets on the 2003 version, it no longer shows many of the hotels that were shown on the 2002 version, including several that I located originally using Streets and Tips. I think overall, it is a step backwards."
25216,0,"I'm a loyal SystemWorks customer. I really enjoyed NSW2001PRO with my Windows 98 laptop. After I upgraded to an IBM T30 with XP Pro, I decided to upgrade my NSW since many apps were not compatible. To my surprise, NSW2002 did not have many of the apps I found so useful in the previous version. This almost seems like a downgrade, specially in the CleanSweap software. There's really nothing &quot;PRO&quot; about this suite. The antivirus is still tops, but there is really no reason to upgrade from 2001. I finally decided to uninstall the thing (a hassle), re-install it without CleanSweap 2002, and then install Cleansweap 2001, which integrated with the Suite."

20474,1,"I bought the Sony IP5 MicroMV Digital Video Camera expecting more companies to support the format. Right now it looks like Pinnacle is the only one to support it besides Sony. Ughh... Can you say Betamax?It took Pinnacle a while to get the bugs out, but I've downloaded the free upgrades and am now running version 8.7. It is one hundred times better than Sony's MovieShaker software that came with the IP5. I've made two short clips and burned both as VCDs (I don't have a DVD burner, yet). Great results both times.If you have a MicroMV get this software now. I am so thankful to Pinnacle for supporting MicroMV."
4154,0,I don't want to rate the product as such (3 means neutral) but I would advise anyone thinking of using Peachtree to either have an understanding of accounting or an accountant nearby. It is a very good program but it does demand some accounting kowledge or technical skill.
43145,1,I have no complaints about this newer version of office 2007 other than the fact that I have begun to hear rumbles of a 2010 version coming out next year and probably shouldn't have jumped the gun so quickly on 2007.
90027,1,This is a great program that changes wave files into mp3 files so they can be downloaded to iTunes or copied to a music CD. I have recorded music for 40 years on tape and this program easily transfers taped music to mp3 files. I recently purchased a digital recorder that records wave files and Magix mp3 Maker 2005 Deluxe converts these files to mp3 so I can edit them and copy the finished product to iTunes or CD. I am completely satisfied with this program.
75081,1,"Reference Manager is a huge time saver for students as well as professors. Right out of the box, it is very intuitive to figure out how to use this program to insert citations into papers and format your references. A toolbar in Microsoft Word makes it easy to insert citations while you write either individually or en masse. Click, click, click. When you finish the text, you can choose the reference format you need. Get rejected from one journal? You just click a few buttons to reformat your in-text citations and reference list rather than spend hours deleting periods from authors' names.Directly exporting references from search engines is very handy, too. This way you have a well-organized database with full reference information that you can keep coming back. This is not always a perfect process, but comes close enough.Another option for building a reference database is to tell Reference Manager what sort of references you need, but I don't recommend this method. It is easier to work with familiar search engines that are formatted for your field than try to go through an unwieldy middle-man.All around an excellent product to help you write research papers and to establish a personalized electronic library for yourself."
42216,1,"OneNote is my favorite software package. I use it for work, graduate school and personal projects. It has an intuitive interface and is easily reconfigurable. Data is safed automatically as it is entered. I use both the link and clip features all the time. With the link you can easily create hyperlinks to files on your own computer or the web. With the clip command, you can capture all of a part of a page/graphic/anything and it will automatically be pasted into your OneNote file. This is also a great tool for a student. Terrific!"
32563,1,I recently purchased this product and have been very pleased with it. Very easy to use and the fact that you can print photos with or without captions is a great feature. It also great for organizing and searching a large number of photos as well as burning to a photo album.
36903,1,"Let's face it: Microsoft Word is the most annoying computer program yet written. Mr. Bill just keeps adding annoying &quot;feature&quot; upon annoying &quot;feature&quot;.When I move to a new work station, I must spend hours undoing Mr. Bill's &quot;features&quot; to get a usable word processor.You won't have that experience with WordPro. It will put you in control again. That's why I have WordPro at home. I just want to write and WordPro lets me get on with it.Not that WordPro isn't a powerful piece of software. I haven't yet run across a formating challenge that it couldn't handle.The dictionary bug mentioned by an earlier reviewer hasn't been a problem in the (newer) versions of WordPro with which I'm familiar. I have a great many scientific words added to my dictionary and it still works smoothly."
57279,1,"I bought my Garmin E Trex Vista on the recommendation of the salesman, telling me that I can &quot;hook it up to my computer, and download maps&quot;. Even the manual that came with the GPS gave a quick blurb about adding their MapSource software to add &quot;detailed map data&quot; to the very limited map that's built-into the unit. So I investigated both the Topo maps, and Recreational maps at the Garmin website, and both seemed quite a bit more detailed, even though my favorite lake looked only like a rough representation, with only one hill. Then I checked out Map Tech, and the detail was ten-fold! It showed every little slope, and accurately depicted every inch of the shoreline, so I bought it. The only glitch I noticed, was that the cursor on the map is supposed to show elevation, but if you follow one line thats supposedly following a contour, it's plus or minus 15 feet as you scroll, and when I pointed at the lake, then at a thirty foot hill, it showed the same elevation between the two, where the field right next to it accurately showed every foot difference of elevation But when I tried downloading the maps into my Garmin Vista, I found the only thing you can transfer back and forth between the GPS and computer were waypoints, tracks, and routes. So all I could download were little dots on that screen, which shows my lake as a blank field. Garmin Website tells me the only GPS units that accept map upgrades, (Mapsource only), are the GPS12 Map, GPS III+, E-Map, GPS Map 295, and the Street Pilot. I guess all I can do with the MapTech is print the maps to carry to the field, lug my lap-top with me on a hike, or buy a handheld, but someone else wrote that his Compaq works,but not Palm? All I wanted was a small GPS, which I could take on a hike, and have it show me very detailed maps, so I could find the best routes, and I'd never have to worry about getting lost. This one only shows main roads, how to get back to your starting point, and little lines to follow if I pre determine a route at home."
48924,1,"This product must honeslty be the best product I have every tried for my kids. They enjoy the project and fun activities available for them... and it's not all about direct teach, this programs uses an indirect teaching method that makes it ten times more entertaining for them. I can truthfully say that I recommend this program to parents who want their children to get that extra bit of help without making it seem like it."
64430,1,"Thhis prgm is one of the all time BEST for educational and fun, I was sooo excited to find it again that I didNot look at the system specs., It also will not run on Windows Vista, actually it gets hung up on the quicktime load - wonder if there's a fix-it out there ??"
76482,1,I have spent several years as a beta tester for TurboTax and this newest version definitely improves tax preparation for the home preparer. The new live community helps find quick answers to perplexing tax questions and the dual refund monitor lets you see how much your refund is for both state and federal at the same time. And finally e-file is free. I have used this product for years now and this year will be another great improvement.

40682,1,"I purchased this for my girlfriend, Beth, who has been really into decorating and interior design. Before I knew it, she'd gone nuts with the idea and re-organized and re-decorated the whole house -- with the exception of my office. She told me I'd be sorry for not letting her in there to make sure the Chi was moving properly. Truth be told, she was right. I'm going to let her work on my office since all of a sudden I find myself feeling very energized when in the rest of the house and very melancholy when in my office.This piece of software has changed our lives. Chi moves freely throughout the house -- and our lives."
92582,1,Great deal if you don't care about the other office products -just the basic four. This edition allows you to use it on up to 4 computers at your house for a fraction of the cost. Not just for the teachers and students but for the whole family.
46938,1,"IF and ONLY if you want to use a 8088-80286 IBM PC with 512-1000K RAM and an old dot-matrix or laserjet printer (many inkjets can emulate one of the printer options,I honestly don't rememberif the program uses Postscript...I don't think so) this desktop publishing program for DOS. You can probably find a computer to run this program for free. Add a laser printer that emulates an HP Laserjet II or a dot-matrix printer and you'll be making newsletters, brochures or whatever. Many templates and clip-art...at 72 dpi, which is a bit jagged for our modern eyes. There were a few 300dpi fonts I could use with my laser printer plus the ability to use fonts built into it. Get a post-it stick. It makes any paper a Post-it, plus it is great for layout work. Instead of using low-res clip-art on-screen, cut it out or copy it from clip-art books, your own drawings or modern collections, manually paste the clip-art, cut-to-size on the ""master"" page using the post-it stick. It allows you to straighten-out the art and even change your mind.Take the ""master"" with clip-art and any extra items (pictures, logos, added text, etc) and photocopy it with a good copier. A paper cutter and scissors are good to have, plus white-out for removingimperfections on the page you copy. It was what I used for years to do lots of publishing work. Despite the limitations, it can't be beat for legacy desktop publishing if you mix computer andtraditional art/photo methods to do your layout. It has its own GUI. It was ahead of its time..WILL NOT RUN ON WINDOWS Vista or Windows 7 or XP. Best on machines running Dos 3.0 to Windows 3.11'That being said, if you church needs a snazzy newsletter but you just have a 10 year-old computer, no worries! This program runs fast on a 8 mhz XT with 640K RAM. a Hercules or EGA or VGA card are a must.CGA mode is worthless.The review before was accurate but the program is a bit better than you may expect. I used it in 1988 with an XT and a Tandy lp-1000 printer. At the time, the computer cost me $2000.00, the Laser printer $2000.00, the software with a logitech c-7 mouse for $200.00.

It's excellent. The tutorial walks you through the various application features by having you design a web page from a step by step simulation. You design the page on GoLive and see immediately if you're following the steps correctly. It's a lot easier than trying to figure things out yourself."

64425,1,I used to play this game when I was younger (around 6 or 7 I'm now 15) and I always thought it was weird but fun...I would recommend this for people looking for a good game for there kindergarden kids to play. Also If you have a 1st grader I recommend the version for 1st graders.
32211,1,"This is a good product for advanced users who want detailed control over what access to grant each application. The setup can be intimidating for novice users. Norton Personal Firewall is a better choice for casual users because the setup and use is much more automatic. ZoneAlarm gives those who want to tinker with the advanced settings easy access to do so.One downside: the included &quot;12 months of free updates&quot; does not equal one year of updates. You get 11 full months plus the remainder of the current month. Therefore, if you register your product on the 28th of a month, you get 11 full months + 3 days of the current month. I imagine you could wait until the first of a month to register your product to ensure you receive twelve full months, but I did not figure out ZoneAlarm's definition of &quot;twelve months&quot; until after I registered."
9471,1,This game is definatley one of the better created horse games. The graphics are fantastic and the riding is realistic. The game can be a little challenging at some points in the game and the dressage takes a little getting used to but other than that it is a great game. I was very happy with Champion Dreams and would reccoment it over the other horse games out there.
12281,1,"I have been fortunate enough to be a beta tester for this product, though I did not initially install the beta on my drive, after hearing about the &quot;activation&quot; clause. I won't get into that &quot;feature&quot; until the end, since it's the most talked aboutI have been a user of DOS, Windows 3.11, Windows 95, 98, and ME. My favorite OS, however, has been Windows 2000 Professional. After severe crashes, and abysmal memory management in 98 and Me, Win2000 provided a staple platform, which ran my most used applications (Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Office 2000, Flash 5) without a problem. It could be said that XP is the culmination of the best of WinME and Win2000.Now, I had never been a fan of the &quot;appearance&quot; of Windows, (Mac OS 9 - and 10- had the trophy for the most attractive GUI) but the look had grown a bit stale...until Windows XP.On installation, you notice that the beginning has a look of WinME - with it's installation wizard - but the second part of the installation looks like Windows 2000 - with it's DOS look. That is the end of the physical similarities.During the installation, it picked up all of my components with no problem, and had all of the drivers needed, including my Network card, and monitor. At first boot-up (which is about half the Windows 2000 wait on my Athlon 1.2Ghz), you notice an attractive boot splash screen, which then brings you to the first major feature:After setting up and selecting your profile, you come to the main screen. Built with a cleaner, highly customizable GUI, Windows XP can be either exciting for someone who loves to tweak, or a bit intimidating to those who don't (Be aware of that before going in).The start menu is different (though you can revert to the &quot;Classic&quot; style), in layout and function. It provides full access to the main parts you need. The requisite &quot;Start&quot; menu has been revised to include My Computer, Network Neighborhoods, and/or whatever else you may want. It's quite customizable.XP Useful features:Not built on the older DOS engine- Compatibility mode - allows setting programs, which may no be native to XP, to run in 95/98/ME/NT/2000 ""mode"". Great feature, and it has worked on all programs I have tried.- Enhanced battery life for laptops by:a) Lid Power. Display is shut down when ""lid"" (screen) is closed.b) LCD Dimming. When using battery power, the display is dimmed, and brightness is restored when plugged into AC.- Device driver rollback - a wonderful feature which allows you to ""roll-back"" to the previous driver, in case you have a conflict with your newly installed one. Allows beta-testing drivers.- Search Companion - much more advanced (and needed) search feature.- ClearType - much more precise and clean look for LCD and laptop displays. Also looks great on typical monitors.System Restore - carried over from WinME, this feature allows ""points"" to be created, in order to restore system setting in case you run into problems. Timesaving.- Completely re-designed GUI- Customized Desktops - allows multiple &quot;profiles&quot; to be set up (husband, wife, and kids for example) which retain settings for icon placement, wallpaper, icons shown, and more. This is great if one of you likes a cluttered (i.e. save everything to desktop J) desktop, and another likes a clean one. In my case, my wife doesn't want to see all of my icons for my programs, just the one little game she plays all the time. This feature gives XP some personality that has been missing.XP Fairly Useful Features:- CD Burning - Nice inclusion of basic CD burning capabilities, but it must be said, that ""basic"" means ""basic."" Not hybrid Mac/PC burns, no on-the-fly burning, VCD, etc. Get Nero 5.5.5.1 if you want great burning software.- Windows Messenger - MS answer to AOL Instant Messenger, allows quick connection to friends, and allows file trading. But it's also annoying. It takes a toll on the system resources, so you may find yourself disabling it (like I did ;-).- Self-contained Firewall - though not as robust as third-party ones (ZoneAlarm, Norton, etc.), it is adequate for most users.XP Misleading/Irritating Features:- DVD playback - this would be a nice feature...it existed. As it is, however, you need a third-party CODEC, in order to view DVDs.Microsoft Media Player - MP3 ripping/playing is relegated to 96-bitrate, due to ""protecting copyrights"" of CDs. You must get the Plus! Pack in order to do higher bitrate ripping. It's ironic that the WMA (Microsoft's own format) can be ripped to and played at higher bitrates.Stability:Anyone familiar with Windows 2000/NT, will be impressed with XP's stability. I have had to reboot only a couple of times, through the Beta and final versions, and then only due to my motherboard settings.Users of Win95/98/ME will be very happy to know that they will not have the conflicts/crashes which plagues those OSs.Compatibility info:Some of my Software (all but one worked with no problem)Photoshop 6Dreamweaver 4Fireworks 4Flash 5Cute FTP 1.0 ProNTI CDEasy Creator 5 Deluxe (Problem.

At age four, she is already becoming computer savvy, in part due to this game."
88736,1,This series is 1980's science fiction television at its worst. I gave it five stars because that's what I remembered and what I wanted it for. I place it in the same category as &#34;Megaforce&#34; from 1982. As the title says - it's so bad that it's good!!!
20965,1,"I love MasterCook and bought the new version to update what I already had and I also bought a copy to give as a gift. I like the fact that you can get the nutrition information for any recipe, you can print it in any format, and it's easy to share with others who also have MasterCook - not so easy to share with those who don't. I have found it easy to input and move around in the recipe options and I love the spell check feature. The only problem I have with this version is the ridiculously large box it comes in - the box seems to be only for advertising effect and is a waste of paper/aka trees."
17207,0,"Ok, folks.There's something truly wrong with the GoBack scene. Among the planted fake reviews, are some truly pleased people. On my old Win2000 machine, I was one. It ate YukkyWare by rolling back to before it existed. Done right, that's an amazing thing.I investigate some software options for my company. LUCKILY I bought GoBack with my OWN credit card, and decided to install it on a test basis in privacy. Norton doesn't install. ""Needs this much contiguous space."" Ok, I ran Start/Programs/Acessories/System Tools/Defragmenter TWICE.GoBack decides this is enough, and installs.BOOM! I too, met the dreaded BlackScreen. 6 Month old XP machine with basically nothing wrong. Unbelievable. The Downloaded version doesn't have a manual readily available (!) , so I had to get lucky to first disable, followed by Last Good Configuration, and then uninstall GoBack, with two reboots. Scary. I chose not to recommend this to my boss. :/I called Symantec (after wasting an hour with their information screen and technique of hiding support numbers.) Rep tells me ""maybe your hard drive has problems."" (You mean BEFORE, or AFTER installing GoBack?) Enough of Symantec Tech.So I turn off System restore, turn off 3/4 of the preloads, disable Norton Internet and Norton AntiVirus, and try again. Same BlackScreen. Disable GoBack, Last Good Configuration, Uninstall GoBack. Tried to look at the invoice I saved. The webpage contains Java elements. Internet explorer crashed so hard ""End Now"" ... didn't end it. Rebooted Windows.Right. I damn nearly annihilated my work computer. (I'd love to explain that one!)So I get this brilliant idea. ""Look! Since I nearly ruined my work computer, maybe it will work at home!!!!"" Drumroll....... Which it does. &lt;&lt; Smacks Forehead >>This is too much. So I went reseaching. See the amazon reviews. Someone BlackScreened on Win XP1, so it's not the infamous Destruction Pack 2. Someone reported a problem at the Bios level. (GoBack conflicts with OEM Bios installs?? GREAT.)Someone else mentioned Dell. The comp I nearly blew up was a dell. It works on an E-Machine.Network Connections? RAID drives? Wireless networks? Dell Proprietary software at the setup level? I don't have a $100,000 budget to do the research report with. Symantec seemed unimpressed when Windows wouldn't boot.

12205,1,"Windows XP gives you good compatibility, great security, and wonderful perfomance. The reason I picked 4 stars is because older programs do not work. But the benifits far outweigh the consequences. On the other hand, Linux crashes rarely, but it crashes completely."
12890,1,"I will have to say that Microsoft is moving the the right direction now. Windows 2000 was a huge leap in reliability and XP continues that drive. If you have old hardware then you may have problems with drivers, etc. If you can run Windows 2K ok then you should be fine with XP. I actually upgraded from 2K to XP and it worked fine, and I've been using since it was released. It is very stable and looks nice too. I am a software developer, so I purchased XP mainly to test and use for development. I'm no Microsoft zealot, but I've always considered 2000 to be the first &quot;almost&quot; real OS from Microsoft. I think that XP has now pushed them over the edge with it's increased reliability as well as the nice interface. If you computer is pretty up to date and your hardware is compatible you won't be disappointed with XP."

6498,0,"Interesting to read all the reviews not only here on this space but in the media across the country raving about this film as being one of the best comedies of the year. After waiting until it came out on DVD, expecting something spectacular, this viewer found the film disappointing. Writer/Director Lisa Cholodenko and writer Stuart Blumberg did not use the book by the same name as their source for the story, but rather turned to Cholodenko's personal experience with the topic at hand and though it was many years in 'gestation', the movie was shot in an unprecedented 23 days. So much for background.Nic (Annette Bening) is a hard working obsessive compulsive physician partnered with Jules (Julianne Moore), a free-floating, indecisive, career-frustrated landscape designer. The have two children - Joni (Mia Wasikowska) birthed by Nic and Laser (John Hutchenson) birthed by Jules - by the same sperm donor, Paul (Mark Ruffalo). There are the usual family tensions but the quartet seems fine until Joni and Laser decide they want to know their father. They uncover Paul who is into organic food delivery service and relate to him and he to them. When Nic and Jules discover the mission their kids have been on they feel their family has been disrupted. Further developments occur that drive the wedge between the moms close to dissolution but of course that is overcome by the coming together of Joni's leaving for college.All this could be OK, but for this viewer the prejudices about same sex marriage are not championed but instead are placed in a negative light. Infidelity is just that and the problems don't stop there: offensive racial slurs occur when the embarrassed Jules fires gardener Luis (Joaqu&iacute;n Garrido) for no reason and Paul's idea of a family man excludes the possibility of marrying the very beautiful African American Tanya (Yaya DaCosta), etc. The crisis of the story should not be shared as it is the only quasi-surprise in the film - and even that seems like a put down to the position of women. Bening and Moore look old, tired and crotchety but give good performances to the characters as they are written. Ruffalo is being touted as an Oscar nominee for his role, but the role is a mirror of all his other work. If there are winners here they are Wasikowski and Hutchenson - fresh and credible. Great expectations, minimal return. Grady Harp, November 10"
40501,1,"The idea of stolen diamonds immediately lured me to this novel. I am just now being formally introduced to the suspense of award-winning author Nora Roberts. Quite frankly, I am thoroughly impressed with the talent of this very fine writer who has meticulously crafted a wonderful story. The characters are all amazingly real. Roberts manipulates time-lapses exceptionally well; this can be very tricky. I'm convinced that I have to read the other works in her series.Highly Recommended Read!"
94375,1,This was so easy to use. It was fast and pain free. The rebate was nice too!I will buy it again next year.
66297,1,"This is a must have for any hulk fan! Yeah, some of the reviewers might complain about the quality of the scans, but it is a very minor issue, and overall an incredible (no pun intended) compilation of the comics. Also, I really like the fact that they scanned the entire book, advertisements and all. It gives you a sense of the times in which they were published. Pick this up, you won't be disappointed!"
63508,0,"I've been interested in learning another language for some time. Back in high school and college, my foreign language experiences (French and German) were disappointing. Mostly my fault. Now that I'm in my sixties, I thought I'd try again. I had looked at more expensive products, but I'm not ready to spring for that kind of money. The reviews I read on Amazon for the Berlitz product sounding promising, so I thought I'd try it.My fairly new laptop is a Vista (Home Premium) based machine so I checked to make sure this product would run under Vista before I purchased it. It says it does, and, in fact it does, but you need a whip and a chair to get it installed. Each time I launched the install process, it would hang-up just before the end of the process. All the files installed, but no desktop icon and the product would not launch. After several tries, I emailed the support box at Nova. They responded promptly. Before you install, run msconfig and modify the startup process so no other startup items are loaded. Now run the install process again. It runs through and works correctly. In the email, they did not mention the fact that there is a general Vista patch on the Nova web site for all the Berlitz Premier language products. Once you get the install complete, go to the Nova site and run the patch as well. You're good to go!I guess, more to the point, is this a good product to learn Spanish? I think it is. It provides many approaches for you to do the needful (read the manual before you start). It includes CDs that you can use in your car. There videos that help you put the language into context. I know some of the reviews complain about the accent of the speakers. I can't speak to that point since I have no real experience. I could end up speaking Spanish badly with a strange New England accent, but I'll be speaking Spanish!I think I have gotten fair value for my money. No more, no less."
2662,1,I used an old PC with Windows 98. This program was easy and quick. If you have a simple will or trust that is basic then this should save you much time and expense. It asks questions and I was able to make a living trust in about 15 minutes of which 99% of the legal speak is preformatted and has been carefully reviewed. The program gives all of the information on what to do after a will or trust has been made to finalize it. I am very pleased with it and glad I did not pay a lawyer $1000 to type the information into his computer program that does the same thing.

45348,0,"I got this for my husband so he could spend more time editing his videos at home than the 3 hours a week at a studio. He's mostly happy with Pinnacle; this version is an upgrade from the one he uses at the studio. The only problem is that for a mid-range consumer program, it hogs a lot of resources. We have to kill all processes that don't involve running the operating system (antivirus, firewall, startup programs, Internet)- basically one step up from safe mode. If we don't the software locks everything up.It also took a little trial and error to get it actually get it installed. We updated the software immediately as others suggested. Otherwise, we got what we wanted, considering it was under $100."

57489,0,"Trend Micro Internet Security 2006There are many good points to this software - The virus and firewall components are exceptional. He firewall in particular allows complete flexibility to allow/deny incoming/outgoing TCP/UDP/ALL from Any application to any port to any IP that seeks external connectivity. As with all firewall you do need some understanding of the protocol.On the bad side - You would be very much better of with the 2005 version Unless you have at least a P4 and 1GIG of RAM - You don't get net bells and whistles for nothing and this application WILL (if you have the basic system requirements) fall over on you regularly, particularly TMProxy.exe and the inbuilt scheduler will not perform ANY tasks. You PC will crash as it runs out of resources as they are gobbled up.The application WILL fall over unless you update the definitions before launching into configuring it for the first time. The first time update of configuration will ask you to re-boot. Under NO circumstances should you continue to configure the application as it WILL fall over to a debug screen.The Anti-spam add-in for outlook and outlook express is very heave on system resources. If you install this add-in, and it's a good one as updates, false positives, are action very quickly be trend Micro and you Anti-Spam definition criteria will each day become more tailored to your every situation of one or two false positives - you must update this add-in each day however.The biggest improvement is the privacy protection, which is wizard driven and has a direct interface to you browser that is exceptional. Fraudulent sites ARE identified and warning given that a site may not be who their URL claims it to be.By far the most disappointing feature is the password protection. It protects all aspects of the configuration EXCEPT the firewall component. I have seen three cases where an intruder has gained access to a PC and removed ALL the information in the firewall configuration as it is not protected by password. This is an acute failing of the product, which was present in 2005 and unbelievably NOT fixed in 2006.This Product IS very good, however you need a min of 1 GIG of RAM and a P4 2.0GHz Minimum.If you activate the home Network Function you network will be flooded with NetBIOS Port 137 Requests to control the feature.For all the improvements and for all the demands on resources you are far better off with the 2005 version. We don't all have endless RAM and Processor power to spare and if you are like most in running several security resident programs - non of us can spare anything.With the release of Windows Vista slated for release late in 2006, this application will not function on the new platform. Instead Trend Micro has made this application backward compatible supporting previous version of Windows - which is hard to find"
39436,1,To briefly re-state what the previous reviews have correctly stated:1) Much better than the competition. I've tried them.2) Has all the features 'that you would probably really use' of the high end programs. It is the same as Sony Vegas with a couple of the features that most people would never use chopped out. A couple of the messages still say 'Vegas' in them.3) Very stable. Has never crashed over multiple large projects4) You are easily able to take out or lower the volume on a little part of the sound track (if there is an unwanted sound or somebody says a few words that you want to take out).5) It comes with Sonic MyDVD which is a piece of junk but it does work if you want ugly menus. The latest CD version of Screenblast 3.0 comes with MyDVD 5.23 which is the newest version of MyDVD as of today! Earlier reviews said that their Screenblast came with MyDVD 4.5 which is not true anymore.**An earlier Amazon reviewer gave this product 1 star because they said: If you take out a picture then you have to move all of the pictures after it manually to fill the hole. That is not true! Just turn on 'Ripple Edit' and everything moves over by itself.Another reviewer said it was not stable. Those people need to fix their computers. In my experience (and according to all of the reviews around the internet) this is a rock solid stable program with no crashes.I have not needed customer service for this program but I think that Sony customer service stinks for their other products but that is another story that doesn't go with this review.
74645,1,I've been using Quicken for at least 10-15 yrs. I have no business relationship to Intuit other than being a long time user of TurboTax and Quicken. I've read all the negative comments about Quicken 2005 and am very surprised. I've been using 2005 Business & Premier for 2-3 yrs and have had no problems after upgrading from earlier version. It's a great program. Works perfectly. I'm a little disappointed that Quicken is making me upgrade to 2008 shortly due to lack of on-line download support. But I'll pay for the upgrade because of the overwhelming value I get from Quicken.
9690,1,"Jimmy Dean's grandpa said it years ago, and it's true here too. The only serious negative I have found with Reunion 9 is it's cost, but ""you sometimes get what you pay for."" It was true with Jimmy Dean's sausage and it's true with genealogy software for the Mac. After I got over the pain in my pocket book, it's been wonderful ever since. Go ahead, you know you want it. Get it.Like many folks, I came from the Darkside and started with Family Origins, switched to Family Tree Maker, didn't like it and went back to FO, then when FO sold the farm to FTM, I changed to PAF. On coming to the Lightside, I started looking for Mac genealogy and tried about everything out there that didn't cost $100. I tried all I could find including Ohana's new product that lock steps with New Family Search. I tried them and finally bit the credit card and bought Reunion, and I haven't had an unhappy moment since.I have used Reunion an average of eight hours a day for the past month, and the only time I communicated with anyone was to see if I had missed being able make entries in Pedigree format. I hadn't, all entry is done in Family view, but there is an Overview feature that provides a pedigree view from where you are in your tree, and you can double-click on a person in Overview and it takes you right to the Family card.As far as having to communicate with anyone regarding how to do anything, including highly technical stuff, I haven't needed to, the Manual is that good.Five stars, folks. Quit wasting your time and buy it. If you are not convinced, download a trial copy and check it out for yourself. I did that, but I purchased it form Amazon because I like the way they do business."
5914,2,"I used TurboTax for the past two years. After reading the review about TaxCut, got fooled to buy this product.My wife has only Tax Payer ID (TIN), with that the state program didn't start to work and complained SSN is not correct! Customer service says update the latest from the website, looks like standard answer, that doesn't solve the problem. They never tested this simple thing I guess. Finally I found a workaround, enter some random SSN number for my wife and proceed to State program and then come back and change the SSN. What the heck? Then what about any complex calculations? How can you be sure that it has been tested?I crosschecked my tax calculations manually to make sure it matches before e-filing. Good news is I got the refund in 8 days, a big relief to me.I'll going back to TurboTax, no doubt."

35924,0,"The ads said &quot;every map ever published for the Forgotten Realms&quot;. Not even close.The tiling of the smaller scale maps means that some key areas overlap two maps, thus making it impractical to impossible to implement some of the smaller scale published maps in the current product format.On the other hand, the maps they do have are gorgeous. And the globe feature is nice, though they would have been better off to do regional maps to match the regions on the globe exactly rather than try for the adjoining rectangular maps. (So what if there's overlap in the regional maps? That's how real-world maps work - they map relevant regions and don't worry about, or account for, overlap.)Overall, a decent version 1.0 proof-of-concept. Next time out, if the lessons are learned from this time, should be spectacular."
88119,1,"I purchased this program in hopes of getting an inexpensive tax preparation program that would get me the biggest return possible. I was tired of going to tax prep places and paying an outrageous fee for something that I could do on my own. I was very pleased with this program!The format is very straight-forward, and thorough. It takes you through an interview process that calculates your return at the top of the screen as you progress. I found no glitches or download problems with this program whatsoever. Also, being a single father, Tax Act helped me get the biggest return I have ever received! Tax Act also emails you when the IRS has received and is reviewing your return.I will certainly be using this program to do my 2001 yr taxes. Kudos to The Learning Company for such a fine product.It will save you a lot of money in tax preparation, and, as in my case, will help you get the best return possible."

There are like 7 Missions which is disappointing. And the although the pools are cool, there's really a limited amount of stuff you can make. Pools? check. Stairs? Check. Lounge chairs? Check. but besides the basic pool items, this thing lacks much content. I mean there's what, 4 styles of slides? overall, it's a good game but nothing great like the original or Wild!"
76755,0,"I purchased the download version of this direct from Garmin, which was explained as being the same thing. So here's a newsflash for Garmin: The Balearic Islands - Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, etc. - ARE PART OF SPAIN and have been since the Greeks and Romans were there. One of my destinations in Spain was to Mallorca, and guess what my Garmin GPS showed? I was in the middle of water. The Mediterranean surrounded me, no land anywhere. The Garmin was therefore completely useless. Not that the large island was difficult to manage, but it could have saved me a one hour detour and a few other navigational headaches.On the mainland it worked more or less fine. Always a good idea to keep a detailed map with you, though, because the GPS directions can be off at times. Best points: Generally very helpful in big cities. E.g., I had a Sixt rental car, and I was instructed to return it to ""Atocha"" in Madrid. If someone just says ""Atocha,"" it means (1) the large train station on the southeast side of the city or (2) Atocha street, a nearby large road running up the hill of the old part of the city. The car return location which the German company had designated as ""Atocha"" was a not well marked basement garage with a narrow, forbidding opening beneath a hotel off a very small plaza in an area of winding and twisting streets a long way from anything resembling ""Atocha"". I had to call the Sixt help line, get the actual address and plug it into the GPS to navigate my way there. (That's another hint for travelling in Spain: buy a $20 cell phone with pay by the minute card installed which you can add minutes to at just about every gas station, roadside restaurant or kiosks located all over the large cities.)This GPS was also helpful while on the road, especially with a Michelin in hand: Look up out of the way restaurants, then cross check with the GPS's data base of restaurants, then hit ""go"". It got me to a way cool 18th century farmhouse cum Michelin recommended restaurant in a semi-rural area which no way would I have found otherwise.I would have given four stars, but three since the product is misrepresented. It is NOT complete for all of Spain when it entirely leaves out the very popular and beautiful Balearics. I'm guessing that the Canary Islands are also not included. Garmin needs to disclose those deficiencies."
75268,0,Indesign CS3 is by far the superior layout software on the market. The reason for my poor rating is Adobe's poor customer service. 3 hours spent on the phone being passed around from department to department trying to resolve a licensing issue. Ridiculous.

10511,1,Director 8.5 is the best thing that has happened for a while. It will help me so much on my game making and it is helpful for other stuff like animations. With its new 3D part you are able to import 3D models and use them in your score. With the 3D models you can create easy 3D games. It is worth getting and has changed Director totally. comparing them from the older versions it is alot better and because you can upgrade it from Director 6 to 8.5 it just shows how Macromedia are the best. Thanks everyone who helped to make it.

88863,1,"It WAS an event! To have this type of production value on TV was a big thing back then..no computers or cgi digitizing! Anyway...for us Sci Fi fans...it was like a candy trip to a 7-11 with about $5 back in the day.But I didn't see many reviews about ""Diana""..who was probably THE most interesting of characters. A kind of ""female Hitler up-and-coming"".I remember when it was found out about us being the FOOD! Man..it was the TALK at school!!!But also, the young girl that falls in love with the ""alien"" and get's pregnant...she was supposed to be played by Dominique Dunne who was the older sister in Poltergeist..unfortunately, after her first few takes on ""V"" she was murdered by her jealous boyfriend. If you look for one of the first shots of the spacecraft appearing over the cities, you can see Dominique in that wide shot when the neighborhood folk come out and looks up.I'm sorry..but for the series acting, writing, concept and ideology of fighting against oppression..this series IS the bomb!!!!The commentary by the first director is also fantastic. He talks about how the fighting against oppression in South Africa, at the time, sparked a wave of RED ""V""s to be painted as a symbol against that oppression...and that was halfway around the world and to the south. Most people did not understand the global impact of it's deep rooted human meaning and power. It was adopted all over.I often wondered about the movie ""V"" for Vendetta...there was very much a similar tone. Another one of my faves! I think we all need a little ""V"" in our life..to balance the damage that has been done to country and brotherhood."

64131,1,"Before I bought this product I found it difficult to find reviews of Nat. Geographic topo state software as well as MapTech Terrain Navigator software, so I am giving this input for future customers. MapTech provides a demo. I'd say I prefer MapTech's 3D to Nat. Geographic's 3D version. Nat. Geographic provides more features such as greater grid spacing options. But don't expect either to print with the resolution of the regular 1:24,000 USGS maps; both software brands have to default to a larger scale to get that kind of resolution and clarity at least with ink jet printers. National Geographic Topo's 50% default setting results in an approximate print scale of 1:31,000 which results in very good clarity. However even at 1:24,000 they are legible (although a bit fuzzy). They will both save you money verses buying the regular topo maps (after 20 or so store-bought maps considering your ink and paper costs) plus they give you advantages if you use a gps unit especially in overlaying grids, trail markers, etc., on the printed-out maps. But don't forget it takes more than (4) 8 1/2"" x 11"" printouts to match one regular store bought 1:24,000 topo map."

I also had no problem opening ms office files, except that there were sometimes formatting &amp; formula issues, but ms office however would not even open star office files. Having said that I welcome any improvement, enhancement and upgrade to the 6.0 versionI moved to Canada and I'm surprised that we cannot find Star office suite here.

73089,0,"ACDSee 5.0.1.006 is a powerful, but crash-prone (at least on the two Windows XP Home SP1 / NTFS systems that I use) consumer-oriented digital imaging manager. ACDSee PowerPack bundles the base ACDSee 5.0 image manager with FotoCanvas 2.0, an image editor; and FotoAngelo, a slideshow and screensaver generator. Compared with rival Adobe Photoshop Album, ACDSee is focused on file-level manipulation and organizational processes, while Photoshop Album is more focused on creative projects. Consumers that primarily want to *use* their photographs to create calendars, photo books, video CDs, greeting cards, e-cards, etc., should purchase Photoshop Album. ACDSee PowerPack does not have tools for these sorts of projects. Consumers that place importance on metadata should also consider ThumbsPlus 6.0.(Consumers should beware the trial version of Adobe PhotoShop Album. The trial version installs Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.1, but is then unable to uninstall Acrobat Reader, which has since been surpassed by Adobe Reader 6.0.)It is in the use of ACDSee that one acquires an appreciation of the program's file-level management and organizational facilities. Although ACDSee's interface may look complicated at first, its design enables one to manipulate multiple files quickly. Photoshop Album is less skilled at file-level management in part because it abstracts collections of images into a catalog-based user interface. ACDSee's small touches may be easy to overlook, but are appreciated when compared to other programs. CompuPic Pro 6.22, for example, allows Shift-Click mouse operations to select multiple files, but omits ACDSee's keyboard support for similar operations.Support for metadata in an image manager is important. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but not always. Without aid, the casual viewer may not understand a picture's content or context. (E.g., What is this a picture of? Who are these people? What the (blank) was I drinking..?!) Even the photographer himself may not remember these things himself ten or twenty years later. Metadata helps by capturing camera setting information and providing a way to embed picture caption information inside the picture itself.ACDSee does a fair job of supporting metadata. ACDSee can read all, and edit selected (but not all) EXIF metadata fields present in a picture, but cannot add EXIF metadata to a picture if those metadata fields are absent from the picture (i.e, scanned pictures). The program also uses an internal database to store notes up to 4,000 characters, keywords up to 1,000 characters, and category information about pictures. While ACDSee's batch operations support the addition of keywords, category, and database information (these are all to the ACDSee internal database), batch support does not extend to EXIF metadata editing operations.ACDSee unfortunately does not support the more useful IPTC and XMP metadata standards. (For example, the online photo sharing site Fotki.com automatically displays IPTC title and caption information.) Users with files with IPTC metadata will have to take care in using ACDSee. While ACDSee JPEG filters are IPTC-aware, the program's TIFF filters are not. ACDSee's TIFF filters have a bug - adding EXIF metadata to an 8-bit grayscale TIFF image will mangle the image with some sort of Emboss effect.Most of ACDSee's competitors do worse at supporting metadata. Photoshop Album truncates metadata caption text to 63 characters, and limits internal database entries to 1,000 characters. CompuPic Pro 6.22 can only read (but not edit) EXIF metadata, and does not have internal notes or keywords facilities. Picasa uses EXIF datestamps to only sort images. ACDSee users can supplement ACDSee's metadata capabilities with freeware programs like Exifer (http://www.exifer.friedemann.info), a EXIF and IPTC metadata editor; and PixVue (http://www.pixvue.com) , a freeware Windows Explorer extension that provides IPTC/XMP metadata handling capabilities. ThumbsPlus 6.0 is a notable exception, supporting both EXIF and IPTC metadata. However, ThumbsPlus' interface is less adept than ACDSee's interface, and not have a Calendar view.ACD FotoCanvas 2.0 and ACD FotoAngelo 2.0 are very basic programs not worth the extra cost. One would almost be better-off saving money towards the purchase of Photoshop Elements (or Paint Shop Pro) and ProShow, respectively. FotoAngelo's output options are limited to Microsoft Windows executable (.EXE) files and screensaver (.SCR) files. Users that want to share their memories with a wider audience will have to go elsewhere to create video CD's. While FotoAngelo supports captioning, caption text import from embedded metadata (EXIF, IPTC, or XMP) and ACDSee's internal database are all unsupported, so caption text must be manually entered for each image in the show.As a basic image editor, FotoCanvas is on par with the very basic Microsoft Photo Editor that has shipped with Microsoft Office for several years. The base ACDSee product itself has a far better image rotate tool than FotoCanvas, which splits the tool in two: Rotate and Flip. FotoCanvas, however, does have a far better Crop tool than Adobe Photoshop Elements. FotoCanvas also supports Adobe PhotoShop plug-ins."

59737,0,"Microsoft makes the best office suite - period. However, I still do believe that the price is a bit of a rip-off. I have been using Open Office (...) which is developed by Sun Microsystems and is FREE. It is also compatible with MS Office - you can save the files in Word, PowerPoint etc. format. The more I use it, the more I wish I had it during my undergrad days. If money is not your concern - MS Office is definitely the best productivity suite out there. However, if you are a student and wish to make presentations or documents for school/university work I would definitely recommend Open Office as you simply cannot get anything better for free and it shall suit all your needs. I mean at the end of the day - you are graded on your work now how the slides come flying in. But Open has the flying slides too - thought the MS ones still look cooler:) I particularly liked exporting Word Files to PDF format within Open Office. For the record I am not anti-Microsoft - they have some good products - I just wish they would make them more affordable. I hope this helps."
73205,1,"As being the novice in screenwriting, I was originally going to use MSWord to try to format my script. However, after purchasing a couple of screenwriting reference books, I realized that formatting isn't an easy task. A writer would take more time trying to format the document rather than focusing on the creation of the script.After thoroughly researching a variety of programs, I settled on this one. I find it easy to use. Everything is already set up for me...all I have to do is type. I also like the text to speech feature. All thought the voices sound robotic, I am still able to visualize if what I am writing makes any sense aloud. I am also able to catch little mistakes like if I forgot to type an ""a"" or a ""the"".This program is also formatted for novels, tv scripts and stage plays. Therefore, at this price, I think it's a GREAT deal. However, if you are a student you can get the academic price of $90 from the Academic Superstore, but you must show proof of currently being enrolled in school. See http://www.academicsuperstore.com/eligibility.html for requirements of eligibility.I am sure there are other programs that are just as user friendly or not, however I think the key thing as a writer is to just find a product that is going to WORK FOR YOU! That one program that you are going to feel most comfortable in creating your document. That is the most important element...find something that works for you as a writer and if at any time that product is no longer accommodating your needs then you have the choice to switch."

86605,0,"While its basic speech recognition is fine for creating written documents, if you plan on using this for any other application, specifically Outlook and Mozilla Firefox, it just plain doesn't work very well.If you use Internet Explorer (Allah forbid) you get most of the nice little web browsing features like being able to toggle distinct labels for all text or image links, and a little cursor that shows you where it's clicking for you. In Firefox these things are nowhere to be seen. Despite the claim to support Firefox in the PR I'd love to know what they think works.Outlook is another problem application. There are supposed to be generic commands that work for most email apps and most of these commands fall on deaf ears in Outlook. Never mind that the window for composing an email message in Outlook is very non-standard and does not behave well with DNS.Oy. I'm disappointed.[edit]I've since learned that the standard version does not support Outlook 2003. It is still possible to get around using keyboard shortcuts but it's not ideal.As for Firefox, I've been saved by an extension called Mouseless. It pops up little numbers next to anything on a webpage that you can possibly click, then you just say the number of the item you want to click. Again not ideal but it will suffice. It seems the truly whiz-bang features are still reserved for Internet Explorer (unfortunate indeed)."
41293,0,"I upgraded a 5+ year old computer to a new one. Both are running XP and both are Dells. Like most people, one of the main reasons I kept the old computer was the hassel of upgrading.I was hoping this product would make the process much easier.While PC Relocator did a good job of moving my settings, email, cookies and so on, I still had to reinstall a lot of my software. It was amazingly slow using the included USB cable - don't even try it if you have a home network - use the network (turn firewalls off). I started using the USB because it looked simpler but when it told me it would take over 65 hours, I cancelled and started over with the network. That was much faster (5 hours) but it still choked. Finally I reduced the number of files (I can copy them without this program) and it ran quickly (under 2 hours). But still I had to reinstall many of my programs, which is what I was trying to avoid.Overall, I figure this product saved me about 40% of the time I would have spent without it. I may have not been able to move everything as efficiently as it did. It did not, however, deliver what I was hoping for - a fairly seamless transition.Full disclosure - my old computer had 4 partitions and the new one has only one (and, for simplicity I wanted to keep it that way). I used the Expert mode, which allows you to change the drive your programs will install on (was on D, will be on C). If you have a simpler set up - especially the same number of partitions on both machines - it might work better since I think the reason I had problems had to do with file locations - they couldn't find their .dlls and other supporting files.Bottom line - having this product was better than not having it for me but I still have a lot of work to do to fully enjoy my new XPS 400."
75884,0,"I've been working with Poser 6 for a while, I finally decided to make the leap to Poser 7.Intalled it. Started the program. And CRASH! I don't mean an application ""not responding"" message. I mean a total system crash. My PC needed a hard reboot (cut the power reboot). I found the service pack 1 on the efrontiers website. Installed it. Opened the program again. CRASH.After spending $180 for the program, I decided it was worth one more try. Started the program. This time I figured out the system seizure happened when I moved the mouse cursor over the document window. Reboot again. Avoiding the document, I ran my mouse cursor over the top menu, Deleted Figure. The default loaded Simon. Once Simon was gone, I was able to work for a little while.Addendum 4/18/2007Other disappointments with the program:One of Poser's Features is the Face Room.The kids' figures are not compatible with the face room, which is a total shame.The Cloth room is very complicated to learn how to use. Using the program's documentation, plus buying two User Guides, I haven't been able to make cloth. But I could be exceptionally dense.Head paramater dials don't include ears. Only Judy, carried forward from Poser 5, lets you shape elf ears.Action poses and their back geometries. I loaded James into my project, and posed him with one of his action presets. Something really unnatural looking happens to his back.Addendum May 25, 2007:I worked for several hours without crashing. The new feature in Poser7 is the Undo option. By default, the software sets the Undo level to 100. After changing the Undo level preference to 3, so far so good!Addendum June 26, 2007:Service Pack 2 is now available for the program. I've been able to work without a PC crash, I'm feeling better about having spent the money for the software.The community supporting this software is surprisingly friendly, and global. I've posted numerous questions on the Content Paradise Forum website, and almost always received an answer, if not a friendly bit of encouragement.It's like playing with paperdolls. You can buy shoes, dress, lingerie, sets, and scenery, props, etc.To achieve commercial grade results, you'll need to read the Poser Manual from cover to cover. Plus, Poser doesn't include a modeller or UV Mapper, you'll need extra software if you want to tailor results to your needs.Cheers,Lara"
74870,1,"This is a good program for those who want to make some pretty cool websites. I wasn't expecting much because I just wasn't. I use Director 8.5 for animating 2D fun stuff.The Good:1. It's very easy and comes with a lot of built in features such as fade in and fade out.2. The timeline is like a score if you use Director.3. It's very simple and easy to master.4. Thank God you don't need to script in any computer language.5. You can easily do tons of stuff at once.Now for the bad:1. I'm used to dragging the item not seeng a see through version of the characters (cast). I can't stand that when you click straight that it shows the transparent version right on top of the original.2. You can't drag your pictures to the background area or use them as backgrounds.3. There is no proberties option to make something Matte or Transparent etc. option like in Director when you're animating. So when ever you draw something in a program like paint it comes out when you try dragging it on the screen to be bordered in white.So the goods out do the bads so I took away one star. It's still a fine program, but with some annoying options that are clearly not in there. I reccomend this to people who want to make a website quickly in a short time.Director is a very good animating program and you can do a lot more stuff in it with animating. It says on the Motionartist box ""Flash animation in minutes"" which is true when you think about it, but it is not a serious animating program like making flash movies for the internet. Oh yeah this is also pretty good for making presentations too."

3611,1,Usually I find that installation of big programs can be a pain since Windows is not the best operating system. However I downloaded the software and installed it without problems. The menus came up and the features worked instantly.Photo editing is so much better that I hardly recognize the program from version 7. It nearly mirrors standalone programs.So far I haven't found anything else that has as many features. It is also the most accessible program I've tried in this genre.

69416,1,"I was surprised to see negative reviews on this product..and especially surprised to see that some thought they needed special ink to print the checks. I have been using VersaCheck products for over 10 years and have never one time had any problem printing my checks on my inkjet printer. Until just recently I was doing bookkeeping for small businesses and printed all the checks for my clients. They loved it. Even though I did charge them, the fee was nominal compared to what they had to pay their banks or other check printing companies to print their checks.I still use the versachecks for our own personal checking accounts. Ordering through Amazon saves you big money as compared to ordering directly from G7 or from Office Depot or the like.In my opinion, this is a wonderful and very helpful product. Don't let the negative reviews cheat you out of trying a great product."

It will save you time, and aggravation !I have used every other accounting software package out there, and I really just recommend QBooks for most businesses. It's functionality, ease of use and reporting functions are GREAT!. I have all my clients up and running with deposits, checks, invoices, emailing statements, job profitabilities etc etc.within 2 hours WHEN it's been set up properly !I have taken many clients off other software out there in the market that has cost them many lost hours, wasted money and MUCH frustration.

I think they should've got someone else to do the job because he just didn't cut it.

67349,1,This software is very easy to use! I lost the original disk when I bought my new computer. I went out and bought the Punch Home Design Platinum! Although 3D Home Architect is outdated it is still better! The NEED to KNOW is that the new Windows 2000 and newer DO NOT have a driver called d3drm.dll to run the software. This is very easy to fix...you can download the driver for free online. Once you download the driver move it to windows/system32. DO THIS BEFORE INSTALLING CD-ROM and everything will be fine! AGAIN THIS IS VERY EASY TO DO! ENJOY
19134,0,"Overall, it is a useful SD card but it does have some serious flaws. I am presently using it in France and at times I just don't know where to go: the information given by a ""synthetic"" voice is imprecise or does not match the map. Some roads, although not recently built, are missing. For very short distances, the information is wrong: for example, it says ""sortir dans 400 m&egrave;tres"" when the real distance is only ""200 m&egrave;tres"". (I found later on that if you choose a ""real"" French Canadian female voice, the info is much better!)Still, for the price Garmin charges, it should provide a better software;When I use my Garmin N&uuml;vi 350 in the US, it works flawlessly all the time.

73159,1,This is the best verison of RedHat Linux out there. It's very easy and straightforward to use you have to use fdisk if you got the infamous over 1024 cylinder limit. But the good news is that This verison of RedHat has a special verison of LILO [linux boot loader] that works with Windoze ME so you can use both. It's graphical and all around easy. This verison has the new kernal 2.4 and the new KDE 2.0 also it has this new file navigator called nautilous by Eazeal and is really stright forward. The only thing is is that it's only in the GNOME desktop [like Mac OS][one of the 2 GUI graphical user interfaces that linux has] Plus if you want to listen to sound in GNOME you have to login as root and turn the sound on and restart. The other thing is win your installing linux using fdisk when you have to name your windows partitons the monut just type /mnt/win It's stright forward. I havnt gotten to have previous good linux experiences because I have a new computer and linux wouldn't reconize my cable modem or sound card but this one Does therefore it's the only one I use.

AND IT DOESN'T CRASH!!!!!Oh, and as far as support from Pinnacle, don't even think of it...you're on your own. They'll take your money for a sale, but don't expect any useful (if any) help from them. Sony on the other hand was all over me to help get their program running. Never looking back. Pinnacle had a cool concept, but as another reviewer said -- how does a company get to release 10 and still have a crappy product?????? Vegas is at release 6.0 and it's ROCK SOLID - has not crashed ONCE since i've owned it."
1760,1,"I have tried several other GPS programs - and this is by far the best out there in my opinion! Perfect directions, fast to redirect you, lets you know about construction... it has saved me time quite a few times! I tried a handheld GPS and the main difference is that the Microsoft Locator is just much more powerful than the handhelds I have tried. I don't have to stop the car to locate a satelite if I turn it on while I am driving. The Microsoft GPS Locator can find a satelite as I'm driving down the road! Obviously the fact that you need it connected to a PC is not as convenient as carrying a smaller handheld device but I usually have my laptop in the car anyway. On long trips we watch DVD's on the laptop and the GPS simply runs in the background. I would definitely recommend this for long trips. For running around a city, having to open up my laptop is not quite as convenient... but you can't beat the price for a GPS!"
52499,0,"As a longtime user of Quicken, I found Money to be an adequate replacement. Quicken has become more and more &quot;advertisement-centered,&quot; which is more than a small annoyance when I paid for the software and not the ads.Money also includes advertisements, but to a much lesser degree. Some of the advertisements are blatant (for financial services) and some are more subtle (check your stocks!).What I least enjoyed about Money is the &quot;dummy&quot; factor: they literally walk you through everything, and have voice help prompts. You can turn off these features, but you have to search the help files to find out how, as they're not readily available. I think it would be a good idea for software programs to offer two 'start-up' options: one for experienced financial software users and one for beginners.My favorite feature of Money is the ease of importing financial information from online services. If you have an American Express card for both yourself and your spouse, you know that Amex assigns two separate card numbers. With Quicken, I would have to manually change the account numbers before downloading the statements for the card; Money allows you to match a download with an existing account, even if the numbers don't match. I also found that Money will import my bank's online statement feature, whereas Quicken would not accomplish this task.Money is a bit different from Quicken - some features are easy to use and some are more difficult or less user-friendly. Keep in mind that no two financial programs are the same when making the transition."

Whether you're a novice or professional, you can produce still images and QuickTime movies in just about any category (product design, a model for sculpting, greeting cards, Desktop picture, make your own adventure games, etc.). You can even visit the NASA web site, download a top-down image of Mars, import it into Carrara and have it apply this image to a ""Terrain"" object. This will produce a 3D model of that grayscale image. Now you'll be able to move your Carrara camera through this alien landscape and see what it would be like to actually stand on Mars! You can also animate the camera to fly over your Martian terrain and create a QuickTime movie.Over 900 ready-made models are included, which you can always modify, and you can create just about anything you can image.I have written an in-depth review of this program, complete with example images and QuickTime movies. However, it's way too large to post here at Amazon. I wrote this for our local Macintosh user's group -- M.A.C.S. (Macintosh Asheville Computer Society).

24987,1,great game.....its really fun to play this game with other people on Gamespy...because you can meet people from other parts of the world who love to play the same game as you do.....its a must buy...Bought it for 11 dollars tho...just don't play with the PC alone....that's boring no matter how the game creator made it....
67938,2,"I purchased the software for my small business with the intention of upgrading from quick books.The Peachtree software states it can convert data from a quick books file. I had numerous problems with this feature, leading to 3 calls to technical support which took way too long to resolve. I was on hold for at least 25 minutes for each call before someone answered my call.This combined with the fact that you only get a paltry 30 days of tech support before the company tries to sell you a service support plan shows an utter lack of regard for providing a quality product for customers.My data would not fully convert because I opted for the cash accounting method when using quick books, and peachtree requires a 4 digit account number for every blessed account and sub account and sub account of a subaccount.In short, the program is too rigid and can't be customized to give me what I want in an accounting platform. Service was lousy--after a cumulative 2 hours on hold or on the phone with a support rep the problems were not resolved.I recommend against this software!"

36348,1,"This product is great in helping me brush up on my Swahili. It's fun &amp; motivating to go through (rather than just trying to do little book exercises &amp; never know if you're right or wrong). It's a great way to learn if you don't have an instructor to give feedback.Only problems are: the pronunciation check fails pretty often -- either it doesn't create a voice print for the native speaker, or it doesn't stop recording after I finish speaking the phrase, so I get no information on how close my pronunciation was. I end up doing the same phrases over and over trying to get it to work correctly (I guess I get practice, though!)I'm also not sure how easy it would be for someone with no knowledge of Swahili to learn the grammar this way. It is very different from English and I think a little instruction on the nature of the grammar would help a lot. I find that I look up some words in the dictionary to be sure when they mean as I am going along. For most examples, though, it is clear."
58895,1,"This is truly the best one in the series. If you like basketball you will love basketball. I love basketball , so I love it. The weirdest part and probably the best is that the kids can dunk. How many 6-12 year olds do you know do that? The power-ups are very cool. You can make the other team think about ice cream, while you steal the ball. Or have the hot hands or cold. You can hve super speed, or make the other team have slippery hands. Watch out for getting called for a foul though. There are two pro players in this game. Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Lisa Leslie of the Los Angeles Sparks. Kevin Garnett can dunk and shoot close-in shots. He usually doesn't make three-pointers. Lisa Leslie can sometime make them. She can't dunk very easily though. If you want to make yourself, do that. Choose how good you are at inside shooting, outside shooting, ball-handling, defense, and quickness. This game takes a 166MHz, I reccomend having a 200MHz or higher. If not it will go a little bit slower. But,BUY THIS GAME!!!! IT is WORTH IT!!"

So I am not taking any chances.Addendum: October 2007Just recently found out that there is a product called ClamShell AV for Mac which is a freeware.Good to hear that people have been giving up Norton for better and slimmer virus scanners like AVG on Windows and ClamShell AV on Mac.Atleast they managed to rip us for such a long time.That should be a great acheivement.Now give way for better and cheaper products.
35973,0,"Reading the reviews of people who bought this guide for traveling in Europe, it makes me wonder just what the heck they were thinking. So many who posted bad reviews seemed to think that this guide was created to not only tell them about a place of interest, restaurant or hotel...but also navigate them to the place? Not so! This is just a basic travel guide. Nothing more, nothing less. If you want your Garmin GPS device to actually navigate you to a desired place in Europe, you'd better have a Garmin that already has the European maps installed! Perhaps if people would bother to actually READ the full description first, it would save them a LOT of hassles and misunderstandings. This guide is okay, for what it is. It would be nice if there was a way to periodically update the information though."

In March 2007 I updated to 2007 and love it. It does the job great and I am very well pleased with its performance. Trend Micro had problems for a few months upon release of this product but now it does the job very well. Great interface,fast scanning and a great product now that all the bugs are gone. Highly Recommended and by the way I forgot one the most important details. FREE Customer Support by calling their 800 number and talking to a REAL HUMAN and its free because you bought their product.

78147,0,"I purchased the Studio MX 2004 upgrade with the standard version of Flash. Stupid mistake... Now I find out that if I want to upgrade to Flash Professional I have to spend almost as much as the entire Studio MX upgrade price again. That seems a little ridiculous. Make sure that you go ahead and get the Studio MX version with Flash Professional - man I wish I did :(As for the upgrades, Flash has many great improvements and worth the money. I'm not impressed with Dreamweaver. It is nice that they've finally included user authentication for PHP but it just seems like the program isn't as intuitive to work with as it once was. The page tabs on top of the screen instead of the bottom are a pain. Fireworks has a few nice features such as: motion blur, radial blur, and add noise. The autoshapes kind of give it a cheesy feel - something microsoft would make. I hope some day they'll add filters like: spherize, lighting effects, and so on like Photoshop. Of course, you can just go ahead and buy Photoshop to get the features you really want but Fireworks is such a great tool for web designers. (Much easier to learn.)I'm just disgusted with myself for being so stupid to not upgrade to the Flash professional version. Macromedia was counting on dummies like me ;)"
16956,0,"I have had mixed feelings about the Norton Utilities for years. On one hand it gives you some improved tools, over those provided with windows (disk defragmentation, scan disk, registry editor, etc.). On the other hand, my experience has been that the utilities are sometimes the source of the problem rather than the fix and there is deffinitely some damage done from &quot;overengineering&quot; your PC with the tools. I wouldn't recommend them for inexperienced users - Norton has made them really easy to use but they can really do some damage if you click the wrong button. More experienced users usually use a single utility out of the package anyway (I only use it for the registry editor)."

94996,0,"It works pretty well, but (as other reviewers have stated) VPC is an absolute BEAST on your systems resources. You have to keep in mind that you're (basically) running two operating systems at the same time; and, unfortunately, both Win XP and OS/X are rather demanding on your system's RAM and processor speed.Again, VPC works well and I'd have no problem recommending it, but MAKE SURE you have at least a Gig of RAM and a G5 processor. Anything less and (although it may still work) you'll be so displeased with the performance that you'll want to put your head through a wall."

87187,1,"I won't even talk about the other iLife apps. Good though they are, the real story of iLife '04 is Garage Band. It is a powerful, easy-to-use non-linear audio editor. Now, it won't be all things to all people. It is primarily designed as a loop-based music creation system. However, you can add non-software instruments (including vocals) as well, filtering them through various effects, including several adjustable guitar amp modelers. The results--for the price--are absolutely astounding.This program is to music creation what PageMaker was to desktop publishing, lo those many years ago. Unfortunately, that means that everyone with a Mac will now become a 'composer,' but that sort of power-to-the-people freedom is great, in my opinion.Important note: if you buy it, make sure you immediately install the Garage Band update (version 1.0.1?), which is available at the Apple site. It clears up several issues in the initial release.One other important note: This program is a total resource hog! You need a fast G4 or G5 processor and at least 512MB of RAM. It also helps if you have a faster hard drive.(By the way, to the other reviewer who couldn't rename tracks: sure you can. Simply click on the instrument in question, click the &quot;I&quot; button and choose &quot;save instrument.&quot; This allows you to rename the track. You can even rename regions within a track. Click on the region and rename it in the name window in the lower left-hand corner of the main window.)"

It is easy to get canned reports and even easier to build custom reports. Try doing these in QuickBooks, NOT.The menues are laid out in a way that you find what you want to do with little or no searching even as a beginner.The technical support is the best. I can say this with experience as one that has tried to use QuickBooks support also.I heartily recommend over QuickBooks."

59838,1,"MS Access...well, I have been using Access since 2.0, so I know a LOT of the ins and outs.I do NOT believe that Microsoft is banishing this in favor of SQL Server. First of all, SQL is not a front-end engine. It is a server/back-end one. Anyone who'd programmed SQL for more than 5 minutes would know that. I did and have and SQL, though terrific, is prohibitively costly and not for the local bookstore to develop with.One user touts Macros. Do NOT NOT NOT use Macros. They are old school. I have not written a macro since version 2 (there was no choice back then). VBA is the way to go.Many of the ""wizards"" do a halfway decent job building forms, reports, queries, etc. I actually turn OFF the wizards, but it is a matter of choice (for example, I can write a Command Button VBA code faster than I can wait for the wizard for simple things like Adding Records, Opening Reports, etc.) And I can customize it. I also am not a fan on some of the wizard's variable choices. stDocName drives me crazy.Access DOES require some effort to learn and master. I do not consider myself a ""master"" but I am a developer. My employers like to know something about Access and I can tell them some suggestions. Access is great for:- Small client-server companies- Companies that require some degree of customization- The flexibility of adding, configuring and maintaining databases.- An App people are familiar with. (Personally I tried FileMaker Pro and hated it, it was very cludgy and could not be customized like Access).You have to WANT to do some work in Access. Those that want a program that will read your mind and create a database with no effort, you ought to look elsewhere. However, if you can live with a small-to-steep learning curve (depends on how much you WANT to get into Access, I chose the steep path and I am still with it). Access is like Word or Excel. You can do some real rough stuff, but you can also fine tune it and get it running like a charm. I have never heard people complain about Excel having ""formulas that were too difficult to master"". Access is like that too, but you have to have some idea what a relational database IS and how it works. You are not creating spreadsheets here people.Anyway, that is my opinion and it's a decent product and can make you some money if you learn it. DBA's get good wages and usually know their stuff in Access. Or else you can ignore it and try to convince someone to license something else, when they already use Word and Excel.If you want no effort and little customization, try FileMaker Pro. (the last version I used had an awful user interface). If you want to move forwards and write some real stuff that REAL companies use, Access is a whole new world."

82329,1,"This software is easy to load and easy to use. It works well with Microsoft word and its clip art can be used with the T-Shirt Factory. If you can print it on paper, you can print it on a tee shirt! The ""key"" of course is that it allows you to print a mirror image onto the transfer paper and then just iron it on. It would be nice if they are more graphic art available that one could download for a reasonable price. I did find the graphics in the kit a little limited."
56867,1,"After upgrading to Windows Vista I had to replace the old Spyder color calibrator I had. This unit is much smaller than I expected (the colorimeter is about the size of a fat cigarette). Unlike the Spyder, this on (the Pro unit) handles multiple monitors, and that was important to me. The software installed painlessly and it worked like a charm. The calibration procedure had only a few steps and were very clear. The entire procedure taks a few minutes per monitor. Once the first monitor is done, you can review how the uncalibrated color compares to the new profile. It then tells you if you have multiple monitors to drag its window to the next monitor. When you do that it recognizes that you did so and immediately starts the wizard again. Once you are done profiling all your monitors you simply exit. It sets each monitor to the new profile seamlessly. Any time the computer comes out of standby, power save, etc., it automatically resets the calibration on each monitor (you can see the color change a short time). The unit comes with a convenient stand to hold it so that it can be aimed in the same orientation as the monitors and monitors room light conditions to make corrections when the intensity of room light changes. If you have a radical change (like installing new lighting) you should recalibrate, but for minor changes over time (amount of light from windows, extra room lights, etc.) it dos a good job keeping things adjusted.If I drag a window across monitors there is very little difference, which of course is the whole point. I could never do that manually with the monitor color controls and such. I did not buy a calibrator for printers, as the Epson 4000 I use has respectable profiles included. The first prints I made matched the image on the monitor very closely. I would recommend the Huey Pro highly. There is a non-Pro version, but it doesn't handle multiple monitors and has a few other limitations. There is only a price difference of about $20, so I'd suggest going for the Pro."
1627,1,"I upgraded the operating system software my T-Mobile Dash PDA / Cell Phone in order to obtain new features. To my surprise, the upgrade also required a newer version of Microsoft ActiveSync and Microsoft Outlook 2007 in order to successful synchronize my PDA's contact database with my laptop's Outlook contact database. Outlook 2007 installed easily enough and my contacts and calendar items I had been using in Outlook 2002 were transferred to Outlook 2007 without a problem. Outlook 2007 uses a SQL database, so I have had to become accustomed to a longer launch time of Outlook and to be more aware of the size and number of emails that I keep in my In Box and Sent Mail folders due to the synchronization time involved in syncing with the Exchange Email Server."
68713,1,"I have been buying Streets and Trips each year for over 5 years, and use it frequently to plan for business trips (I am on the road 36 weeks per year). I have noticed the product is not as good as it used to be, but it still worthwhile as a planning tool, before leaving. In addition, I prefer printed maps and directions to a GPS in the car. Less distracting.PROS:- I find it invaluable when I have to find directions (on-the-fly), but do not have wi-fi access. You can pull up a map anywhere from your laptop.- The program is very flexible in printing maps and directions. If you don't like the directions or want to shorten them, you can cut them and paste into Word for editing. In addition, you can copy and paste maps as well, so I often print a detailed map of the airport and destination with abbreviated directions inbetween.- Easy to use- Can find stores and other items of interest easily.CONS- The directions from the airport are from the center of the runway rather than the terminal, and often direct you were there are no roads out of the airport. You have to fudge with the program to make it work properly._ It sometimes will not let you click on a highway to select a destination, because it thinks something is not there, when in actuality some new was built there.- the directions often are not the best route. The program does not allow you to easily vary your route. Even if you click on an interstate you wish to use, the directions take you off the interstate then back on it. Another example, I was traveling from Toledo OH to Auburn Hill MI, a straight shot up I-75, however once I got to Detroit, it took me off the interstate on some surface road and then back on for no apparent reason. This actually confused me and resulted in me getting lost. However, that said, I have used NeverLost in Hertz cars many times, and their directions are worse than S&T.;- Few routing options (quickest, shortest, and selected roads only). For example, there is no option to avoid heavily congested roads. They provide constuction information, but not rerouting for construction.- the maps are not as up-to-date as some of the on-line mapping programs (missing new streets).- the GPS is relatively inexpensive and works but is very cumbersome. It is hard to find a place to put the laptop so you can see it without diverting your eyes to much off the road. The sound (at full volume) is not loud enough over road noise, and the one time I used it and had to make a quick stop, the laptop went flying - so I no longer want to risk. The extra money for the GPS sensor was wasted.SUMMARY: No mapping program is perfect. However, this one seems to be getting worse each year. I still like it but really would like to see major improvements. The cost is usually cheap enough to put it with the flaws, so I will probably continue to get one.One side note: it does not work on Apple computers."
72388,1,"It works very well however most of the changes are merely cosmetic. I was using Quickbooks 2004 Basic and was very happy with it.

Intuit is just finding new ways to get your money without much added value."

37307,1,"After using almost every different type of burning and decoding software on the market, taking the long way aroung each time, I ran into Nero. Nero is available as a demo on CNET's (...) for 30 days, and is just enough to change anyone's mind. With the aid of it's onboard decoder, all you have to do is click and drag your mp3 files to a seperate window, and they are automaticaly checked for errors, and converted to WAV format in half the time. Burning time also seems to be faster, regardless of the speed of your burner. You can also use the utility to print lables, titles, and even cd cover sheets. Amazon has a hit on it's hands, for the low price offered. It makes a great gift for anyone into internet music and entertainment. I give it a 5 star raiting because it is a time saver, and is relatively easy to get to know."

92656,1,"It was hard for me when I originally made the transition from WordPerfect to MS Word/Office, but once I did I never looked back.The Students and Teachers edition is an excellent value as it contains 4 full versions of programs that cost more individually than you'd pay for this entire bundle.The catch? First, by installing the software you are agreeing that you are a student or teacher engaged somehow in academia (no, they won't send people to your house to check...it's an honor system kind of thing). The other catch, and the one to really pay attention to, is that you can't upgrade these programs like you could if you purchased the individual program or one of the other Office bundles. This means that if a Word 2004 upgrade becomes available one day you could not install it to upgrade the version of Word that comes with this bundle. You'd either have to buy the next edition of the Students and Teachers bundle or purchase another full version of Word (either in one of the other bundles that Microsoft Offers at substantially more than the S&amp;T edition or as the stand alone program which still costs more that the S&amp;T edition).Small price to pay, however, as the money you save in obtaining the Students and Teachers edition will still allow you to buy upcoming versions for generations to come and you'd still come out ahead as this bundle is such a great deal."
13922,1,"This program does a great job of teaching typing. My 8th grade daughter has voluntarily worked with it daily for the past two weeks. She has gone from 35 wpm to 50 wpm (adjusted) in that two weeks. My 11th grade son uses it, too, but his typing skills are weak and only slowly improving (from 10 to 12 wpm). My complaint is about the manuscript training; we cannot figure out where the manuscript is that the students are to be copying from. If the program showed where to find them to print them out for the lesson, this would get 5 stars."
73380,0,"The Rosetta stone program is an immersion style learning package that, while thorough and technically adequate, fails to deliver enough value to justify it's lofty price tag.My recommendation to anyone interested in this software is to go to the Rosetta Stone website and sign up for a month of access to the online version. You will have access to the entire package contents and can make a determination as to whether it is something worth making such a large investment in. Personally I found it immediately boring and not much better than a glorified flash card program.

83662,1,"PROS --- 1. Hidden Evil has a great story line, bringing hints from the television episodes to culmination in the mysterious &quot;Briar Patch&quot; from the recent Star Trek movie. I wish the game had contained even more of these interwoven story elements.2. The graphics were very easy on the eyes, though not as remarkable as those in Presto's previous game: &quot;Journeyman Project: Legacy of Time.&quot; The cut-scenes in Hidden Evil were extremely well done. It's obvious that great care was taken to maintain the authenticity of the Star Trek Universe: Trek detail was as good as it gets.3. I felt I had plenty of interaction with Picard, although Data dropped out of the game pretty quickly. The character of Ensign Sovok was well developed and engaging. The game did a very professional job of making me feel that, through believable twists of fate, the future of the galaxy rested on my shoulders. I found myself wondering how my favorite Trek characters, when facing similar challenges, always manage to stay alive and make the right split-second decision every time. I felt drawn into the Star Trek world to a degree I have never experienced before.CONS --- 1. This was my first true action game. Although I primarily enjoy Myst-style games, I had always wondered if I was missing out on something by not playing action adventures. I managed to get about halfway through this game before I admitted defeat and used a cheat code that gave me invulnerability. I thought that this code would eliminate the combat, but instead my character just kept getting shot over and over, while grunting and spewing bits of impact debris all over the place. And I still needed to shoot other characters in order to progress. Although using the cheat code helped me get through the game, I found that it did not increase my enjoyment. I guess I just don't like killing things, not even virtual things (not even Evil virtual things).2. I thought that the keyboard interface was by far the most difficult aspect of the game. Although I've used the keyboard in other, more traditional adventure games, no other game I've tried demanded anything even close to the coordination and speed necessary here. Sometimes you are running, firing a weapon, and trying to access inventory all at the same time -- you really need three hands. And it's a good thing I couldn't fall off cliffs into the abyss -- I would have spent so much time restoring my game that I probably would have quit outright. Maybe the designers should have come up with a crawl mode for people like me. By the time I reached the &quot;stealth&quot; level late in the game, I still wasn't good enough with the keyboard to be able to complete the level. If I hadn't finally resorted to using one of my son's saved games, I probably would have been stuck there forever.BOTTOM LINE --- Hidden Evil is more oriented to the action gamer than to the traditional adventure gamer. If you are not experienced in using the keyboard as an input device, expect to face a stiff learning curve. However, if you are a Trek fan, and enjoy arcade/action challenges, this game is well worth your time and money."
13239,1,"I couldn't disagree more with the reviews bashing this software. I've worked with numerous accounting software packages and this is my favorite.

Peachtree is a stable, complete and well respected software package.With any software there is a learning curve. Quickbooks, because of it's wide following, tries to be everything to everybody. It is overly complex, and not easy to learn. Peachtree focuses on small business, virtually exclusively. It doesn't make accounting overly complex like Quickbooks. The reality is, you must have SOME accounting knowledge to use either product effectively. While Quickbooks might ""seem"" easier to the untrained, the reality is, if you're untrained, the end product will be garbage. Just because it's easy, doesn't mean it's right.If you learn this product, not only will you be able to handle your accounting, it will be right. Just because the masses are heading to Quickbooks, doesn't make it better..... Think for yourself. This IS excellent software.Good luck...."
20223,1,"I submitted this review once before, but obviously Amazon didn't like my language used.I was so mad when I received this package in the mail and read the 'requisites' that had to be fulfilled to use the rebate I was HOT! You have to have purchased either MS publisher in a previous version or other MS products to qualify for sending in the $30.00 rebate. I was totally 'ticked off' before I even opened the software package after reading the rebate requirements.If you are looking to purchase a great program, go ahead and buy it, but you might do better buying it in a local store versus having to wait a week or more to receive the MS Publisher in the mail promising a $30.00 rebate that you have to bend over backwards in order to take advantage of.I have used Publisher for over five years and it is one of the easiest, user-friendly packages available for those wishing to put together great newsletters, calendars, and greeting cards. If you want to pay full price and forget the rebate and you aren't able to get to a local store to purchase, then this is a good alternative."
3988,1,"This GPS navigation system is first rate. After some initial set up problems, which are easily corrected after reviewing the Travroute web site, Q &amp; A section. The program is super. We haven't been lost since. Even when you make a wrong turn the program re-routes you to your destination."
77347,1,I have been using Dragon NaturallySpeaking products for 11 years now. I recently bought Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 preferred because I wanted to upgrade from version 8. Rather than buying an upgrade version I bought a brand-new version because I found it here at Amazon for an excellent price. When the product arrived and I put my CD in to load the program that is where my problems began. I tried several times to download the program and got the same error message saying that it could not locate the file. When I visited the manufacturer's website I found absolutely no help. After hours of research I finally discovered I had a bad CD and I needed to download the update from the manufacturer's website. But it was still confusing because it said the update was for windows vista operating system. It was only after I decided to take a chance on the update that I received word from the manufacturer that this update would also work with XP. I could've had this problem solved a lot faster if that information had been included on the manufacturer website. Once I got the update and was able to install Dragon NaturallySpeaking it has worked great! It is so much better than my previous version and it's a lot faster too! Bottom line this is a great program but customer service totally sucks!
79833,1,"After reading the reviews on this page and on TaxCut's page, I almost decided to go back and do the taxes by hand. Fortunately, I didn't do it and instead I bought TT Basic and thought I'll give it a try, before putting it down.From the beginning, I have to say my taxes were pretty straightforward, except for the confusing Schedule D. Turbo Tax worked great, the questions were easy to understand, going back and undoing was very easy and your current calculations were always displayed in the top right corner.Before starting, the program updated 29 files, which temporary freezed my PC (even at 384 MB RAM, running XP). However, the program didn't crash and after updating I was able to continue from where I left. Saving after a number of steps is also very useful, since the program will restart from this point on. I have not met the condition where you have to reconfirm some steps, but it may be because I saved by 'chapters'.The only issue i found was one where the program would refuse to print, saying that it does not have the right fonts. A note on Intuit's site was saying to uninstall and reinstall the program until this is corrected. If that is true, then I can be an IT guy at any time ... Since it sounded really silly, I chose not to do it and instead I saved these files as pdfs, then printed them with no problems. Actually - one other issue here - the pennies are not displayed on those forms you print and I was not able to find a way to setup the page better, so that the full numbers enter on page.One other interesting thing - the program runs without needing the CD in the CD driver. May be a good thing, if it would allow to instal it on multiple PCs, but I have not tried to do it.Other bad things - some software you don't want will be installed on your PC and you have no control over it. Fine prints also show their ugly face from time to time (like for example, if you choose to have your e-file fee deducted directly from your refund, you have to pay $12 - but there is also another path, where you can pay by credit card, without additional fees).Overall, I was satisfied with this program. I did not have to use their Tech Support and besides Schedule D, I didn't have anything complicated. If this is your case, then, well, it looks like it's working, so go for it!One final note: Do the State taxes by hand! Takes 5 minutes and it's certainly not worth paying $30 and waiting 8 weeks to get them back."
8949,1,"I work with a small business with very limited funds for computer equipment and software. When I found this product I was excited, and then when I used it I was blown away! Whatever I want to accomplish with PDF, Nitro can do. And, it's faster! At one-third the cost of the standard PDF program, I must say I am very happy with my purchase."
71077,1,"Very interesting & slightly challenging games to aid learning; nice graphics & storyline. Kids love it--have 2 preschool, 1 K, 2 2nd and 1 3rd grade--all wait (and watch others progression) impatiently to play it. Had initial problems with installing & some sound or stopping (on Vista) but got immediate response that fixed all from Disney on line."
6775,1,"This is not a program for those who want a grammar based way to learn a language. Actually I don't have version 8 but I have version 7. I think their concept is the same, though-learn language through conversation practice, not grammar exercises. If you have had some Spanish and want to improve your speaking abilities, this is a good program for you, but if you have never had Spanish and would like to understand grammar concepts, this program will not provide a chapter based grammar, learning program."
68584,0,"It works alright, but not great with my Sony Handycam. I ended up having to upgrade my RAM and Harddrive to keep it from stuttering. The pinnacle software is a little to simplistic for me. I would like to do a llittle more with captured video. Pinnacle seems a little limited here."
21470,2,I bought both the German and Spanish Pro software packages. I opened the German first and found it very confusing and poorly laid out. There is no clear lesson plan and there are no steps provided for LEARNING the language. They might as well just drop you in the middle of Munich and expect you to start learning German that way. Needless to say I didn't open the Spanish Pro software and returned it... Unless you already speak German and want to brush up (even then pick something else) you might want to think twice...
72286,2,"Nothing but problems. Multiple errors trying to run software. Looks in wrong drive's for CD amoungst other issues (errors which are recognized on their website...but not easily resolved without changes at the PC end). Cannot download ""updated"" fashions (site coming soon....yeah right?). Could not Register...would never even connect to given site? Nothing but problems. Would not recommend. Store won't take back or refund (open software policy). Your risk."
33064,1,WE LOVE THIS GAME. GET PUTT PUTT OR GO TO HELLOWEEN.
33226,1,"One of the best Apple OS's ever. Worth every penny.Better speed and quicker startups (for both G4 and G3). Very smooth feel, solid operation. Mail app (with new filters) and Address Book are indispensable, reliable tools. Axis print server with Epson 740 works exceptionally well with 10.2. Apple has delivered with Windows networking - easy to use and reliable. (Of course, Mac networking is a snap to set up.)Helper apps are very handy. Sherlock is much improved. And a quick Find has been added to the OS. Plus, a Midi tool has been provided.And alas, Spring Loaded Folders are back!!I haven't even touched on the ever useful Developer Tools (included in the box).This upgrade has something for every level of computer user. And it works out of the box ... no fuss, no headaches."
67673,1,"I have over a dozen website at MSN communities, 1 at Angelfire and 1 at Bravenet, and they have improved 1000% since getting this program. I now make my own splash pages, edit, creating everything and anything.Simple to use, and with an easy step by step manual for both paint shop and animation shop, you will be doing animations, backgrounds, web sets in more in no time at all.There is PSP addictions rampant in MSN communities - everyone loves this program - and the creativity is wonderful to be a part of. There are many teaching sites there that help you work with PSP. I have recommended many people to try the free 30 day download of this item and everyone that has tried it buys it.When you buy it, get it here, they often have promotions that bring the price down ridiculously low.WORTH EVERY PENNY!!"
9296,0,"Overall, it's a decent product. However, the phone support disconnected me 3 times and my emails have gone unanswered for 2 months! I upgraded from a previous version - which I installed 6 months ago. I THOUGHT the upgrade would extend my previous subscription to get upgrades and virus definitions. Instead, it gave me one year from the date of the upgrade. So I lost 6 months of subscription time!While AntiVirus appears to work, my computer (WinXP, P4 2.6GHz, 512MB Ram) has slowed significantly since upgrading. And that's AFTER I ran speed disk, web doctor, etc. And no, I have not installed anything else. I'm considering uninstalling and reinstalling, although from other reviews that seems like a risk in itself."
48651,2,"I didn't like this game very much. It was okay at the begining but I couldn't skip the dialogues at all when I accidentally clicked on the same thing twice. That wasn't too bad, but all you can do in this is look for props and cast members to be in your episode. There's only one episode so it's sort of repetitious and there are no points or rewards for having the right characters in the episode (or so that I know of). Yeah, it's fun at first but I haven't finished it and probably won't since there's nothing new."
69714,0,"Owning every game in the Nancy Drew PC series, it's evident how much the games have changed over time, and whether it's improved graphics or more detailed character design, it's usually for the better. I still love to play the games from the classic part of the series (games one through nine), and although this one definitely isn't the best of the first few games, there are still a few positive aspects in this one, you just have to look hard to find some of them.Story: 8/10. This story is somewhat of a rarity for the Nancy Drew games, because it's pretty much two stories in one mystery: Ghoulish ghost dogs appear in the middle of the night and try to maul Sally McDonald's house (the house Nancy stays at in the game). There is also the theory that a man named Mickey Malone buried treasure somewhere on Sally's property, which used to be his land. I loved the idea of two stories, and these two melded together pretty well, and were pretty well done.Graphics/Setting: 7/10. Since this game was released in late 2002, the graphics aren't going to be that amazing, but the setting was somewhat decent, as you got to explore a convenience store, a forest, a graveyard, a sheriff station and the actual house Nancy stays at.Characters: 6.5/10. This game has one or two less suspects than usual Nancy Drew games (this one has 3 people that you meet in person), and they somewhat feel bland. You have Emily, the southern store owner, Red, the anthropic bird watcher, and Ranger Akers, the strict runner of the town who loves ticketing people. None of them are very colorful, and definitely aren't the highlight of this game.Puzzles/Exploring: 5.5/10. They're aren't many puzzles in here as there are tasks, and one thing that forces me to knock down this game's score is that exploration feels practically nonexistent. They're really isn't anything to search or sleuth in besides a frustratingly big forest and the occaisonal passage. But the few puzzles that were there I could usually do without hints, which means that they were really simple.Activities:5/10. Another thing that is pretty much nonexistent in this game. The only things that even come close to fun activities in this game are bird-watching and reading the lake's history on the Sheriff's computer. I would have like more plain fun to be added in this game.Ending:7.5/10. Some endings take a little bit of time to complete, and may even require a second chance, but this one is over very quickly, yet it somehow gives you that goosebumpy feeling that good Nancy Drew endings give you. I'm sure you know what I meanTotal (average): 6.58 out of 10, averaged to....6.5/10.While there can still be some fun to be had with this game if you're a diehard fan like me, I'd recommend that new Nancy Drew PC fans or someone looking for one of the games to buy, look at another HERInteractive title for now."
39361,1,"Where to start to talk about how amazing the latest offering is from Apple for the Macintosh? Let's take it one step at a time.iMovie 3: Apple took their already great DV editing program and added so many new features it's almost mind boggling! Drag and drop from your iPhoto photo library. Drag and drop from your iTunes music library. Granted, you were able to do these things before in a somewhat clumsy way through the &quot;import&quot; command, but this makes it beyond easy. Chapter support (The ability to break up longer videos on DVD's to easily skip back and forth) for iDVD. Individual volume control for each audio track at any point in the track. One click access for all three of the other iApps. New titles, new transitions, the &quot;Ken Burns&quot; effect with stills. No other DV software available for ANY platform is as easy to use as this. Also if you download from Apple it's FREE!iPhoto: Still mostly looks the same, but there is now support for the other digital lifestyle iApps built in. The &quot;Retouch&quot; editing feature works amazing well. Also if you download it from Apple it's FREE! If your into serious photo editing, you'll still want a companion program. Photoshop Elements is a good choice. 70% of Photoshop at 1/5 of the price.iTunes: I honestly don't see much difference here. I'm sure changes were made to integrate it with the other iApps. Still a great program though. If you download it from Apple (deja vu) it's FREE!iDVD: Some new themes, some new features make this a worthy addition to any SuperDrive equipped Mac. No other DVD authoring software I've seen is as easy to use and as intuitive as iDVD. AND if you download it from Apple it's....um....not available. iDVD can only be purchased as part of the iLife package AND then only installed if you have a Superdrive equipped (internal drive only and as far as I know ONLY if installed by Apple) G4 PowerMac.Complaints: Yeah a few. iMovie crashed a few times while performing multiple operations (granted it was doing 4 &quot;Ken Burns&quot; and 5 transitions at the time) on my 933 SuperDrive G4 Quicksilver Tower. Also the Apple restricts iDVD to only those people who bought their SuperDrive equipped G4 computers. C'mon Apple! We bought the hardware. Let us configure it ourselves without penalties! Also, you must be running at least 10.1.5 or later (10.2 HIGHLY recommended). System 9 users are officially out in the cold for this product.In conclusion: If you meet the hardware/software specs, this is a must buy! No SuperDrive? Find a fast online connection and download the other pieces."
4581,1,"I just received this item in the mail recently and already I'm impressed. However, I would like to offer a couple of warnings to beginner Arabic learners:1. First, do NOT buy this AND the ""LINGUAPHONE Arabic InAction V2"" CD-ROM because they are the same product. The only difference between the two is that ""Learn Arabic Now"" has two additional catagories/lessons a few more games, and 5,000 additional Arabic words that can be learned. ""Linguaphone V2"" seems to be the condensed/abridged version of ""Learn Arabic Now"" because the graphics and program set-up are identical.2. Purchase Nicholas Awde's ""THE ARABIC ALPHABET: How to Read & Write It"" and study it before engaging in this program. Though good, ""Learn Arabic Now"" does not give lessons on Arabic script and stroke order. The alphabet is briefly explained in a pop-up, but this is a general overview that only someone who has studied the Arabic alphabet would be able to relate to.3. Also, don't be intimidated by the program. It is constructed to give an ""instant immersion"" effect. This is good, but I find it most effective to spend one week on 1 or 2 sentences of new Arabic vocabulary before moving on to new lessons.4. Finally, if I were not already listening to Pimsleur's ""Instant Conversion"" CDs (the one on the Barnes & Noble site has 10 CDs, unlike Amazon's version which just has 8), I would be totally overwhelmed by ""Learn Arabic Now"". However, since ""Instant Conversation"" has already prepped me, almost everything in ""Learn Arabic Now"" is a reinforcement of previously learned vocubalary."
57958,1,"From mysterious halls to darkened legends, Nancy Drew, The Curse of Blackmoor Manor is filled with tons of spookiness, fun, and ultimately a mystery that no adventure gamer should ever miss in their lifetime. Continue reading and find out why!(Note: I'm not going to specify any specifics because I haven't played this game in a while and I don't want to spoil it for other players who haven't played the game yet.)The Story: 5 out of 5If there's one thing that really made The Curse of Blackmoor Manor shine, it was the storyline. Who wouldn't want to get invited to an old victorian mansion of the 14th century? Most especially with a ""beastifying"" curse that holds it bound to spookiness!Basically in this game, Nancy is invited to the manor to find out why one of her friends, Linda, has suddenly inexplicably fallen ill, rendering her bedridden until she can get better. Locked away in her bedroom behind a series of bed curtains, Nancy can only see her hairy and eerie hands, and slowly she realizes that there are ""doors that should never be opened..."".The cast of characters in CUR are quite intricate, if not amazingly well interwoven into the overall story. There's Linda, which is the bedridden victim to the manor's curse, Mrs. Drake, the Great Aunt who has a fanaticism for planting, the typical rebel teenager Jane and her strict and mysterious tutor Ethel, and lastly there's the awkward, yet indignant scholar Nigel who roams the Penvellyn library. Oh and don't forget Lulu, the mysterious caged bird that loves to speak her mind and offer a variety of hints.Overall, I think what made the cast so special was the fact that each of the characters played an immense role in solving the mystery of the game. The intense drama between Linda and Jane really added a layer of depth into the game, and it was especially interesting to be in the middle of the Penvellyn's family problems. Nigel and Ethel also proved to be very suspicious, most especially Ethel. (If you know what I mean...) I won't spoil too much, but for those of you that haven't played the game, keep a close eye on Ethel, you're in for a surprise! Mrs. Drake was also a very interesting character to interact with, especially when it came to learning more about the manor's history. Lastly, Lulu was also very humorous and she added a layer of comedy to a mansion so dreary.Gameplay: 5 out of 5Roaming the walls of the Penvellyn Manor was very intriguing. Each and every room had something eerie or odd, and there was NEVER any moments where there wasn't ""enough"" to snoop. From the many halls and rooms, to the grand foyer and passages, it almost felt like there was never an end to the new discoveries!The puzzles in the game were also very clever and quite difficult, even on the Junior Detective difficulty. I often found myself stuck on one puzzle for days, trying to figure out how to solve it. I'd think about it, even draw it out! There's no doubt, this Nancy Drew game will have you scrounging for a pad of paper and a pen/pencil almost instantly.One of the things that I also liked about the game was that, bit by bit, the Manor would slowly open it's pages to you. In the beginning of the game, the Manor is this dark and dreary place filled with unsolved puzzles, broken fountains, and pillars whose pieces must be found. As Nancy discovers all the secrets behind all these puzzles, the Manor slowly transformed into this world of intrigue and wonder. Puzzles that seemed forgotten and broken could now be solved (the fountain), rooms that were thought to be completely destroyed are completely accessible with enough mental power. Secrets that were thought to be hidden forever can be explored and discovered!Another thing that made the game really fun was the spook factor. I don't think there was ever a time when I didn't feel scared in this game. From the ghosts and nightmares, to the secret passageways and rituals, this game will have your adrenaline running and your hands cold with fear.What's a mystery without some comic relief? Throughout the game, Nancy would also be able to order food from the local pub and get it sent to her room, play cards with an incredibly disturbing dummy, and bake food for the starving Lulu.Overall, the gameplay in Curse of Blackmoor Manor was truly amazing. It always thought provoking, eerie, and most importantly fun!Music Soundtrack: 5 out of 5If there's another thing that rocks in this game, it would most definitely be the soundtrack. From the violin themes of ""Memoirs"", to the wizardy theme of ""Fairy"", each of the game's songs offered a very unique tone to it. To this day, I still listen to the songs that were composed in this game. I highly commend the soundtrack artist for their hard work into making this game so real, sound effects and soundtrack!Ending: 4 out of 5If there's one thing that really could go wrong with this game, it would probably be the ending. (Note: This is spoiler free, and I will try not to interject any spoilers as much as I can!)Throughout the whole game, there was this constant tension that was really building, almost bubbling over to the point of insanity. The great plot of the game really went downhill at the end.It wasn't bad by any means, it was just disappointing. It was almost as if the writers of the game had a great idea, but then didn't really put it all together in the end. Almost as if they just slapped together a ""decent"" ending to cover all the loose holes. (No pun intended.)Overall, the ending was good, but it most definitely could have been SO much better! I was really hoping for something that involved the referenced ""monster"", but the loose ends regarding the curse were never really fulfilled, and it left the player feeling a little lost and disappointed. Like I mentioned, it wasn't bad, but could have been much, much better.Conclusion:5 out of 5Overall, Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor is a game not to miss. The characters are all wonderful, the puzzles are cleverly designed and ingenious, and the plot line will keep you guessing until the very last few minutes. Although the ending wasn't the best in my book, I would still say that this is probably one of the best Nancy Drew games ever developed. I highly, HIGHLY, recommend that you play this game if you haven't played it yet. What are you waiting for? Dare to play!"
75476,1,"Roller Coaster Tycoon was a great game, but the only problem with it is it does't let you be free, and build whatever you want. Neither does the expansion pack, but it is a lot better then the orginal, besides the fact that it takes away a great ride, the Superman thing (The roller coaster that shoots you strait up). However, it does add some awesome roller coasters, like the steel twister (which is like The Hulk or Kumba), which lets you do a lot more. Overall, I would give this game 4 stars because it still doesn't let you build freely, but it is a good add on pack."
44310,1,This was a fast easy purchase and I love the program. I highly recommend this seller!
25944,0,"More effort could have been put into the description of the installation process. Specifically, the manual or the online description could have explained whether the new software would delete the previous version automatically or not. It only says to delete your old virus software, thus leaving the user in a bit of anxiety, especially if you've run into the same problem with Norton's Internet Security software, where confusing instructions can mislead the user into deleting the previous software, which unbeknownst to the user kills months of user settings. User settings are not so important with this software, it seems, but on the other hand I've had a problem with older versions of Norton products where they didn't mesh correctly (sometimes a component would appear ungrouped from the other components on the system tray, and sometimes it would be grouped, without any action on my part), so I was worried that there might be a preferred order of installation between SystemWorks and other Norton products. There was almost nothing that I could find in the manual to explain the issue, at least that I could tell from the index references. Maybe it was there, but I think issues like that should be spelled out during installation -- they are issues that could have been uncovered with better beta testing, I think.On a bright note, the price for this item on Amazon is really great ... I bought at Staples for [money] more, and came upon this item here by accident, and now I'm regretting having bought elsewhere. Always check Amazon before buying!"
52809,1,"The Rosetta Stone series of computer-assisted language learning programs are the most fun way to learn a language I know!Several years ago I purchased the Italian series and found being able to listen to native speakers helped me improve my Italian accent immensely.Rosetta Stone starts you off in the same way children learn a language: you see images and hear their names and right away start learning the language! You don't start by memorizing grammar rules and such, but by being exposed to the language. Repetition within the lessons ensure you learn the important points almost effortlessly. And you work at your own pace! If you have a microphone, you can see how you match up with native speakers of the language, which is a tremendous help.The Explorer series is an inexpensive way to try out the series. For very little money, you receive the first lesson in Swedish, but even better, the CD contains samplers of all of the Rosetta Stone language lessons! Want to hear how to say &quot;girl&quot; in Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and German? It's here!I think a Rosetta Stone Explorer would be a wonderful gift for anyone who is interested in languages.The software installs on both Windows and the Macintosh. I find that it works flawlessly on my Mac laptop."
17302,0,"Tried trail ver of product and was dissapointed. For [an expensive] Windows based program it was lacking. Navigation through it's modules was confusing, I was interested in it for a construction business but the ID numbering system (8 char),and component description (20 char) were very limiting. There was a ""component type"" that could be used for listing Phases, Master, or Subcomponents but you can not assign a subcomponent to a Master or Phase. There is also a cost type where you can assign labor, material, etc. Mutiuser capability is very good in that you can limit access to certain areas to users. For the money Peachtree Complete Account is better buy at [less money]. It has a 20 char. ID limit and 30 char description limit and is very easy to navigate and understand."
23254,0,"This software is very difficult to learn-as-you-go. I am a former Quicken user and while that was easy to fumble through while learning without too much fear of making a far reaching mistake, Quick Books is laden with important-seeming details and hard-to-master steps and pre-labeled categories that don't seem to be applicable to my business. This software may be very helpful for a business that buys widgets from the widget wholesaler using an invoice and then sells the widgets to a customer using a bill of sale. It doesn't do much for someone who sells his services on commission without using invoices or bills. Self-employed professionals need not buy this software. Even the check register is harder to use and almost impossible to customize than Quicken was. I do not recommend this software at all."
34579,1,"Basically, you raise and care for virtual pet dogs or cats. Both of my daughters, ages 3.5 and 9, love this game. The 9 year old understands it better and is able to play it the way it is intended to be played, but the 3.5 year old still likes to get on the computer and play with the cute little dogs. It is a simplistic game, but the animals are cute. Nothing challenging here- you feed, exercise, and groom your virtual dogs/cats on a daily basis. If you don't regularly care for them, they run away. They can fall in love and have puppies/kittens. Again, nothing challenging, but both of my daughters enjoy this game a lot."
39229,1,"I found this one at a store and I love puzzles, so I bought it. It's fantastic. I love a challenge, so I picked the hardest level of play. Even after solving the mystery, I have assembled the castle at least 6 times. Of all of the Puzz 3-D puzzles, this is my most favorite. Hope they come out with many more Puzz 3-D's. I currently own all four to date."
22360,1,"This works as advertised. I had tried the product that came with Easy CD creator and was really disappointed. All of the scratches and clicks were easily removed from old vinyl recordings with Audio Cleaning Lab without losing any noticeable quality from the recording. Numerous features as described for enhancing the quality of the recording. I would recommend the full version (carried by Amazon) rather than the e version, downloadable at Magix web site, since the e version doesn't include their ""wizards"" and some other useful features that the boxed version contains. Great product!!!"
30129,1,"I have been a long time user of Norton products. Though I don't recommend their system mechanic software, their Antivirus and Firewall software has usually been consistently good. However with the 2005 and with the 2006 versions there was a noticeable drag on system performance. And the price for renewing a subscription or purchasing for two household computers was too pricey for my tastes. So I tried Zone Alarm 6 and then renewed with Zone Alarm 7 which I have also reviewed on Amazon. There were problems with Zone Alarm 7 which I was unable to resolve even searching their forums. So I checked out Norton. For a very reasonable price I could purchase a three computer license and downloaded the sofware from Norton's site. It was very easy to install. Unlike previous versions of Norton, the Live Update worked reliably and quite well. I have been quite pleased with the minimal impact on system performance which is close to or exceeds Zone Alarm 6 and certainly 7. Namely, there is a faster bootup time and less drag as I am working on my computer including intensive tasks such as music production or photography. The antivirus and antispyware scanning did take much longer than Zone Alarm but this can always be scheduled as an overnight task. The interface of Norton has changed a little bit and is somewhat more user friendly. Norton also addedd an antifraud toolbar to my Internet Explorer 7 presumably to fish out phishing. Other than the long scanning time, the only other downside I noticed is that other than purchasing a DVD or the extended download plan there wasn't anyway for me to back up the purchased software myself. My overall take on this is that Norton has listened to user complaints regarding system performance impact, reliability of Live Update and several other issues.

56651,1,"I bought this after reading the other reviews here...and they are right on the mark. My daughter is not even 2 1/2 yet and she goes looking for the disc all the time. (She even stuck it into the computer today by herself...have to do something about that!) I sit and do it with her, but she can also now do some of the games herself....coloring, bubble game, flashlight game. And she has only had it a short while. She uses the mouse and then starts hitting the keyboard when she tires of the mouse. Both work. And they don't have to click the mouse...just move it. I'm very happy with the purchase."

80929,1,"I bought this because Symantec was not doing a good job of scanning my two month old laptop. Needless to say, my laptop caught a virus and crash right when I had an important assignment due. I did a lot of research to find one that would fit my needs; network protection, spyware, antivirus, etc. and ended up finding the PC-cillin Internet Security packet to be one of the best.It has been a month now since I have been using this,and although it is somewhat better than Symantec, it definitely is not an application that will protect you against Spyware, or Adware."
87224,1,This is a great product! My only criticism would be that it does not have a hard copy manual. I have used Print Shop for years so the lack of a manual did not effect me but it might a first time user.

20492,1,"I will NOT say that this is the excellent application! But for sure this will beat all other consumer video editing application. I still remember I used to use Ulead's software. After that I got chance to use Pinnacle's software, and I liked it very much! It is slim,slick, elegant software. Looks like this company is totally in video editing. They provide the feature which are like professional video editing. So I checked out Pinnacle web site (www.pinnaclesys.com), I found that they have lots of video editing products from consumer to professional to broadcast! Check out their their Edition, liquid, Blue products which are high end products."

I can't say that I've played a better game than The Day The World Broke. Definitely a thinking-person's game. I'll be looking for the sequel!"
8303,1,"I've used this software since version 1998, almost in all North and South America Countries, and it has been very useful to me. I use it connected to my Magellan GPS and my laptop while driving. Using the Monitor and Record funtionality, I get all NMEA data from the GPS in TXT format from where I can extract all kinds of information I need. This feature is not found in other similar software products."
22701,1,"The name ""Hallmark"" says it all. I've had other greeting card programs (American Greetings) and this by far is better quality. Mabye because I've had other programs, going through this one with the features and address book set up was a breeze. The selection of fonts and clipart is beyond comparison. I really like how easy it is to use and personalize.So much so, from now on I will only buy Hallmark greeting card software. I really like making my own personalized greeting cards, and for sure family and friends like that personalized touch. I will not buy anymore cards from the store, with maybe the exception of Christmas cards, maybe. Who knows, the year 2006 is upon us and it might be a Hallmark Christmas.And as always, Amazon is the best place to shop online. Time and time again I find myself on this great site ordering the best they have to offer with the best deals. Keep up the good work!!!!"
32158,0,"This is a fun program to play around with, and can be used for getting ideas for smaller projects. I wouldn't recommend using this program if you are trying to get real architectural detail however- it is really hard to learn all the functions in the program, especially the topography mapping. The instruction book is really simplified, and there are no other resources that I've found to help with my more technical questions.Bottom line: entertaining, but if you plan on doing fully detailed work, look elsewhere."
1337,1,"I really use this program for anything and everything. It is very versatile. I use it to scan pictures into, for plain storage or to modify. You can of course do all of the regular &quot;photo fixers&quot; you can imagine. Sharpen the focus of the picture, change the brightness, get rid of red-eye, crop it, paint something, cut something out or off, add a border or text, and I could go on and on. You can even make it into a black and white picture or a painting. You can also use your scanned photos for all kinds of things. You can crop out a person and place him/her in another scene or backdrop behind with added objects on top (for them to hold or wear). You can take the face off of a person and put it on another body. The sky's the limit. I also use it for clip-art. It has a huge selection of pictures to use for any and everything. You can also make anything with this program, such as birthday cards, invitations, etc. I also use it when I need to print out text for display on my children's science fair projects or when I have to teach a lesson. Plus, I can add a cute picture or two relevant to the topic. It's great. I really use it often."
64310,0,"I wanted LoJack for my new Sager NP9262 notebook running Vista Ultimate. It wouldn't install. Customer support sent me a customized installation package, which worked okay.After installing LoJack, I began to notice mysterious problems. My Sager would sometimes freeze in the BIOS during boot. After a 3 minute delay, it would then proceed and boot normally. Other times Vista would freeze during startup with a blank screen, and I would eventually have to force a power-off and reboot (which usually worked fine).I had numerous contacts with LoJack's customer support. They did their best to be helpful, but could never determine the cause of my problems. I eventually gave up and returned LoJack. (Amazon accepted the return without any problems, which is why I always try to use them, even when other vendors may have a cheaper price!)When I asked LoJack's customer support how to uninstall LoJack, they sent me a procedure, which I followed. Unfortunately, this seems to merely have disabled it, rather than uninstalled it. Its files (rpcnet.exe, rpcnet.dll, rpcnetp.exe and rpcnetp.dll) are still on my hard drive, and I still occasionally have these mysterious hangups.Aside from these problems, LoJack did work as advertised. While it may work just fine for you, I advise caution with this product, as it may modify your BIOS, and it does not seem to be easily removed. I found lots of information on the web, but too late."

78508,1,"I have used PageMaker for many years to produce booklets, newsletters, magazines, etc. It's easy to learn and easy to use, and once you get comfortable with it, you tend to prefer it over word processors which simply are not flexible enough to produce decent publications. MS Publisher and Front Page, I have found, also are not as flexible as PM7. I have never had a problem with bugs in PM7, or with conflicts, and I've used it on many platforms. If it was less expensive, I would strongly recommend it for even small offices that want to produce flyers, brochures, and ads, but don't have good enough tools to do so."
25292,1,"I've tried Ghost and Vertias. They are good software packages, but just too complex.I wanted something that could simply take an image of my harddrive and store it on another physical device. Both Vertias and Ghost Enterprise edition seemed to make the assumption that I had an external backup server. I don't. And while I'm sure I could have taken extra time to configure Vertias or Ghost to work on my server, I just don't have the time for that.Acronis is exactly what Vertias and Ghost are not. It is straight forward, user friendly, hassle free. It's exactly what I was looking for. I have had ZERO problems backing up and restoring using Acronis. I recommend it highly!"

50866,0,"I've used PM since version 3 over twelve years ago. It has been a reliable product but its features have not kept up with Windows (dynamic disk, etc.) For version 8 they seem to have added one feature (ext3 support) - big Whoop. I've installed and used version 7 on WinXP SP2 and static disk partitions without problems so far.Despite what its product page says, it does NOT support external (USB, Firewire, eSATA (?) drives except from a Windows installation. This exposes its biggest limitation - it does NOT give you an easy way to create a fully functional, standalone bootable CD. You can cobble one together using the DOS mode floppy disk (hey, still have one of those?) and a burning program such as Nero. However, DOS support of external drives is very problematic and is not included.WARNING TO NON-TECHIES: Partitioning a hard drive is inherently risky. It is strongly suggested that you read up on how the boot process works.Of course, BACK UP YOUR CRITICAL DATA FIRST!! DO NOT be too hard on Acronis or even Symantec for not working well with UNDOCUMENTED, PROPRIETARY uses of hidden partitions and boot records by computer vendors *cough*HP*cough*Dell*.Run the partition utility from the boot CD, NOT from within Windows. Files in use on a partition PREVENT the utility from changing the partition. Computer geeks would say, DUH.If you need a modern repartitioning utility, look at Linux based Acronis Disk Director or the free System Rescue CD (now at version 1.0.1)."

32378,2,"I really wanted to like this product. ThinkFree Office Suite was going to be my ticket to a Microsoft-free environment when I switched over to the Macintosh platform a few months ago. It touts nearly complete compatibility with the three main MS Office apps: Word, Excel and PowerPoint. It's close, very close but in some ways woefully far.Okay, if you are starting fresh with no history of documents created in the Microsoft programs, you'll be golden. You'll have full-featured versions of the Big Three that will do nearly everything you could hope for and save hundreds of dollars off the Microsoft price. If that's your situation, go for it. If yours is the more typical scenario of dozens or hundreds of files created in Word, Excel and Powerpoint -- plus the need to share files with others using the mainstream programs, think twice. Think more than twice.The first inkling of trouble came when I needed to edit a Powerpoint presentation that I'd created for a client a couple of months before my switch-over to Mac. In ThinkFree Show. I could add the slides he wanted and import the edited graphics but when it came to the _simple_ task of editing the text, I was faced with a nightmare. When I put the cursor into the text box and began typing, the cursor was in the _wrong_ _place_. When I backspaced to try again, it erased the _wrong_ _characters_. I ended up cutting the text and editing it in another application, then pasting it back in. Worse, when my client went to edit some text himself in Powerpoint, he couldn't even get the cursor into the text box! The file was essentially trashed.I went to the ThinkFree site and after a lot of searching around, found an email address to send my problem to. Weeks later, I have _still_ not heard anything. I called their contact phone number and left a message for technical support. I missed their return call and left a message in the voicemail of the fellow who called. Nothing further and it has been over two weeks now.Today was the last straw. I needed to edit a document and send it out to a client right away. When I brought it up in ThinkFree Write, my letterhead was completely skewed in the header. I went in and tried to edit it and was again faced with the inability to change the text in text boxes. When I tried to move the mis-aligned cells of a table, they moved to random places on the page instead of where I'd released the mouse button. I ended up using Word (thankfully I have a copy of Windows with Office running under Parallels on my Mac).At this point, I deeply regret having shelled out the $50 for ThinkFree Office Suite. It's better than nothing -- but just barely."

So even though it got mixed reviews, and I liked first person shooters better (like the Star Trek Voyager game) I picked it up and installed it. Right from the start I liked it. Voices from the TV shows, Brent Spiner returns as Data to guide you though the first mission so you know how to approach it, as well as intruguing new characters and ships all pull you into the game play.

79307,1,One of the best graphics programs on the market for what it costs. The possibilities are endless.
27130,1,This game was fun but very short. The puzzles were much easier than The Curse of Blackmoor Manor and I completed this game in a couple of days. I did not find this game as challenging as the previous one but I still enjoyed playing it. My favorite challenges were the golf game and the driving parts. It was really neat that you could drive Nancy's roadster around town and during the car chase. I would recommend this game for all ages.

28098,2,"I recently switched Windows to Mac. Since Dreamweaver includes both versions, I thought I could deactivate my Windows machine, and install it on the Mac. After calling their customer service department twice, I was told that this is not possible. Once you activate the product on one platform, you have to buy it again if you want to use it on a different platform.I might be willing to pay for an upgrade if they were offering a Universal Binary, but currently they are not. They might even view Intel Mac's as a different plaform the Power PC Mac's and try to charge me again if they release an Intel version.Because their licensing is such a pain, I would not recommend this product to anyone."
68882,0,"In Jumpstart 4th Grade: Haunted Island, you play as a student who missed a day of school when the substitute teacher was a witch and turned your classmates into monsters. Now it's up to you to find a series of items and return your classmates back to normal.First, let's start with the educational aspect. It does pretty well, the cirriculum is fairly balanced. There are a variety of minigames on the island that teach various subjects such as math, English, history, geography, and music. There are adjustable difficulty levels for each game, which is always a good thing.However, I would say this game is better at reinforcing subjects than it is at teaching them. To me it seems the games just sort of throw the subject matter at you without really explaining all that much. I think this is a great game for kids who have finished fourth grade to play over the summer, or perhaps kids who are halfway through fourth grade and have already been taught the lessons but still need to practice them. Some kids who are just starting fourth grade might be stumped at some of the games. Once the kids do get the hang of it, they'll probably have fun playing the various games.It is slightly scary, as obviously indicated by the title and the CD cover. You'll probably know if your kids will like this game or not. I will say I don't think it ever goes too far- it's spooky, but there's nothing nightmare inducing in there.My only real complaint is the price. Since the game is old and discontinued, you probably won't be able to buy it for under $20. It's a decent educational game, but probably not the best there is, so unless you're willing to pay for it, I'd suggest another game."
81773,1,"I am surprised to read how virulently anti-Intuit many comments in the QuickBooks Pro 2003 customer reviews there are, how low the ratings of the product are, and the lopsided number of negative reviews. The emotional outcry seems to have taken a life of its own. Doug Sleeter, a QuickBooks expert of renown says, ""These reviews certainly do not reflect the general opinion of users. If it did, the product would not be nearly as popular in the market.""I recognize the frustration and anger the reviewers expressed about using QuickBooks and many of their concerns are compelling. I would like to address some of the criticism and clarify several issues that they mention. I have been a full time independent QuickBooks consultant for over ten years and during this period I have worked with and trained hundreds of clients one-on-one.The complaints about QuickBooks generally point toward its design and utility, payroll fees, and the cost and quality of support.BASIC NECCESSITIESComplaint: Several people said that they want a basic business program that deals with the ""real necessities"" of a small business. They described QuickBooks as ""bloatware"" and too complicated.Response: What are real necessities for one type of business could be redundant and too complicated for other types of businesses. The basic tasks and simple layout of registers and forms (invoices, checks) in QuickBooks have remained the same since the early Windows versions. User preferences are customized to turn on or off functions and displays.Historically Intuit has had a philosophy about QuickBooks of ""one size fits all."" It has been remarkably successful because of its versatility and is used in many industries. Now Intuit is bringing out various editions of QuickBooks that is designed for specific businesses, for example the new Contractor Edition is very popular. Many good business software programs are able to exchange data with QuickBooks.PAYROLL FEESComplaint: Reviewers complained that now they have to pay extra for QuickBooks to do payroll and buy an upgrade if their version is QuickBooks 2000 or older.Response: Intuit has offered a payroll tax table service for at least seven years. There has always been a charge for the service. The original service was called TTS (Tax Table Service). The company later came out with Basic Payroll Service, which has since been renamed Do-It-Yourself Payroll Service (DIY Payroll). Users do not have to upgrade their QuickBooks every year to do payroll. Although owners of version QuickBooks 2000 and older are required to pay for a new upgrade if they want to continue using DIY Payroll, the benefit of new features like emailing invoices, report enhancements, 3rd party software integration, remote access, and sales orders makes upgrading to the latest edition of QuickBooks worthwhile.SUPPORTComplaint: There are many comments about the cost and quality of support.Response: Paying for software support is a fact of life in today's economy, the same as expenses are incurred in maintaining a car. The cost of QuickBooks is inexpensive and if you factor a support plan into the purchase price, the savings by reducing your accounting fees and better financial management is still a good deal. QuickBooks has made finding ""how to"" information easier by including links to answers in most of its windows and with a comprehensive support database that can be accessed from within the program. Attending a QuickBooks class and visiting support groups on the internet like at Yahoo! help reduce the financial outlay for support.My experience is that by showing patience and respect to the support specialist at Intuit, and by defining the issue well often brings good results.Intuit can and will make many improvements to QuickBooks. The fact is that the vast majority of users appreciate the many benefits they gain by using QuickBooks because it simplifies complex accounting tasks and it is one of the most user friendly software products ever made."
51714,1,"After toying with several different genealogy data processing programs, I find I use Family Tree Maker exclusively. The beauty of the program is that it is very easy to learn and very easy to use, an aspect which allows you to focus on the material you are processing rather than the program itself. In addition to this, individual entries can be tagged with detailed information, revision is simple, and the program is capable of generating numerous useful reports and print outs with a minimum of effort. I strongly recommend the program.When used in conjunction with a subscription to Family Tree Maker's internet database (there is an extra fee for this), the program can produce startling results. I do feel the subscription is worth the cost--but I also offer a word of caution here: researchers should never assume information obtained in such manner is completely accurate. They should instead regard such information as a starting point for their own direct research and prove each entry through independent research."

72244,1,"I ordered PrintFIX PRO after changing to third party inks for my Epson R1800 printer. The colors were completely thrown off and I needed someway to create custom profiles that match the printer/ink/paper combination I use. A little research led me to this product. IT'S WORTH EVERY CENT I SPENT! It takes about 45 minutes to create a custom profile with a 225 patch target. I use 6 different papers, from super glossy to heavy weight cotton rag art paper. Except for surface texture, and the inherent color of each paper, the same picture printed on each paper looks identical. I never got results like this from the color profiles I installed from the paper manufacturers. If you're serious about consistent color reproduction, this is the way to go."
11732,1,"This game is my childhood. I played this game so much as a kid. It was fun then and it's still damn fun now. I don't care what age you are, you will love this game. Although the above reviewer may disagree, the powerups add to the game immensely, since it's a less serious atmosphere than normal baseball (and is better for it). If you go into the game expecting pure fun rather than a nitty-gritty simulation, you will love it to death."
18843,1,"I purchased my first computer when DOS 2.11 was brand-new. I understood the advantage of being able to do things very quickly with the computer. I also found out that you can lose things, destroy things, have all kinds of problems, and do it very quickly! That did not deter me as I purchased my first computer just before I began my doctoral studies. BibleWorks was not yet in existence, though there were some other products on the market. My first experience with BibleWorks was after I had graduated, and gift/graduation money was provided to buy the new BibleWorks 3.5. Having viewed some of the online videos for BibleWorks 9, I calculated that if the changes claimed in the videos for this new issue of the program were true, then I had better have a look at it. I have not been disappointed. By the way: the price for the current BibleWorks is not much more than what I recall that I paid for 3.5! How did they do that?Opening the smallish, attractive box, you see a Quick-Start Guide and three disks. Wait a minute! The box says that it can take up to 15 gigs of space on your hard drive. Oh, these are DVDs so I guess that's possible. I remember when it all fit on a couple of 3.5"" floppy disks. Of course, it did not come with the stunning array of materials now standard with BW. The program and resources as it now stands, would probably take something like 6 CD's or more than 70+ floppy disks (quoting their literature here). Fortunately, most modern computers have plenty of space on the hard drive, and a DVD drive. And if you're really hurting for space, you can do a minimal installation which would take only about 1 gig or so of space. You would then be able to run some of the other things (like the training videos) straight from the DVDs.In any case, the installation worked flawlessly. You do not have to be a computer tech to install this program. I decided to go with the full install at the beginning, but as it was installing, I realized I probably do not need a Chinese translation of the Bible (or many of the other 40+ modern language translations included in the package) mounted on my hard drive. No worries, if you want to remove modules, you do not have to uninstall and then reinstall the program. Removing a few of the modules in this way, saved a little bit of room on my hard drive, and some frustration.One of the wonderful features of this program are the included videos designed to help you learn how to work with the many facets of BW. I strongly encourage anyone who has never used BibleWorks before to watch these videos. Those who are familiar with earlier versions of the program could also learn a lot from them. The how - to videos total up to some six hours of viewing/training.Do not be surprised if you start up the program and feel a bit intimidated! There is a lot of information that greets you. The videos, however, are very helpful in taking you step-by-step through using the program. The resources available in this program are amazing (more on that below). However, I am even more astonished at the ease by which this information may be accessed. I am pretty certain that some of the information that can be accessed in BW 9 could also have been accessed in the earlier versions. But not this quickly, and not this easily, and not with the amount of information that is now available.When you first open BW 9, three windows greet you. The first one, is the search window, which is very similar to earlier versions, in that you can enter a specific book, chapter and verse, or a specific word to search for in the version that you have designated for the search. The search criteria is entered on the command line, which is at the top of the first left-hand window. Just enter what you want to look for, and the results (in the form of a listing of verses, very similar to a paper concordance) appear in the box below - very quickly! In the small amount of time I have had so far with this program in doing searches, I have compared with a paper concordance. All the searches have been very accurate. Versions that you have chosen for display in the middle window (called the browse window) will show the full verses for which you have asked. You can change the version of the Bible that you want to search in a number of different ways. Searches can be designed with control characters (called operators), and you don't even have to know which control characters perform which function, because you can bring up some buttons below the command line (where search parameters are entered) which will tell you the control characters for ""and,"" ""or,"" phrase searches, etc. by means of a mouseover. However, if you do know the operators, you can still simply enter them. The program keeps track of your searches, so you can return to them, but you can also have multiple searches recorded since there are (at least 12) tabs available. So you can do one search, switch to another tab do a different search and then switch back to your first tab. In that way you can compare results.The opening splash screen for the program says that it focuses on the text. This is exactly what the program does. I would contrast this with Logos Software, which includes many, many books in electronic form (yes, Logos does many of the things that BibleWorks does with the biblical text). A gigantic library on your hard drive and abilities to search it with just a few mouse clicks (Logos) is a great advantage. The texts and capabilities included in BibleWorks, however, focus on the text of Scripture itself. As a Hebrew teacher, that capability makes BibleWorks one of my most important tools, and this new edition even more so. But this program is not just for those who work with the original text - though it is really great for that! There are many, many helps in this program for those who want to dig deeper into the Scriptures, yet, have not had time to learn the original languages.The list of included texts is astonishing, not only modern translations but the ancient texts, lexicons, and grammars of the original languages as well. Additionally, there are several textual critical databases that are also included. There are utilities for reviewing and/or learning Greek and Hebrew grammar and vocabulary, diagraming sentences copying texts into a word processor, etc. As a Hebrew teacher myself, I am excited to see the textual critical materials which have been included. Moreover, there are scans of manuscript images where they are available. Though the BW Manuscript Project is just beginning, and only includes seven Greek New Testament manuscripts, it certainly could be expanded to include many, many digital image sets for textual critical purposes. That, naturally, would add considerably to its footprint on a hard drive. Already these graphics add a little bit more than seven gigs to the footprint of this program.Within the browse window, the program allows you to switch between multiple version display and single version display with one click. How cool is that? You can also do your searches by simply double-clicking on a word within this window. As with most modern Windows programs, a right-click in this window brings up several submenus. You can search for forms of words, look things up in the included dictionaries and grammars, open a preset diagram for a text (if you are working with the NT), and even copy text into the clipboard so it can be pasted into a word processor. One of the most useful tools for me is the ability to import Scripture to my word processor without leaving the word processor! Control shift B opens a window into which you can type the verse that you want to paste into your word processor. This useful function has been with BibleWorks at least since version 3.5.The analysis window displays information gleaned from the sources within the program: grammars, lexicons, etc. One of the things that really sold me on the usefulness of this version, is the feature that enables retrieving data by means of a mouse pointer moved over a word in the browse window. Information will then pop up in the analysis window. You do not need to enter codes or go through menus to get to all of this information. If you mouse over the English word, in an English version in the browse window the analysis window will display the word from the original, a transliteration, and a rough pronunciation guide. There are also notes to the text, including commentaries, lexicons, grammars, etc. This one feature alone is worth the price of the program, as it is not only useful for those who are familiar with the original languages at every level, it is useful for those who have not had the time (yet!) to learn the original languages, also referring to the Strong's number system, something with which many folks are already familiar.A great deal of information is available using tabs in this window, especially important for those who use these reference tools, information gleaned from grammars and lexicons. These are summarized under the resources tab and from there, full articles in the lexicons and the whole context from grammars are available. Personally, I find this to be a tremendous time-saving tool. I do have these reference books in hard copy, but I am less likely to go to my shelf, pick up the book, look in the index, and read whatever the grammar has to say about my verse then I am to do a mouse over and find very quickly any reference to the verse, or even the word that I might be studying. References are also available to the church fathers and study Bibles. I still have not solved the problem of going to the expense of purchasing these books in electronic form, when I already have them on my shelf. For some of them, I went to great expense. I am not sure how to solve this problem. For those who have not yet purchased BDB, BDAG, or some of these other expensive reference volumes, the solution is easy, simply by BW! Having them in a searchable electronic format saves a lot of time and looking things up, but also a lot of space on your shelf.Textual critical notes are available in this window as well as any translator notes related to the Bible versions being used. You can also make your own notations regarding the material you are studying and save it within BW, which will connect your own thoughts on this verse to the verse itself. Here also is access to the BW Manuscript Project - the digital image sets from seven Greek New Testament manuscripts. I am very impressed with this project. It does add tremendously to the footprint of this program on your hard disk. It is fortunate that hard drive space has become so inexpensive, but as this project grows (and I hope it does, this is an exciting development!), the need for disk space for the program is going to become much greater. The Manuscript Project as it stands at this point, takes 7.5 GB of space on a hard drive - and this is only seven Greek NT manuscripts (though there is a lot of textual critical information not in graphic form, which doesn't take nearly as much space). It is likely that OT manuscripts, both Greek and Hebrew, will take up quite a bit more space. I'm excited to see how this project progresses. Also available within this window is a graphic display of the results from your search done in the first window. This will show, for instance, how many times a word occurs in a specific book and provides an immediate graphic presentation of that information. It can also be separated out to show how many times a particular word occurs in any chapter of the Bible.This window can also be split into two, allowing tabs to be compared one with another. Tabs can also be moved in between these two new columns. The advantage of being able to do this, is being able to compare information without having to get rid of one or the other or having to place it in a word processor, and then making a comparison.The videos included discuss the use of the interface, the layout and navigation, the search tools, how to use the study tools and finally how to access and use help. I don't really like to spend a lot of time using ""how-to"" videos, but these videos are so useful, I am certainly going to go through them. There is a full electronic manual, and six hours of videos. It is not like I have nothing to do in my life, however the usefulness of this program, I believe, is going to push me into watching all of these videos."
33032,1,"I've played this great game many times with my four year-old, and we both love it! It's loads of fun, with some really good humor, and offers plenty of variety to hold her interest. Rescuing the lost baby animals spread throughout the park presents some definite challenges, and she was thrilled the first time she succeeded in getting them all home to their parents. I would recommend this to anyone looking to give their kids a friendly and thought provoking introduction to the computer. It will make your child smile while learning, which is high praise in my book. Congrats to Humongous Entertainment - this game is a winner!There's one thing I don't get, maybe someone here can clue me in. How does one use the camera to take a picture of the animals? During the game, Putt Putt says to save the film for when the zoo's going to open, but the one time my daughter rescued every animal, the game ended without her getting a chance to use it, which was a disappointment, and detracted from her excitement at finishing."
15936,2,"The program is powerful, but the interface is very confusing. I've been struggling with it all day now, and i still can't get it to behave predictably. Figuring out where drawing elements are going to end up (in 3D mode) is very, very tricky. I've been through the tutorials, but i'm still deeply in trial and error mode. Frustrating.You have to keep telling it to redraw the images, otherwise you wind up with leftovers on the drawing surface.BTW, i've been a professional software developer for almost 20 years (DOS, UNIX, Windows, Pocket PC) and i'm an electrical engineer -- not a novice at this stuff!"
93770,0,"Acrobat 7 introduces much new functionality in both document review and forms creation. I found the document review functionality to be very well done and very powerfull. It has great depth as a review and markup tool. It is in the area of forms creation with Designer 7 that I found problems. First I found much of the information misleading. I was interested in some specific functionality that PRO was supposed to turn on for Viewer only users. After activating that functionality and finding that it still didn't work with Viewer, I learned that it wasn't just the PRO version of Acrobat that was needed but another Adobe server product costing tens of thousands of dollars. Kind of like giving someone a key to the bank when everything of value is stored in the vault. The second issue was one of speed. I took an existing form created in MS Word and converted it to Acrobat. That process worked well but when I added dynamic elements things slowed to a crawl. Dynamic elements are things like, areas that expaned as users type or checkboxes that show or hide form areas as needed. Everything worked, but some elements took 10 seconds to refresh on a 2.4 gig computer. Lastly a warning about the new file format used by Acrobat 7. The forms functionality provided by Designer 7 changes the Acrobat format into an entirely new file type. As such that new file type does not work with many (any ?) exiting Acrobat compatible server products. In fact it even prevents Acrobat Pro 7 from doing things like batch combining of Acrobat files. Time will most probably solve both the speed and compatibility issues. I just wish that software manufactures would provide a document showing the pluses and minus offered when upgrading to a major new release like Acrobat 7."

1577,1,The soft ware works well and was easy to install. I hate the childish look of the icons and the like. I hate little smiley face type stuff;most of us using this product have grown out of that kind of thing or should have.
79994,0,"As a previous reviewer stated, be careful what you upgrade. The prior reviewer ran into difficulty because of his prior InDesign being part of a suite. There's another gotcha on the upgrade path. Be careful if you are upgrading from Pagemaker. The upgrade versions are apparently different.Adobe has two distinct upgrade paths - Pagemaker owners (me) and another for prior versions of InDesign and CS owners. This upgrade is for the latter (non-Pagemaker) owners. I just ordered straight from Adobe in this case. Why Adobe does this is hard to understand, because the upgrade price is the same for both sets of users. Why not make one set of software recognize both user types?The Adobe site says, ""Adobe InDesign CS3 PageMaker Upgrade software is an exclusive upgrade path for licensed users of Adobe PageMaker. The inclusion of popular PageMaker tools eases the transition to InDesign CS3, while enhanced typographical and graphics support helps you take your page layout to the next level.""Seems like Adobe could have just made one upgrade product for everybody, but in a nutshell, PageMaker users beware, this upgrade sold here is apparently not for us."
24355,1,"I remember playing the game before my daughter was in school, so I was looking forward to using it when the time came this year for her to give a report on the California trail. Her teacher gave her an A+ for the diary she made of the trip. You don't have to have children to play either, just an interest in history."

54438,0,"I run SuSE at home, and have found it to be quite useful in the past. I've especially found their online KDE support section helpful, as KDE is making leaps and bounds ahead of where it was.That being said, I can't help noting how top-heavy this distibution is. My major reason for looking into Linux in the first place was the fact that it was free. Free of cost (except distribution costs,) free entirely of legal strings. SuSE has changed both of those with its policies. If you want an update to your Redhat or Mandrake distro, you generally download it. Your friends want copies? Give them copies. Nobody complains, because it's free! If you don't want to go through the manifold hassles of compiling source code every time you want to install a new piece of software, you can generally find pre-built Redhat or Mandrake etc. packages in various locations. None of this is the case with SuSE. You want updates, you pay. You want software packages, buy the update and hope what you want is there, or build your own dang packages. Let's not forget, they're bragging about 2,300 software packages. You can practically fill your hard drive with a SuSE installation, and not know what half of it does! On top of all that, they're steadily raising the prices on ""their"" software. How much of that is overhead is something I can't say. What I can say is this: SuSE is not helping to bring Linux to the user level. I'll give them 3 stars for the sheer number of apps."

31754,1,"This has got to be the best Linux distro ever. For beginners, it is so easy to install and use, while for the intermediate/guru- it allows for tweaking and tuning. This baby comes with so much software, it's simply unbelievable. I love installing from DVD-The new kernel and KDE 3.2 are welcomed advancements. My SUSE 9.1 machine simply flys! OpenOffice 1.1.1 is great too. It does everything the MS Ofice does- it can even read MS Office files. I don't miss the Windoows world one bit... as a matter of fact, now that I don't have to worry about virus attacks or spyware anymore... I can surf the Internet pretty much carefree.

I think it will be better than the others.(My father's ID is Essex Fowlks V)"
68142,1,"Let me start by saying that I love this game. It is so much like the TV game it's amazing. There are a few problems though. First, if you play this game 2 or more times a week by yourself you will find that categories begin repeating after 2 weeks or so. This can really ruin the fun when you get your friends together to play and categories keep coming up that you have already played by yourself. Second, The &quot;buzz in&quot; keys don't all have the same response time. The player with the Ctrl key always gets in before the player with the space bar, However I was still able to win using the space bar. Third, sometimes the audio does not come through and you end up wondering what player 3 said. And lastly, Alex does not always ask you to be more specific when you provide just part of the question such as &quot;what is a bee&quot; instead of &quot;what is a honey bee&quot; and you will told your response is incorrect. Having said all this I really love this game and just purchased the 2nd edition. Pete"
73472,1,"I'm sorry to see the negative reviews, but respect that there are different types of learners. Immersion generally believes that a word for word translation limits your ability to think in the new language, as your thoughts go through a type of translator instead of coming up with the word itself. We tried the demo (available online, full version) and were hooked. The ability to switched between the anglicized phoneme type, japanese phoneme type and kanji is wonderful. I agree that the content, initially, is quite limited, but we found the same thing with 2 other language learning systems. Our students were able to learn the meaning of kanji very quickly and the speaking practice with instant feedback has been invaluable. While I believe any language requires practice with real humans, this is an excellent source of instruction. Flesh it out with conversations with Japanese friends or another program (if you find one that's worthwhile, let me know) until then, expose yourself, have patience and you will be amazed and what you learn from this program."
59911,1,I received Micrsoft Office 2003 in excellant condition. The box was sealed and in good condition.The 2003 office software is easy to use if you have used any of the previous versions. Many new features make it worthwhile to upgrade.
79048,1,"Get this product if you're a savvy PC user. Then, you'll be amazed at it's functionality. If you half-the-time can't figure out how to make your PC work, then don't get this progranm as it will blow you away. Simple fact--the more powerful the software, the more knowledgeable the user must be to harvest the functionality and this is one powerful package. I run a mutil-million dollar company with it and used it when there was just one employee. So it's grown with the needs of a rapidly growing company. Other people that wrote reviews here complained about the support. If you need lots of support, again--this is not the package for you anyway. Their support is not good but who cares--can you read a manual? They have trained consultants throughout the US if you do need face to face support or customization."
69355,0,"Don't get me wrong. Money is a great product on the PC, but when Microsoft, in its infinite wisdom, migrated Pocket PC to Windows Mobile, they stopped making a MS/Money module for it. One of the great features of Money was being able to keep track of expenses when you're away from the home or office. Sure, you can carry your laptop with you, but that's not very convenient. I wish they would at least explain whey they did this."
47524,0,"I got this programme ages ago. It was one of the first programmes I brought for my computer as I've always wanted a dog, and never been allowed to have one. I hoped this would be a suitable replacement. The idea for the programme is nice, and I was very excited when I first got it. I enjoyed choosing a dog, and making up a name for it, but the novelty soon wares off. There is not much you can do with your dog except throw a ball. Although it does grow from a puppy to a full size dog. This programme may be good for children as there is no responsibility involed, not like a real pet. I would recommend getting a more recent version though as it will have better computer graphics, and from what i've heard, you can do more with the dogs. This may be cheaper, but I wouldn't say it was worth the money."
32860,2,"So I've been tinkering with this for a few hours now, and I have to say I was disappointed by how much of the cool functionality appears to be dependent on the user's knowledge of AppleScript.

82558,1,"I've used this software a few times, the first a couple years ago. I liked it because it came with everything I needed including the cables and that it walked you through step by step. They make the process easy.They also include software to clean up the old pc if you choose."
9817,1,"Simply summed up, this is the best movie of all time.Okay, okay, that's a bit of an overstatement. Here is what is is: this is a FUN movie. You watch because it's got a kickin' soundtrack, martial arts fights, and, yes, all the hooks of the video game for those who played it and wanted to see more. There are no hugely gaping holes in the plotline. In fact, there really ISN'T much of a plotline: it's just an excuse to have some weird martial artists beat each other up in exotic locations. Corny humour at times, attempts at seriousness at other times, but mostly it's just what it is: a movie about some people who are out to kick each other's butts -- and do so.NOT for: those who want a complex (or even vaguely understandable) plot; those who abhor violence; those who are finicky about the action sequences (""But, wait -- Gogrillo can't travel 17 meters in 4.3 seconds while he's carrying a battle-sword, according to his stats -- this movie is whack!"" -- yeah, people who talk like that? No, not your movie.)FOR: those who want to ignore the plot and just cheer the fight on until the popcorn goes flying; those who just loved the game and wondered what the characters were like when not in the ring; everyone who loves a basic action movie that's about having FUN!"
44,1,"First off, I have to say that I am really surprised about the negative reviews and believe their technical problems are due to their hardware/operating system limitations.That said, I must say this is the most comprehensive, beautiful, creative, fun game my daughter has.

3958,1,"I am extremely happy with what the program is supposed to do, i.e., to create extraordinary photo shows with amazing 3-D styles. One reviewer wrote, the program does not have a complete photo organizer that let you delete and add photos on your computer. The 3D-Album uses regular Windows file folder. You use Windows Explorer to add/delete photo files, copy/create photo folders, and prepare photo collections for 3D-Album to display. Then you use 3D-Album's photo organizer to attach text and voice to your photos, drag and drop to define photo orders, specify the photo displaying time and the text color, and etc. Because I am already used to Windows Explorer, it is easier for me to use Windows Explorer to prepare my photo files and folders, rather than learning an unfamiliar method in a new program (unless Windows Explorer cannot provide the way I want.) Because 3D-Album is meant to be simple, It does not try to do everything. It provides only features that are necessary to get your job done.3D-Album is definitely not a product for photo management, nor photo editing or photo printing. It is for photo presenation. I never found a photo album software that brings so much fun. It adds many wonders to my boring digital photos. If you are tired of traditional 2-D slideshows as provided by many other 2-D photo album softwares, add 3D-Album to your collection. It is a truly great software package."

48127,1,"I purchased this product one year ago and it revolutionized my learning of French, and all languages! It quickly leads you into the basics of the language using the type of concepts you would naturally first encounter such as man, woman, dog and cat instead of a grammer oriented approach (I am, your are, etc.) or a conversational approach. I bought it in Dec 2000 and after using it for a week signed up for the online course they offer for a very reasonable price. I studied with that for six months, spending about twenty to thirty minutes a day with it, and then went to France. If I had known just how effective this method was being I would have spent an hour a day and tried harder. I was amazed that I could comprehend a sufficient amount of French to get by and also to spontaneously speak. I have since purchased the entire set and the beginning Spanish also. Brillant approach to use of modern language learning techniques combined with multimedia technology."

Its an amazing piece of software.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was that the ability to draw/create on your own was a little tricky and was missing some features. Although it was not built for things like this, it would have been relatively nice (since many competitors offer similar features).Nonetheless I'm being picky. This is a GREAT program and I recommend it highly (better than Photoshop Elements)."

Earlier editions have been very good in this regard: this edition - in one word - stinks.I looked up the hotel I stay at in Washington. Not only was the hotel grossly mislocated, but so were many of the restaurants and other points of interest in the area. There is no excuse for this. Streets & Trips would have me lost.As a double-checked, I mapped the area around my home. A restaurant that closed two years is still on the map. Another local restaurant is located on the map a full block away from its actual location.I haven't tried it for routing yet and probably won't.

21853,1,"I would like to strongly recommend 3D Home Architect Deluxe 4.0, particularly over the newer version 3D Home Architect Deluxe 5.0 (Professional Version).4.0 was easy and friendly to learn. However, 5.0, isn't going to be as easy for folks unfamiliar with CAD type programs.While 5.0 over 4.0 offers extensive advantages, the biggest failure is it's inability to open previous work.Projects created with versions 4.0 cannot be opened or retrieved into 5.0. Meaning, all work will be lost.If you are looking to upgrade and work on your existing projects, stick with version 4.0. If you are starting new projects, and are familiar with CAD or have the penchant for adapting to CAD type environments 5.0 is a great choice.For me, I very well may return the product in the next few days/week maximum.Add'l objects and libraries will be available later per tech support (for a fee ?

34020,0,"I love the Nancy Drew games, they're great. All of them (sans Secrets Can Kill) have been a truly enjoyable experience for me. The Secret of Shadow Ranch is one of those enjoyable experiences. As stated in another review, though, it is not without fault(s).1. The Game Screen - Call me old-fashioned, but I tend to prefer the old game screen. It could be because I prefer being able to access my items without having to open up a new mini-window to do so, but that's my take. The larger game window isn't anything amazing, but I like it well enough. I also think that having the journal and cell phone as menu icons instead of something on your computer and an item is great. So if keeping it that way is good, then I guess I can sacrifice the old item system. Perhaps they can put the item box where it used to be, but shrink it by two icons (so it's 2x1), and put the cell phone and journal on the bar, and have the same conversation system as in SSR. Just a thought (or two).2. The Ranch Chores - ND has been making lots of progress with the feel of their games lately (actually since Secret of the Scarlet Hand), with their more organic attitude towards puzzles and activities. However, the ranch chores are annoying. Not only can you get kicked out of the ranch for doing them incorrectly (picking an unripe veggie or two?), but you do them three times during the three days over which the game transpires. And speaking of puzzles...3. Puzzles - Now, with a lot of this game being based on a &quot;brain-vexing&quot; treasure hunt, this may be too far. It seems as though HI threw some puzzles in just to extend the game. Like the ranch chores, the puzzles can become annoying at times (such as a puzzle where you must navigate four magnetic beads through a maze that is partially hidden by wood). The hints throughout the game for puzzles and other such things are almost giveaways at times. I also tend to feel that Nancy shouldn't have to rely on the internet and phone friends for so much of the game, but I suppose it's less annoying that flipping through a &quot;book&quot; to find the info.All in all, it was great. But these flaws are upsetting after the wonder that was DODI, which is HI's crowning achievement to date. Hopefully all that was good in DODI will return in the next installment: The Curse of Blackmoor Manor."

She and her friends especially love to pick their teams from the bleacher full of kids, and getting to see how they are rated on individual skills.

84378,1,"There are some quirks to Vista. It's not always very intuitive either. But then again all things have some learning curve to them. Generally I have been very happy with Vista. If I had to guess why there are so many problems with other users is they use Vista as an upgrade, not bothering to flattening/formatting their hard drives and beginning afresh. There are plenty of tips that can be found online to solve most problems otherwise and most of these tips are just familiarizing people with Vista.The only real compliant I have about Vista Ultimate, and maybe all the Vistas, is that although you are listed as the administrator, you're a protected administrator without true full rights. I used Spybot SnD and it would not allow me to remove all the adaware because I was not a true administrator. Only after unlocking the full rights and logging on the true administrator could I remove them. YUCK and what a pain."
22334,0,"I am really pleased with this product for its notation and composition elements as I am working on piano scores; however, there are a few things that were not that great. Because of the echo on my keyboard, I can't play realtime and have the program score what I am playing. Rather, I am scoring by clicking in each note which is pretty time-consuming. There were a few suggestions in the manual as to how to get rid of the echo (which BTW creates double notes all over your score) but none of them worked on my particular keyboard. Also, you can only create a ""pedal"" marking by physically pressing the pedal (creating a midi event) but this didn't work for me (See above problem). Also, the lyric function (Adding lyrics to your score) is very limiting because you can only tie one word to one note unless you hyphenate it and sometimes this is not possible. Overall, I have been able to score 6 songs successfully but am recording them in a separate studio b/c the quality of playback isn't that great with this program. Hope this helps you!"
85772,1,"I bought this for each PC we have in the family. For 20 years I have supported both friends and family (free of charge, of course) and a few times times I have had to deal with crashed hard drives. Now I tell people that if they aren't using Ghost, don't even think of calling me. If they don't want to spend the money because they think I can work miracles, it isn't worth my time. Some things are miracles, and getting all of your stuff back is one of them.I have used it successfully with external SATA drives with XP and most recently used it on my wife's new Vista PC and an external USB drive.I stayed home today to get my car inspected (no problems). After that, I just started building a new Vista PC for myself. After loading Vista and MS Office I will back it up with Ghost.If you don't use it and your machine crashes, your problems really are of your own making when there is a product like this available."
26752,0,"I have utilized many versions of StreetFinder for years. I was hoping that Microsoft Streets was more user friendly than StreetFinder.So sad. It IS more expensive.

2775,2,"I finally decided I had enough of Microsoft Money and decided to upgrade to the #1 quicken 2007. Per Quicken there is an easy conversion. This is not true. You have to download a conversion program and it does not successfully convert a money database. After spending three hours manually entering all of my data, I found this version of quicken slow and not easy to use. To Purchase stocks the software can not even compute the amount of shares given the purchase price and amount invested. All fields must be manually entered. Funds must be transfered into the softwares cash account even if a direct stock purchase is made, and then the second step of purchasing the stock has to be made. Even though the software has the latest stock price, you have to look up and manually enter it. I found the additional time and multiple steps to perform simple transactions are not worth the time. Back to MS Money for me."

25570,1,"The Norton Antivirus is good virus protection software. I previously had Norton Antivirus 2002, and 2003 is a great improvement over it. The 2003 version automatically scans for updates, whereas the 2002 popped up to let you know updates were available, but you had to do several things to prompt it to check for updates. This can be set to do a total scan for viruses automatically once a week. This is an easy, convenient choice for antivirus protection on your computer."

This is stored on the ""C"" drive. If you have partitioned your hard drive and reduced the ""C"" drive store then you'll find the ""C"" drive will fill up quickly!I wrote the company and they say they are working on a patch to allow the user to decide where to store the downloaded video files.A minor complaint is that the windows don't retain the location on the screen when opening and closing the program.My software came bundled with the new ATI TV Elite card, but it's the same version 3."

In addition, it's interactive tutorials have proven to be better than your typical textbook.I myself, at the moment, am very reliant towards my calculator. Physics tutor's questions however are meant to be done without a calculator, so it is very effective if you are studying or preparing for your SAT II.Physics tutor will make things easy for you in class, on homework, and on tests."
67589,2,"This is a subscription-based game. It says so inside the box in very small print. You get 2 levels with the game but you have to unlock anything beyond that. It is about $75 annually or $8 per month.I missed that part. I thought I got a great deal (Costco $11) for this game and was really pissed off when I realized I have to pay so much more for this game.One more annoying note - the game includes educational games (level based) and various activities such as drawing, playing with a virtual dog, planting virtual flowers, etc. The problem is that if you want to move to the next level of the educational games, you have to complete a ton of time-wasting activities and earn badges. I don't mind my daughter playing the non-educational parts but she literally has to spend twice as much time on them than on the ""real"" stuff. Having it a requirement to move up a level seems like a very silly requirement.Had I known about these issues before I bought the game, I probably wouldn't have purchased it."
53614,1,"I have fancied myself a good Boggle player since I was introduced to the original game more than 20 years ago ... It's been difficult to find people willing to play with me! (: I purchased the CD early this year, and now play it regularly over the internet (at www.zone.com/boggle - you do need to have the CD to play there) - and it's often a humbling experience! They also regularly have tournaments at that site which are a lot of fun. You can also become &quot;ranked&quot; as a ladder player if you wish (at www.igl.net/zboggle). I don't know what it is about this game, but I could play it every day without tiring of it. Getting to &quot;meet&quot; other players of all skill levels has been great as well. It's also fun just to play against the computer, which has several skill levels to challenge you. There are a number of variations on the original game (BreakAway, Battle, Space, and In Your Face), but to me the Classic Master is the best."
8731,1,"Our son loves this game so much (he received it for his birthday two days ago), we can hardly get him to do anything else! Even adults will enjoy assisting the child ""drive"" Thomas and complete the chores given to Thomas by Sir Topham Hat. Your child will see the stations, the other engines, listen to Thomas speak to him (or her), and even see Thomas from above at certain points (e.g., entering a station). Most views are from ""inside"" Thomas, and I think it's a particularly nice touch to see Thomas' firebox burning. Warning: The gamepiece only fits on regular keyboards, not ergonomic ones (i.e., those split-looking keyboards). I recommend this product highly if your child is a Thomas fan. PS - it will install on Windows XP, which I understand has been a problem for some other Thomas games."

65372,1,"I found this software very helpful, I was very hapy with the purchase!It comes with 4 CD for PC,1 audio CD (which has just 2 Lessons and I do not think it is so helpful, because all the pronounced words you can find anyway in the software)1 WORK BOOK - which I found great.The best thing about the software is that it IS organized and follows the book step by step. All the words (from the workbook) are pronounced in the software - there are some video clips, you can record your voice and compare with a native speaker, you can play games and puzzels and OF course - you can take tests!!There are all answears for the tests and exercises (at the end of the workbook) and the GRAMMAR explanations are great!I really like this software - I even looked for buying another one from the same company (for intermediate or advance students)."
38914,0,Windows is good for several things. But being flexible is NOT one of them. The issue with this product is you can't use it on all of your PC's if you have more than one. You have to buy this for each and every one of them. Its a rip-off to have to do that.
45475,1,"I upgraded to Studio 9 several weeks ago and used it to render a large project. I took over 15 hours of event video and reduced it to a 1 hour DVD. I'm working on a Dell 1.5Ghz Workstation, with 256Meg of RAM (more on order), and 300+Gigabytes of disk storage.Here was my experience.No problems with installation. It uninstalled Studio 8 and reinstalled Studio 9 without a hitch. I then downloaded the 9.0.2 upgrade and update without any issues.I was able to capture some 15 hours of raw video (about 17 13Gigabyte AVI files) without any problems. The video came from both Digital 8 and Mini-DV cameras both of which Studio 9 handled well. I really liked the record in reduced mode option which was a nice way to reduce disk usage. Working with this many files and data was no problem for Studio 9. I jumped around between the files and sucessfully built the storyboard. I ended up with around 240 clips and transistions in the final video. Towards the end things got really sluggish, especially when editing audio, and I would have to patiently wait for Studio 9 to ""do it's thing"" before adding or editing the next clip but it never hung or core dumped. However, I did find myself just quiting the program on occasion to clean up memory and speed things up a bit.Where I did find real problems was in the Effects area, both audio and visual. I tried to use the Stabalize effect on some jerky video and had some initial success. When I then tried to apply it across numerous jerky shots it actually made the video considerably worse. And it was a cumulative effect. The more shots that were sequenced together the worse the effect was. I removed that effect on most of the shots and used it sparingly on the worse offenders and that worked ok.In the audio effects I had a similiar experience. I had a whole string of outdoor shots with people and lots of wind noise. I tried using the Wind reduction effect on a single clip and it reduced wind sound. So then I applied it to the entire 20 shot sequence. Bad idea. Now I can't render the movie. Each time it gets into that section Studio 9 stops rendering. It doesn't freeze Studio 9 it just stops rendering - sitting on the same frame for hours. I am able to kill the render but each time I retry it does the same thing. I finally suspect that it is the Noise reduction code, remove it from the 20 shot sequence and everything now renders fine.I did find one area that will hang up Studi 9 every time. That was in selecting effects. If I looked at several effects (like stabalise, B&W; video, fun effect, etc) in sequence, looking for that ""right"" effect for a shot, it would hang Studio 9 every time. I learned to never look at more than two effects in sequence before exiting the effects area. Eventually I knew what effect Studio 9 had and then could just go straight to the desired effect and apply it to a scene. This worked with no problems.Last area of frustration was mentioned already by another reviewer - adding CD Music. I finally figured out the correct sequence for making it work but only after several hours of frustration. It defaults to placing all CD Music inserts to the front of the timeline even though you started with the cursor on the time tick where you want the music to go. The secret is to reset the cursor to the desired input frame immediatly before hitting the add-music button. Then it will work elsewise it stuffs the music at the head of timeline. WIth a big project this becomes a major nuisance to drag the music back to the correct time mark.Those were the four big issues I had, none of which stopped me in my tracks. I have not reported these to Studio 9 support yet because, given my experience from 8.0, their answer will be ""reload the software"" or some other completly meaningless answer.My overall evaluation is positive and I will continue to work with it though I look anxiously for the 9.1 upgrade. It makes working with video and audio clips very easy. We were able to pull off some pretty fancy tricks with this software.It does have a lot of power for a $100 software package and in the end it worked well for me."

2966,2,"I write music for a living and decided to give MasterWriter a shot a few months ago. I used it for about a week straight and decided that the old-fashioned way of using Mac Pages and an internet rhyming website/thesaurus was more efficient for me. MasterWriter is clunky -- the interface seems to have been designed from someone still stuck in the late 90s computer-wise. Often things don't do what they're supposed to on the first try, and the overall experience (believe me, I gave it a chance) left me regretting that I shelled out the money for it. It's also quite slow at times.It's too bad because the rhyming and thesaurus features could be truly fantastic and are better than what's out there on the web because of how they're hypothetically integrated -- it's just the way that they're implemented that leaves someone who's used to the way modern programs work with a lot desire.They need to hire programmers who are hip to the modern age of computing and work flow."
71299,1,Star Office is the best software value I have ever used. I don't know why so many people use Microsoft's expensive program when Star Office does everything it will do and sometimes better.

It stores, creates, organizes, and manages my estimates, invoices, as well as purchase orders. I have all the information that I need in one central location that is simple to navigate. Due to the ease of use it cuts down on the time it takes to an estimate and it keeps me on top of my billing. I would recommend this application, from one business owner, to another"
76916,0,"The card works fine in the large cities. You do have to know the exact streets otherwise Garmin will not find them for you (in contrast, TomTom gives suggestions). As street names are long and complex in Brazil, this can leave you with lots of tries before you get to the street you need to go. It also mistakingly directs you to go left where it is not allowed to go left which is the usual case in Sao Paulo. Last but least, you miss a lot of Brazil on the card, e.g. Buzios is not on there, nor is the Sao Paulo Coast. In all, it is worthwhile to have this device to navigate Belo, Sao Paulo and Rio as these cities are huge and navigating them is a complex task."
44735,1,"I found very little wanting in this product. The maps are incredibly accurate, even for areas far from city centers. My only complaint is that the interface does not behave the same as it does when looking at the built-in maps of North America. Many cities, for example, do not appear until the map is zoomed-in on the region, and only then does the map for that area load and zooming out is again possible. Before I discovered this trick I was under the impression that very few metropolitan areas were covered. Only after zooming in to the neighborhood level did the right panel load, and it was possible to see the full layout of that country or region.The map also seems very recent. Some streets we did not expect to find were in fact on the map, so there is little to complain in this regard. I was also happy with the price. Definitely beats buying a dedicated unit for Europe."
84804,1,"I have found this application to work very well on OS X Snow Leopard. Although I am still unable to register (what's up Intuit?), I have not had the program crash on me, something that used to happen all the time running Windows Quicken 2009 through Parallels. By the way, this issue is not a problem with Parallels or Windows according to many discussion boards. Many people complain that the Mac version does not have as many features as the Windows version, but I have found that I never used many of those features. I pay bills, manage my investments, and track values of my assets. What else is there to do with personal financial software? The Mac version still reads QIF files, a highly valuable feature that has been removed from the Windows version. Yes the software needs Rosetta to run and doesn't have the ""eye candy"" like some of the more modern Mac software apps, but the other Mac financial software packages simply cannot do all that Quicken for Mac can. It's not easy to switch from the Windows to Mac version, but Intuit provides a step by step ""how to"" on their web site. I followed it and have had no problems. I bought it a really good price from Amazon, and don't ever intend to go back to the Windows version. It got to be a real pain to have to load Windows every time I needed to open Quicken."

The lasting appeal won't last long i just use it to sharpen my math skills, two things i don't like about it is one: when you get a problem wrong it doesn't tell you how you should've solved it like it doesn't give you the steps in solving it and two: some of the math problems are really to hard for me to solve (i wasn't very good at math so don't judge haha) like the area, diameter, circumference, radius and perimeter ETC. I would say this program is more for high school students. but overall a good educational game"

The first ten comics in each of marvel's famous line-up (Though X-Men starts with Giant Sized X-Men #1, not the Uncanny X-Men). All in all you get the 100 comics that started the Marvel mythology and launched its beloved characters into our imagination. Some of these comics go for thousands and are impossible to find except in reprints like the &quot;Essentials&quot; collections (Highly recommended as well if you want more than just the first ten issues) but with the miracle of CD's and computers you don't need to go out and buy those comics or reptints to see your favorite hero's origin.If you're a fan of Marvel Comics and haven't read these original stories then what are you waiting for!

NIS2005 is a mess. It is a massive resource hog. There are many incompatibility issues. It is showing up in all the tech forums with major Install/Uninstall problems.

13734,1,"If you want a good security progam that's not a resrouce hog this is the best of what I've seen.I had a prior version Norton Internet Security and was very pleased with it. I ignored poor reviews and complaints about recent versions of NIS and upgraded when the older version was no longer supported. I should have heeded the reviews as all their problem became mine. It noticeably slows down your computer, your email, your web browsing...and has applicaiton errors when you shutdown/log off windows.After one month I took a risk and purchased Zone Alarm 2006 and have been extremely pleased. No, it's not ""perfect"" but it works well, actually seems to catch things NIS didn't and it doesn't slow down the computer (noticeably better performance than NIS).Like NIS it does occassionaly have some program errors when shutting down or logging off...but **much** fewer than NIS..and I think they only occur after the pc has hibernated (which seems to be a common issue with a lot of software).The alerts that ZA pop up whenever a program first attempts to access the internet (or ZA when suspects it could compromise security) are probably excessive and somewhat cryptic for the average user....but you can tell ZA to not ask you again. And you get use to the alerts...and these days it's far better to have a security program have a few too many of these alerts than to just assume.As a web programmer I have to use McAfee at work and it's such a hog I always have to commit the sin of turnning it off whenever I'm doing anything complex (big program builds, installs).Everybody likes something different for different reasons. I mainly want a product to work..and to not cause grief to my computer, other programs or my work. ZA 2006 definitely meets all these requirements and has won me over."

21321,1,"Primarily based on the new PBS kids television show, Liberty's Kids, the computer game brings to life the history of the American Revolution perfect for children 9-12, the ages when American History is first taught to the kids. After having tried the game out and playing it several times, I was astonished to find that the characters you need to interview(whom require certain items) change their interviews, places and different items. This is the perfect thing to keep kids interested, especially since they might think they can outsmart the game by going to the same places and getting the same people interviewed every time.I loved the game Liberty's Kids because it depicted the events very truthfully and made sure that kids could get all sides of the stories. One of the best parts is that children can learn about, not only the main characters, such as Benedict Arnold, George Washington and Abigail Adams, but explore Ben Franklin's print shop and learn about the inventions he made. Bravo to the creators of Liberty's Kids, the computer game and TV show."
24257,1,"I bought this game based mostly on the great reviews here. My dissatisfaction with this software is my own fault for not paying more attention to the description of the game which says the software deals with the ""basic fundamentals of mathematical thinking as organizing information, reasoning of evidence, finding and making patterns, and systematic testing of hypotheses."" Look at that description again. No where does anything say this software is about adding, subtracting, multiplying or division problems. Even the title, LOGICAL Journey implies deductive reasoning. So please don't take my harsh review as being critical of the software itself. It's a good game for doing what it was designed to do which is to teach logical reasoning and deduction. However, if you are like me and looking for math PROBLEMS like add this number to this other number you won't find any of that here. Let me say it again in case it isn't clear yet. I could not find one single arithmetic problem in this whole game."

There does not seem to be any way to change colors on the register display as there has been in previous versions. The old one click backup function is totally gone and has been replaced with some application called Windows XP CD Burning. Apparently, you have to use this function in XP to make a backup to a CD-RW. In the past, you just clicked on backup, indicated the location, and away you went. This process is a disaster and I have been unable to get it to work - even after going to the Intuit website for further information. To add to all of this, there is not a way to contact Intuit without incurring costs to get answers to these issues.I am very disappointed in this product and, as another reviewer stated, I may just revert back to Quicken 2003 Deluxe.I would not recommend that you purchase this product."

Although this version particularly improved on integration with GPS and tried to add navigation functionalities, it is still very rudimentary. It's surprised to see how rigid and limited functionality this one has, when compared with a decent PDA based navigation software, such as TomTom. It hangs for 1 minute or longer when I try to use COM port to connect to my Bluetooth GPS unit. It takes a simple GPS program downloaded from web less than 1 sec to do the same thing. No 3D view mode for the map, which is a common feature for most PDA navigation softwares. Again, this is more suited for stationary use, rather than navigation."

43576,1,This item was a great buy. It was shipped in a few days as promised and I installed it in my computer with no problems at all. This product sells for a lot more in stores even on sale so you will not be sorry that you bought this product online...no taxes and free shipping. I definitely recommend this product.
63556,2,"Intuit cannot seem to provide a remedy for validation of their product keys. Even following their own website's recommended process for updating the product (which includes copying the tax data file to a temporary directory, uninstalling the product, re-installing the product), the activation issue renders TurboTax more trouble than its worth. You'll spend a good couple hours (at least) with an uninformed (at best) customer service representative on this issue. No more TurboTax."
949,1,"I love this program. As a beginner learning without lessons I was able to pick up plenty of chords from books. The problem for me was learning proper timing and strumming techniques. You cannot get that information from a book; you need someone to show you. This CD does that.I noticed another user warning that the program does not run well on new computers. However, I have a P4 with XP pro and all the updates and it runs fine for me."
11271,2,"The program was not as easy as I thought I would be. I was not able to print working drawings only a list of materials in even tht was only general nothing specific. I was a little disappointed in it's lack of features and difficuty with commands (mostly keyboard and low use of the mouse). For the price fair, but it could have been better."
34184,0,"I have been using Streets and Trips for 6 years, getting a new version when it came out. When reviewing past releases, they have almost always deserved 5 stars. This year, it gets 1 star (at best). Okay, it is still great for new users (it is my map software of choice), but I am tired of reporting errors and nothing is corrected.We have a street that is NOT a thru-street (not even connected) and has been that way for 8 years. When people use S&T;, they end up going out of the way, if not getting lost, and wasting a lot of time. I reported this 9 months ago and was hopeful. Dang! They still got it wrong!This is not my first time with incorrect maps. About 4 years ago, I ended up having to drive an extra 30 miles because the maps on S&T; were wrong.This is getting infuriating. Is it because it got outsourced or something? I mean, come on, something that I notified them of (with GPS coordinates no less!)? Add that to the other complaints and I might do what I did with Money 2004 this year -- skipped it for the first time in a long time.Microsoft, if you treat your customers like this, you will find yourself losing revenues and market share. And NO, it is NOT due to piracy. Geez.Edit: okay, I got to give some credit for the new changes. With the addition of clear exits on highways and one-way indications, it boosts its rating."
41805,1,"I like this game a bit more than my kids do. The game is very simple and can be mastered by my pre-schoolers with basic mousing skills. My biggest complaints about the game are (1) the small number of puzzles causes re-runs during the same session, and (2) the graphics are like 1995 quality and look pretty poor on a newer PC with HD resolution on a 24"" monitor. An technology update, and a few new puzzles would make this a more appealing offering.That said, I still find the game amusing and mildly educational, and it has been good for helping my 2 year old develop his mousing skills. As for reading coaching, it might help a little, but other games such as ItsaBitsa do a much better job and making small kids think about the connection with printed words on the screen and speech."

33090,1,I read the other reviews and have to say that I loved the storyteller. I use an epson printer and it wasn't hard to print. It works better when you use the user defined custom setting to print the cover instead of the panoramic. I also printed the pages borderless and it looks like I sent it out to a professional printing service. Thanks Epson

25021,0,"My son's had this game a while (I'm assuming it's the Hasbro Interactive branded game) and recently we upgraded his PC to XP.Of course the game didn't work, but by selecting Properties on the game icon you can move to a Compatibility tab and run the game in 98/ME mode - Works fine like that.Ryan's 7 now and the game is simple, but he still enjoys it from time to time, for its attractive graphics and Ringo's familiar naration.I'd recommend this to anyone with a youngster interested in Thomas. Before we had this Ryan never went near the PC, now he's computer literate above his age (not entirely due to this game, but it piqued his interest)."

65445,1,"I purchased Copy Commander at on the advice of my brother-in-law who is a Systems Administrator at a large electronics company. I had a pretty decent computer with a lot of data with old programs that are no longer supported. The simplest solution was to install a new hard drive. The new drive must be larger than the drive to be cloned.This particular computer wouldn't recognize the HDD with the dual ribbon cable, so I ended up connecting it to the mother board via the CD-ROM cable. Once that was accomplished, replicating the drive went flawlessly. The computer now has a new lease on life."
91882,1,I bought the Pod rescue program because I had recently purchased a new laptop (Vista OS) and need to add the music from two iPods (30Gb Video and 3G iPhone) to this new laptop.

55212,0,"The software insisted that I own a business, and would not let me select otherwise. I contacted their technical support via live chat (I will NOT pay for telephone support over a problem in THEIR product). I had to tell the tech exactly what the problem was 3 TIMES (he kept asking). Finally, I was switched to another rep, and had to go through the same mess again. This person told me to try some steps. While I was doing that, he/she ENDED THE CHAT SESSION! No warning, just dropped it. Turned out the steps I was given did not solve the problem, and I had to re-contact them and tell the story yet again.Poor communication, not paying attention to what I say, and they never did resolve the problem. I had to work around it for myself.If you buy TurboTax, be warned: if you need technical support, you're better off on your own."

38698,1,"I've just had this game for a day, but I already know it's going to be great! The graphics are really good, not fuzzy or grainy, and the characters move around easily. Some parts are quite challenging, (I've made good use of the hint button!) but very fun. I expected the battles to be very graphic, like the books, but they're not, it's not a game about blood and guts, nor is it just about killing. There are puzzles as well as the fighting scenes, and a lot of races against the clock. It's really good! I definitely recommend it to Animorphs fans, as well as people who want a fun, challenging game to play!I just have one little question. In Chapter Two, the rooftop action scene, how do you jump up from the area following the the three fans to the building above it? I can't get it! If anyone knows, could they please post it here for me? Thanks so much!"

I have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos.I do have two other imaging programs,and with the addition of Elements,I feel like I'm basically well-set with zillions of options.Plus,there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography,and they supply free downloads of Photoshop samples, such as ""textures,"" and so on.Very helpful.Get this if you can't spring for the complete Photoshop program. You will not be disappointed."
53216,1,"While there are some quirks to this system, you can't go wrong for the money. I use this unit while servicing customer systems in multiple states. This system is invaluable in navigating unfamiliar territory. I'd prefer it to be more detailed in it's actual guidance in that I'd prefer it to tell me what direction to head not just to merge onto the highway. This works like a charm everywhere but Manhattan."
53221,1,"On a recent vacation I utilized all of the capabilities of this product and was plesantly surprised. The GPS function performed flawlessly and the various functions worked very well. Since I had a laptop, this program saved me the purchase of a much more costly unique GPS driving product. This product was only $80 compared to nearly $350 for the closest GPS unit like TOm Tom or Garman. It does all the things that the higher cost products do and gives me the added benefit of the larger laptop display. My only downside is the road constuction update from the web was far from accurate. Many road projects that had obviously been underway for some time but were not in the database download."
58328,1,This was my first Nancy Drew game and I never read the books. I enjoyed Secrets can Kill a lot but the difficulty is way to much for the average 10 and up child. Still it was extremely fun. A must play!
25622,2,"In theory it is a very good program. I had many problems downloading. After 3 weeks of e-mails I finally got an answer back, which didn't solve the problem. You can call customer service if you are up to waiting on the phone for 45 minutes. I don't have that kind of time to waste on hold. I solved the problem by uninstalling Norton and installing a McAfee program."
94513,1,I have been a computer expert for ten years. Symantec is by far the leader in antivirus software. If you simply install the software and do not complicate the installation you will never have a problem. People that complain think they know a lot about computers and complicate the software. It easy to use and will save you a lot of time and money.

Make sure you have a good MIDI Sequencer for your computer that you know how to use or is easy to learn. You do have to wait a few minutes every time you open the plugin for the sounds to load into your RAM, but once it's loaded it works fine. This is a good buy!"

82006,0,"As another reviewer said, the furniture selections are very limited and fairly lame in appearance. That includes lamps, rugs, accessories etc, too. You will not be able to duplicate a space that you see in the design magazines, but you will be able to get a general idea of what your space will look like in terms of color combinations and furniture arrangement. The object selections are just not comprehensive enough. The software is fairly stable, but slow ( I am using a 1.7ghz computer with almost 1 gb of memory). The camera controls are awkward, but usable. For painting, there are many colors to choose from and its easy to show different combinations. Floor plan layout is good. I did not need to get precise, so I do not know how it would hold up in a more serious application.This could be 5 star software if the object library was made more comprehensive and the camera controls were more user friendly."
9904,1,"Guess what? I would have honestly liked the frenchise better were Kombat spelled with a &quot;C&quot;. Nevertheless, like all popular-concept-to-film productions, Mortal Kombat carries that special charm for those who have played the game, but will end up in the closets of those who simply don't like this type of film.There are three things which give substance to the film: a) the characters - most of them actually made it from the game into the film, and, unlike some other films, actually have viable parts rather than mere cameo appearances; b) special effects - this is Matrix of 1995. I'm being completely frank when I say that the special effects in MK are more pleasing to the eye and less off-the-wall than those in Matrix. The special effects are superb, and, unlike the above-mentioned film, they are incorporated into the rest of the film, and, moreover, they actually make sense; c) the atmosphere - creepy, gloomy, and otherwise fascinating, the atmosphere is perhaps the only aspect of this film that will cause even the most outspoken MK protestant to sit and watch. The views and landscapes are extremely atmospheric, believable, and original, and, unlike most newer films, darkness is used as an intelligent plot device, and, moreover, it is used sparingly, just to prevent the viewer from becoming hopelessly bored;This is a very, very successfl translation from different media, and, without doubt, will appeal to any fan of martial arts movies (the ones with Jacky Chan and Jean-Claude Van-Damme, not the real ones). Plenty of chop-socky action will certainly offset the realization that the film's plot can be expressed in a single sentense."

18047,0,"The hardware is frustratingly close to being usable. Unfortunately it forces you to remove the palm cover which makes handheld use challenging. It's often slow to acquire a lock.The software is nearly useless, a major disappointment. I've tried a number of palm GPS apps (the device is NMEA compliant and works well with all of them), and would rank streetfinder as the worst, for all the reasons mentioned in other reviews, and for others (a 3 CD package intended for use with laptops!).My favorite palm GPS app is solus pro 2.0, which uses compact vector maps you generate online on the delorme.com website, and can use bulky, unscalable, bitmap maps (and directions) generated using delorme street atlas USA on a non-internet-connected PC.In summary, if I had it to do over again, I'd get a standalone GPS with a serial cable, and would buy delorme street atlas and solus pro 2.0. That way I could upgrade out of the palm III form factor if I wanted to. I am happy enough with it to have replaced my III with a IIIxe so I'd have enough room for maps."

41354,1,"I found the Printmaster Platinum 16 to be relatively user friendly, even for those who haven't tried using similar products before. But I also found it frustrating to frequently change the CD while attempting to create a card because the particular image needed was stored on a different one. I have changed the CD up to 3 times just for one card. I've used other printing programs where all the images were stored on the same CD, which was much more convenient. I'm not sure if 4 CD's are used because there is such a large volume of images available. I did enjoy having many more graphic images to select from than I'd had in the past."
94876,1,"I've had good experiences with Norton products, and a friend recommended upgrading to SystemWorks 2005. The installation horror stories I read here gave me some second thoughts, but I bought it anyway. My installation and activation were smooth and uneventful - everything worked on the first try. I haven't noticed any system slow-downs, either. My friend has had some annoying hassles with reactivating it after major system upgrades, but I don't expect to encounter that any time soon. One disappointment - I had 4 months left on my Norton AntiVirus subscription, which were superceded by the new one-year SystemWorks subscription."

It would be wonderful to know that the program was catching everything all the time! I upgraded from Security 2006
34432,0,"I regret paying for this program and am thinking of going back to using Chessbase 8 (the previous version). There are bugs and annoyances that the previous version didn't have.One of the most annoying bugs is when you click in the upper right corner to exit a game annotation. The program asks if you want to save it, and if you click yes, will often overwrite some other game in the database. It's unbelievable they haven't fixed this problem yet, as it can cause someone to permanently lose their work. Using Ctrl S to save the game works though, so there is a workaround. I was used to the other method in ChessBase 8 as it worked there, and is faster.Another annoyance occurs when searching for games in the reference database. You set up the position, click on 'edit', select 'find the position in', and select the database you want to search. If you select the reference database, you are not prompted for any other parameters (like players, tournaments, etc.) and the search just takes off. This didn't happen in the previous version, you were given the option to further subset the selection criteria. The workaround on this is to have the reference database also selected as the current working database, and click on that for the selection. This method is time consuming, as you will almost always have another database highlighted when you want to do a search.If I didn't have Chessbase 8 to compare against, I might not be complaining. The product is practically a necessity for anyone that wants to research games and openings. It's ability to open many boards at once, outside the environment window, is a nice feature that most other database programs don't have.About the only feature I use, that the previous version does not have, is the ability to click on column headings to change the order in which games are displayed.Overall, I didn't see much of an improvement in this product over the previous release. That, along with the bugs, made it a dubious purchase to me.Postscript: 10/03/07Chessbase now offers a newer version called ChessBase Light as of somewhere around June of this year (2007). That version appears to have all the features of the ChessBase 9.0 program, but costs half as much. Also, the bug involving hitting x to end an annotation, seems to be fixed on that version. I don't know why they called the new version 'light', as if anything, it's an improved ChessBase 9.0. ChessBase light can be downloaded for free from their website. After it's installed, there's an option to register it on-line which will unlock all the features."

9753,0,"You know those movies that you know you should theoretically hate -- they're cheesy, they're weird, and they're predictable.But somehow... you just can't do it. ""Mortal Kombat"" is a cheesy, weird, predictable movie that is basically all about an Evil-For-The-Sake-Of-Being-Evil Villain, some wooden characters, and and an expanse of over-the-top action sequences. But somehow it's so unpretentiously video-gamish (well, DUH) that it's impossible to hate.Brief backstory: Mortal Kombat (with a K!) is a once-a-generation tournament in which fighters battle for the sake of their respective worlds. If the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil minions win this one, he gets the Earth.And he's successfully manipulated three humans into going: Liu Kang (Robin Shou) who wants to avenge his brother, actor Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) who wants to revive his career, and agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson) who wants to avenge her dead partner. They're guided by the mysterious thunder god Raiden (Christopher Lambert), who... doesn't fight. He's just kind of a Yoda.But even before the three fighters arrive at the island where the tournament will take place, they're confronted by danger -- Shang Tsung has brought his deadliest three fighters to destroy all three of them, and they don't care much about rules. Can the gang overcome their personal issues and win Mortal Kombat? Can you guess? Do I even need to ask?I openly admit it: I have never played ""Mortal Kombat"" video games, so I had no preconceptions about what this movie would be like.As for what it actually is like: a lot like watching an action anime when they get to the inevitable tournament -- lots of creative action scenes involving flames, ice-balls, a guy with four arms, and people wandering through a shadowy, cobwebbed palace. It's mindless, overserious, cheesy fun and... somehow it doesn't bother me.And I won't sugarcoat it: this is a plotless, bubblegum movie with all the important twists phoned in about ten minutes before they happened. I mean, did anyone NOT think Shang Tsung would shapeshift into Liu Kang's brother at some point to mess with his head? OF COURSE HE WOULD. AND DID. But somehow I can't hate it. It's just... kinda fun.The actors are mostly of the they're-okay-but-not-great -- Shou is pretty likeable as Liu Kang despite the random tantrums he has, Wilson is mildly annoying, Ashby's one-liners are so annoying that you'll want to drop an anvil on him (""I pay money, you carry the bags""), and Lambert is hugely underused. But Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is weirdly fun as Shang Tsung -- he always seems to be sitting halfway between ""affably evil"" and just EVIL.""Mortal Kombat"" is cheesy, cliched but still somehow entertaining -- perhaps it's all the more entertaining because you know you're only in it for the buttkicking."
31126,2,"This product has a lot clip art, but is hard to use. Although I have a 2.4 GHz PC, it still takes about 30 seconds for the application to open. When I import photos, PrintMaster seems to alter (diminish) the quality. For example, when I import high-quality photos into PrintMaster and then print them as part of a greeting card, the photos look very grainy. Borders are available as clip art, but are hard to re-size to fit around objects (there appears to be no specific tool for creating borders). Also, THE REBATE AD IS MISLEADING. YOU NEED TO OWN A COMPETING PRODUCT AND RETURN THE DISK BACK TO BRODERBUND TO GET YOUR REBATE."

77734,1,"This is a solid full feature backup software for home and small business. Due to all the features and flexibility of the software it's not easy to understand for computer adverse people. If you have difficulty understanding how to configure your computer and network through your control panel this product is too difficult for you.I've set this up on a older computer not used very much with a 200Gb hard drive on a network. Installed client software on all the other computers that I want backed up. Mapped the computers and created restore discs in case of hard drive crash (especially laptops since it's crashed twice). I also created several restore points of my main computer so that I don't have to worry of installing new softwares or trial softwares. Great feature of this software is it will copy all files of a system even if it's locked and running.If any of the system starts to slow down significantly, trial software installs spyware/rootkit or causes system instability I just restore the entire hard drive. I do the same with the kid's computer since they're constantly downloading and installing games.Other files such as My Document folders and images I've identified separatly and are backed up at a set schedule. Rest of the operating system and software does not have to be backed up as often. Software works great and very fast even over the network. It can also back up files you have open and working on. Backing up first time takes bit longer but it's still faster than drag-and-drop over the network. After the first backup only new and changed files are backed up.Again, I would only recommend this product to someone who's comfortable around computers and understand some basics on back-up, why there's multiple backup sets, how to map network computers, etc. It can be installed and used as a single computer backup but you wouldn't use so much of it's capability. Plus there's cheaper and simple software out there that can do single computer file backup.Great software with lot's of heavy duty feature but maybe to difficult for a computer newbie."

84933,1,"First, there is new version coming out in February 2010 that is suppose to be a huge update so if you can wait, it might save you some money so you don't have to purchase it twice.For me, I have used this software 2 years and have had no problem with it. It installed easily and never crashes or causes a problem with my computer. It is a tad slow on start up, but that seems to be common with non native apple programs, at least in my experience.I have several accounts that i use this for. I don't do complex things or download anything from the internet. I do have many, many scheduled transaction set, i have a budget and can see where I am with it, I can see what my net worth is at various times (now, 3 months ago, next month, end of quarter, next year, etc.)-this has been great for me to do debt management.The reconcile feature has worked seamlessly for me. It is easy to manuever around, edit, etc. I do not do reconciles from downloads.The version that comes out in 2010 is suppose to be more native mac looking/feeling. although this one doesn't bother me. It will probably have much more advanced features and be easier to incorporate downloaded information and downloaded reconciles.The financial software was one of the most difficult things for me in deciding to switch to mac. this is definately not as good as what is available for windows, however, it suites my needs great and I am very excited that I made the switch and didn't wait until a more improved financial software came out.If I did not have a financial software program right now, I would still purchase this even knowing that a new version is one the way. I don't know if I will upgrade to the new version or not as this certainly meets my needs."
28838,0,"Not a bad product, but not a great one. The interface is far less intuitive than Backup Exec's. When used with Dell tape drives, it is not unusual to have to power down the servers periodically to reload the tape drivers. On the other hand, Backup Exec requires a registry key change in order to work with Dell DLT drives, and they won't tell you that until you have talked to them long enough to advance to their &quot;advanced&quot; support, and paid them about $90. With Compaq servers, both brands seem to work well, with Backup Exec having the advantage of ease of use.To ArcServe's credit, it really does do competently what it is supposed to. I have used it several times for recoveries from complete failures with total data loss. You must be careful to understand precisely what is required for a restore, however, such as exact disk partition info, and site and organization name for the MS Exchange agent. There are also some peculiarities regarding supplying the admin user name and password. ArcServe will not require you to enter it, but will not restore data in some cases unless you do enter it in the appropriate places."

It has some great ideas for study and organization. I have found it interesting to listen to some of the lectures. It does not provide enough guidance and help in transfering audio files to an mp3 player.

91939,0,"Nancy Drew: Danger By Design (14)-Before I Begin...My review will be spilt up into sections and have a in-depth look at that topic. If you hate reading medium/long reviews or just don't have the patience I would not continue reading, but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you'll continue.-Gameplay & InterfaceThis series uses a simple and easy to use point-and-click interface. Your cursor will change to an appropriate arrow when you reach a hotspot to move to. Also when manipulating items or playing games we get a white hand (sometimes its blue) and then a hand with a toolbox icon to add stuff to our inventory. On the bottom panel of the screen we have a Menu button, Toolbox, Journal, Coin Purse and Help button. This interface is very easy so you should have no troubles waltzing around Paris and retrieving items. The Main Menu has been the same in this series for a long time. It includes basic options which are easy to navigate to. The Save/Load page is still just a little clunky. You can't delete your saved games and the prompts get annoying but not to much when you are Saving/Loading/Rewriting a game. A new way to tutorial has been introduced too. You finally see Nancy's Room and her desk. She has some memorabilia form past games, a how-to guidebook, a case file, and your plane ticket which asks for Senior or Junior Detective Levels. I enjoyed this disguised tutorial idea, but Her Interactive should sooner or later find out a way to fix that Save/Load page.****-PlotThe main plot was very interesting. Minette is falling behind on her Spring Fashion Collection because of threatening notes and phone calls. Not only is she falling behind but she is firing people left and right and throwing strange tantrums. And somehow all of this has put herself behind a mask. Nancy Drew is recruited as an intern by Amy Grunhild(Minette's financial advisor) to go undercover to find out what is really going on behind that mask wearing fashion designer. The problem is you don't really feel undercover at all because you don't get any Second Chance options (where you goof up) to show what you're really up to. This game would have better if this plot tied into this next sub-plot. While Nancy is uncovering clues on who is getting revenge on Minette, she learns about Noisette Tornarde. This woman was of the French Resistance and fell in love with a German solider, the French enemy at the time. She supposedly stole works of art from France and hid them during the war. She also was looked down on for fraternizing with the enemy on both sides of the war. Before she died she claimed she hid the works of art somewhere in her beloved city. The connection between Minette and Noisette? Noisette lived in the Moulin that Minette now calls her ""House Of Design"". I liked the sub-plot as well, but did we really need it to be in this game? I can understand that Her Interactive probably wanted you to learn a little background of France while you're ""there"", but it really doesn't connect with the fantastic Minette plot. Not only does it barely connect but I felt like I was finding out more about Noisette than getting farther in the mystery. This game did not have a climax. There was no ""break in the case"" or ""Oh this clue has got me two steps closer to who is threatening Minette!"" or ""I better watch my back because the culprit knows I'm on to something!"". Her Interactive used one great plot but totally ruined it by not including a climax and trying to merge another plot into it. It's still worth giving credit for it though because of how creative the plots were, interesting and mostly-fun the plots were.***-CharactersThere was a good variety of characters in this game. They were all interesting (especially Minette). There is Heather McKay, a young intern working for Minette. I can't tell if she is a teen or a college student but either way this is the second time Her Interactive has brought in a younger character (The first time was in ND 11 with Jane Penvellyn). She is confident and obviously good at her job because Minette hasn't fired her...yet. I wish we could talk to her more though (Unfortunately, this game doesn't have that much character interaction) and learn some more stuff about her. I only know that she is an intern who is hopeful to be a famous fashion designer who doesn't really have a motive to threaten Minette. Minette has a ex-boyfriend that is one of the characters, named Dieter von Schwesterkrank. He is a famous fashion photographer who may still have a nasty grudge on Minette. We do some tasks for him, find a secret passage in his office and talk to him every once in a while. But most of the time he is in his darkroom developing photos, probably more like hiding the truth from Nancy. Its hard to say if you'll enjoy this character, you really just talk about anything but himself. Nancy stays with one of Minette's fitting models, Jing-Jing Ling (That's an interesting name). She is an Australian who apparently was tricked into a contract that forces her to stay in Paris and be a fitting model. She can't wait to get out of Paris, is that because she is afraid she will be arrested for the threats to Minette? She may not be your favorite character because she lies to make her life seem more interesting, she's certainly not trustworthy, we may not know what she is lying about or not. Again, you won't learn that much about her. And there is Jean-Michel Traquenard, a gossip columnist. He is not interesting at all, and barely has no motive and very small role in the game. I could not see how he was a suspect. We finally have gotten to the best character of all in this game, Minette. The bad-tempered, eccentric, fashion designer. She is very interesting to watch and listen to. She is quite unpredictable and one of my favorite characters in this series. Could she be making the threats up herself just to gain publicity in the fashion world? These characters would have been a lot more fun if we actually got to know them better, enough said.***-Setting & GraphicsThe graphics in this game were wonderful. It was a feast for the eye! Her Interactive did a great job on these graphics I must say. The park was very realistic and the Moulin had a eerie sense. Jing-Jing Ling's apartment is full of light and charm, and the underwater (and underground) passages were very realistic. The music in this game was spectacular as always and made the setting more real. Although Her Interactive made me feel like I was in Paris, it would have been nice to see the Eiffel Tower (or visit it).*****-Puzzles/ActivitiesThe puzzles were not as exciting and connected as they could have been. You mainly run errands for Minette (although it is understandable because Nancy is an intern) and the other characters. There seemed to be a lot ""If you do this for me, I'll give you this"". Its okay to that once or three times but it gets annoying after a while. Errands and trading were the bulk of this game, it was disappointing. I loved searching through the underwater tunnels, translating French, and baking cookies. Her Interactive definitely needs to work on their puzzles. In fact, opening Minette's ""dodo"" box is a similar puzzle used in The Secret Of Shadow Ranch (10), and The Final Scene (5).***-EndingSome people seemed to complain on how this ending did not make sense and did not relate to the game at all. But I found the actual ending (meaning confronting the culprit) suspenseful and exciting. Her Interactive has never done an ending like this before (Maybe that's why people don't like it as much) and I thought it was quite entertaining. You don't catch the culprit, as you have in previous games, you have to fight the culprit. The person they choose as the culprit was a good choice, and I thought the motive to whatever they did was good. I think that the game ended rather abruptly though. One minute you find out an exciting secret about Noisette and the next your accidentally overhearing the culprit talk. I think there should have been suspense leading up to the ending instead, somewhat like the ending in Danger On Deception Island (9).****-OverallThis game was fun at points but was definitely not as good as some of the earlier games. It lacked suspense that the plot needed. The character interaction seems to be lessening and the puzzles are starting to get unoriginal and repetitive. Sure every game needs some repetitive chores to keep the game alive, but when almost all the puzzles are like that you start to get bored. I'll admit the game was enjoyable, give it a try because it's a decent game. I would recommend buying this on sale because it is worth about $17 not exactly $20. Good game, although lacking it's predecessors' qualities, but still a fun game.Add all these up and divide by 6...4 *'s (Gameplay & Interface)3 *'s (Plot)3 *'s (Characters)5 *'s (Setting & Graphics)3 *'s (Puzzles)4 *'s (Ending)= 22 Stars Divide By 6 (Categories) = About 3 Stars-Recommended Nancy Drew GamesDanger On Deception IslandThe Curse Of Blackmoor ManorLast Train To Blue Moon Canyon"

83500,1,"Photoshop Elements was specifically designed to help you create high-quality web graphics. Although its environment looks a lot like Photoshop and it has many of Photoshop's same powerful features, Elements is easier to learn and use. Before Elements, I used PaintShop Pro v. 7 and was very satisfied with it. However, Photoshop Elements has become my program of choice. Most of Adobe's products are well worth the investment...this one is no exception. If you're designing any graphics for use on the web, you'll be pleased with this program."

It comes with lots of features, including out-of-the-box, easy to install and use, Apache, Perl, PHP and MySQL, all configured correctly, and working on multiple platforms.

3794,1,"This is such a great product I hardly know where to begin. At last I have a program to burn music dvds and clean up my library. I'm holding off downloading mp3 files until I see how much music I have on other media. My parents gave me their lps so I'm transferring them onto dvds. Sometimes the lps are scratched so I may replacde those songs with mp3 versions. However most of the lp music has been recorded onto the dvds and the quality is astounding. I'm grateful that Roxio has added id tags so that you don't have to waste time putting all the info. The id info lets you make menus in a variety of ways. This has saved me several hours of time.Since I've been using this program for several weeks without trouble, I also would recommend this product to anyone. How can anyone say that it's no good. I found just the opposite, it is great and works with almost no glitches."

5905,0,"People use tax software so that they can save money as well as prepare their taxes very easily without having deep knowledge of tax laws.1. Taxcut is way too complicated for average user. Almost all its screens are written as they were copied from IRS publications.2. It is very buggy program. It crashes when updating as well as importing w-2 or previous year's tax returns.3. Technical support/ Customer service spends 15 minutes asking for all your name, address, phone information and they just don't know anything about how to fix problems. If online FAQ solves your problem then you are lucky.4. Comapred to Turbotax, Taxcut sometimes forces you to enter information directly on forms.5. I had lots of problems when printing forms for Taxcut state, all my forms were wrong and out of print margin.6. I bought taxcut as well as Turbotax for comparison. I am a computer engineer and with increasing piracy and invalid use of intellectual property, don't get surprised if Taxcut introduces the same technique of product activation next year. This is not unusual. We should not forget the clear ease and performance of Turbotax that Taxcut can't even get closer. What H &amp; R block really need is good programmers who can transform tax forms and calculations into user friendly environment.I am sticking with Turbotax and everybody who is a regular Turbotax user who changed their minds this year should also do the same. Believe me, by 4/15/2003 Turbotax sales will be higher that Taxcut. That's my word."
71145,0,"Well, what can you say... live and learn I suppose. Bottom-line, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is a big disappointment for me.I recently purchases Elements 3.0 and read the upgrade benefits in Elements 4.0 on the Adobe website. I thought, great 16-bit image support, facial color restoration, improved this improved that.At the end of the day, I uninstalled Elements 4.0 and went back to 3.0Why? I take a lot of photos and keep them in the highest resolution format I can. I generally use TIFF format. I like to convert them into JPG format for distribution on CD/DVD or on the web.In Photoshop Elements 3.0 there was a file browser and I could easily select 2 or more photos and edit them or convert them. This file browser is gone in 4.0 and while it was poorly designed in 3.0 it worked once you figured out its annoyances.But the 4.0 product in practice doesn't seem to handle 16-bit files any differently than the 3.0 version. What's more, it tends to blow up on my system when converting to JPG. In fact some of the very same files I converted with 3.0 to JPG are causing 4.0 to blow up.I would speculate that PhotoShop Elements 4.0, which is only available under Windows for now, will be thoroughly tested by the time the Mac OS X version comes out later this year. Too bad Windows users have to be the beta testers and funding providers for Adobe's PhotoShop Elements 4.0If you already own PhotoShop Elements 2.0 or 3.0 don't bother with this upgrade. If you own nether, I would recommend Microsoft Digital Image 2006 Suite. It is easier to use and ironically seems to work better."
25917,2,"I bought this to try and rescue a non-booting Win2k machine. Window's CHKDSK wasn't fixing the problem, so I thought I'd buy Norton's in the hopes that it would keep me from having to reformat and reinstall Windows. Even though Win2k is clearly marked as supported on the box, few of Disk Doctor's features actually work with Win2k's NTFS disk formatting. I ended up having to reinstall Windows and recovering what data I could manually.Ghost seemed like it would be really useful, but Ghost's &quot;burn image directly to CDRWs&quot; option didn't work with either of the CDRW drives that I tried (TEAC CDW28E or HP 8210e).Speed disk seems to work fine, which is about the only good thing that I have to say about SystemWorks so far. To be fair, Win98 seems much more fully supported, but that doesn't help my Win2k laptop! (And who buys Win98 anymore??)Summary: avoid for Win2000, maybe OK for Win98."
83670,1,"I bought this product after looking at Topo! and Microsoft Streets which I think it is signifcantly better than. I use it specifically for creating route maps with directions for long distance road cycling as I train people for charity rides. There are some limitations in the data sets, I found a few missing bike paths and such like, but the fact that you can draw these on as routable paths is great. You can't do this with Microsoft. I also love the fact that you get profiles and elevations etc.Better printing options would be nice, but for road cycling - this is a great product."

For what the regular user would use this program for, it is just as the others have said -- it works just fine. And at this price...yeah, I'd choose this over Microsoft any day.However, I recently started doing our church's newsletter in it and have had a heck of a time getting it to work. In fact, last night, rather than working on the newsletter, I spent my time re-installing the program because every time I try to insert a graphic, it freezes up on me. Once I reinstalled, it no longer froze, but I couldn't move the graphic around or do anything I wanted to with it.I'm not going to uninstall this program. But I am going to look for another program to use in creating the newsletter."
11789,1,"Although I was somewhat apprehensive about purchasing this product because of the negative reviews, I spent the dough and waited anxiously for the UPS man to show up.A couple of days later my package arrived via the turd-brown truck and was deposited into my eager clutches.I sprinted up the rickety staircase of our 1896 Victorian, only pausing long enough to request a large rum and coke from my wife, then gleefully tore into my new software.After the simple one-step download, I started up the program and was presented with the daunting task of doing something with the blank page staring back at me.Not being the type to read all the manuals and necessary information before diving into a project, I glanced at the quick-start information and immediately went to work.The controls were extremely intuitive and I easily created the foundation. Upon this I laid the second floor and roof in minutes.Because of my home's unique Victorian porches, rails, and stacked bay windows, I did have to find specific information in the manual to address those details. All answers were simple to find thanks to the software's search menu. Simply type your topic and answers are sorted by relevance.The paper manual is also a great reference and has an index to find specific answers. I believe the entire manual is contained in the ""help"" search, but I don't actually know. I do know that every difficulty I encountered was easily solved by using the search bar.My original plan was to build a practice model to get comfortable with the software, then create another file with specific dimensions. This became unnecessary as the day progressed because it is so simple to input dimensions and insert walls, windows, doors, etc.Once the shell of my house was made, I grabbed my tape measure, went outside, and measured the dimensions of the foundation, doors, windows, etc.Back inside on Punch I simply lengthened walls, raised ceilings, stretched windows, and entered exact dimensions. With that, my Punch house was an exact duplicate of my home.The process continued with measuring interior spaces and dropping walls into place.The 2 story house with exact interior and exterior dimensions took about 5 hours to complete. This includes learning how to use the software on a basic level, manually measuring every surface in the house, consuming multiple and increasingly potent rum beverages and repeatedly complaining to my wife that my stomach was empty and needed solid nourishment. Had I been sober at the time the process may have been more expedient. There was quite a bit of unnecessary stalling because I simply was in no condition to go outside and measure.Once the exact shell was created, the program really came to life.There are huge menus of colors, textures, materials, fixtures, appliances, etc, that are infinitely customizable.In fact, once the shell was made, my wife shambled over with a large glass of wine, muttered something incoherent, and bumped me out of my chair. With a few simple instructions:A) ""these are your materials and color menus""B) ""drag and drop what you want where you want it""she quickly and expertly painted the rooms using Sherman Williams actual paint library. The colors are identified by name and product number so you can go to the Sherman Williams and request ""UPS turd-brown 60097"" *not an actual SW color* and be in and out of the store in minutes, not weeks. It makes the agonizing chore of choosing colors simple and relatively painless.Not only that, it's great fun to see all the possibilities without all the back-breaking, mind-numbing manual labor involved in actually painting a room only to hate it and repaint it.Other features such as the landscape design are worth the cost of the program on their own. I completely changed my landscape plans and gardenhouse placement once I saw them in 3-D. That alone saved me thousands of dollars.I highly recommend this product if you are planning a remodel. The materials choices are phenomenal, the ability to instantly change, tweak, and customize designs is simple and extremely useful in the planning process.Buy it. Ignore the bad reviews. If I can learn this program while drunk, you can surely do it."

Thereafter, I couldn't stay connected long enough to complete the download. Don't get caught in this &quot;Catch 22&quot; like I did!"

73413,0,"In the first lecture of his intensive course in Russian at Harvard, Professor Horace G. Lunt used to compare different methods of language learning. His comment on the ""learn a language as a child does"" was, ""Do you really want to spend five years of your life learning to speak like a five-year old child?"" His point was that an adult has several advantages in a language learning over a child. The two most important of these advantages are: (i) the adult already knows one language, and can compare the working of the second language with that and thus master the second easier; (ii) the adult can grasp grammatical concepts (which explain the structure of the language) and thus learn the structure of a language and how to manipulate it without having to infer this from an endless repetition of instances-- the adult can learn more efficiently.These observations apply to the Rosetta Stone series. They are very good for teaching (relatively painlessly) basic vocabulary and the elementary working of a language. They don't go much beyond that. If you want to teach yourself how to manipulate a language and to produce responses automatically, the Foreign Service Institute courses, although a bit tedious, are far superior."
26905,1,"I've tried a dozen or so burning packages, including Roxio (they scare me), Intervideo, Pinnacle (they also scare me), DVD Express, and several others. Nero is the only one that I can actually use, and doesn't make we want to scream from excrutiating pain.Nope, its not perfect, but boy it sure is the best in class. I can sit down, and make a DVD or CD without spending hours trying to figure out what the software designers were thinking. With Roxio or Pinnacle, I have NO idea how to get a DVD done. And those 2 companies spend more time trying to sell me stuff than helping me use their products.Yup, Nero, after many years of working on their software, has finally gotten to be best in class. Its the only one that you can install, get to work, and use almost immediately.I also find it funny how almost ALL of the bad reviews here are by folks who have trouble with the Free or Demo versions. While I too, find problematic demo software frustrating, Nero probably does a better job than most of giving people a pretty good idea of their software with free product. But they do have a right to limit functionality of demo software, as they are trying to earn a living from the product.But hey, I'm just one guy. All I know is that all the other titles I've mentioned just plain stink at being usable. Lots of neat features that I simply cannot use. With Nero, the features are their, and the basic product just works."

There are 6 CatDog games, they can choose the level of difficulty from 1 to 10.Most of the playing involves the arrow keys on the keyboard, which is helping them out to be able to look at the monitor without looking at the keys they need to use. Sounds effects are excellent.This game does take some skill and kids will quickly pick up more on that after playing this game.You can also save a game in the beginning, midddle, or end."
45724,0,This is my 2nd attempt at installing a linux installation previously I tried SUSE 8.2 Pro and well it drove me nuts I just couldnt get it integrated into a windows network everything i wanted to do was incredibly difficult.I would rank my abilty slightly higher than the average windows user. Most windows problems i can solve but I am very inexperienced with linux.For my installation I chose to do so via ftp download. I downloaded the bootcd.iso from suse. This is not an easy way to install suse. I had to use an 8.2 disk to format my hard drive.Suse could make life a lot easier by including more on the boot cd image (about 20 meg).I had to find a compatible network card driver (google) once that was done i had to setup a server to download from having your own lan makes life so much easier as you can have a 2nd machine resolving issues. ping is handy to find the x.x.x.x address of an ftp server with broadband its just a question of waiting for the download.I setup with a graphical desktop but without office.Most people will want to integrate suse into a windows network and this is where a major improvement has taken place on the desktop is local network its just like network nieghborhood in windows.The Samba client will find your windows workgroup effortlessly To make suse visable to windows machines you need samba server select it through yast and it will download and install add your network name and its visable to your windows machines.Realvnc is a free client and server which you can install on almost any operating system with the server running on your windows or mac ect pc. The server exports your desktop to any client machine and gives full remote access.support for this is built into suse9.0 you can connect with system/remoteaccess/desktopsharing put the ip address of your windows machine and give it the password and there is your windows desktop sat in a window on your linux box with everything on it ready to run :)you can also configure do the reverse and put the suse desktop on your windows machine.suse9.0 also has online update which you can use to update the packages on your system and install more packages when needed practically pain free.If you have a broadband connection then living with suse9.0 is not the nightmare it used to be compared with 8.2.This pc dual boots suse9.0 and windows Me but it is likely to run suse more than windows. I wouldnt recommend doing the install by ftp download though it is a lot easier and quicker with a cd installation set.If you are a reasonably experienced computer user then this distribution will allow you to gently ease yourself into the linux community. Rename konquerer internet explorer and i thinkeven a novice could start using suse9.0 with little additional help. with its install on demand features everything is there when you need it.It still has the problem that too much gets installed by defaultI would prefer a system stripped down to what i use.all in all a very good effort this is a linux i can use.I do network support for an internet cafe and I would be tempted to run it on some of the pc's there however I need to have the connectivity with the many messenger clients out there I also find users uncomfortable with staroffice and gimp mostly due to the &quot;unusual&quot; file dialogues if these issues can be addressed then I could use suse within the cafe.

81218,1,"I just started using this. I did some drafting eons ago and it was tedious work. I have used Google's sketch up and Design Workshop Lite. It is much easier to learn the basics than either one of those programs and much less frustrating. It does seem to have very limited extensions, but I have only used for about 10 hours. There probably is much more that is not initially obvious."

58508,0,"When it comes to setting up a more complex route, Google Maps beats this hands down, but if you want that info in your Garmin GPS you don't have much choice than to use this. Only shows the total distance for a route, not to the different waypoints you might have programmed. Adding a waypoint requires you to find it first, save it, and then add it to a route. And if you interupt a route along the way, when you resume it your GPS will try to get you back to the original starting point, and then it will skip all the remaining waypoints in your route, only showing the final destination.In a nutshell, the user interface needs a serious overhaul.Wish it was Mac compatible. Works OK on a PC, but the transfers of data can take up to 20 minutes (when routes that touch 7 states are in the system), and if you try to skip the maps part thinking they're already in the device you will be sorely disappointed."

65261,1,I've been using .MAC for 4 years. Apple sells it for $99. Amazon is the best deal in town. All you get is a box with a registration key.The IMAP mail account is worth it for me. Everything else is a bonus.
203,1,"I find it odd that some other reviewers complained about the format. Yes, the first CD teaches you vocabulary and the second CD is in Italian, but this is exactly how you would learn a language in any quality language class. You can't expect to learn a language by someone holding your hand through the whole process. It may be a little challenging, but the end result is the ability to ask someone basic questions in Italian and listen to the response without a blank stare on your face.I bought these CDs to learn a little Italian before a trip to Italy, and I found the vocabulary to be very relevant to prepare for an Italy trip. Sure, this may not be as effective as Rosetta Stone, but it is also a much better value."
55678,0,"I anxiously awaited my copy of Route 66 for MAC. As a recent convert from Windows XP, I have been spoiled by Microsoft Streets and Trips maping software. I was at first very pleased with this program as it has very complete and accurate streets and directions for my area, (a suburb of Los Angeles). It is not completely intuitive and the user instructions are somewhat difficult to follow. It does not come with any manual or written directions and the website has scant information. The FAQ section is worthless. However with a little patience one can use it without too many problems by trial and error if you have ever used Microsoft Streets and Trips, it is very similar.However, now for the down sides. It will not print directions or strip maps. I have a new copy of Panther, (not an upgrade) on a new G5 with top end everything. I have tried it on laserjet and ink jet printers with the same results. Every time I hit the print command, the program either freezes and must be forced to quit or it will quit unexpectedly and all your directions are lost so you must then again open the program and find all the streets and so on over and over. It will Print the map using the current view command but you must manually write all the directions.I have tried to contact the company for support but they do not list a phone number and the only way to contact them is by email. I have written them several times over the last two weeks and all I get is an automatic response saying the email was received by Route 66 and channeled to the proper section. The have not responded and they have not apparantly fixed the bugs.There are a few other more minor problems, for expample, when you put in all the destinations you want to map out it will sometimes pick a less desireable or illogical route than you might if you analyse the streets for density and traffic controls. However it will get you there and you an alter the route without too much difficulty.Overall I am mixed on the program. For the moment, there is nothing to compare to Microsoft Streets and Trips other than this for MAC and it has potential, but I need to print out routes quickly and easily without all the problems I am now experiencing. I would say wait to see if they work out the bugs and then you will have a great alternative to the PC programs available."
64646,1,"Trying to find things for my kids to do is always a challenge. That's why when Thomas the Tank Engine and Frainds have a software package like this one I had to get a copy.With 4 engines using 3 locations and 5 possible tracks, giving you 60 different layouts there is always soemthing different. I think if they release another version they should add more engines like Henry, Gordon, Toby and Duck.You'll find fun right around every turn including having George rip up the track and you have to replace it. You can help Cranky the Crane move boulders off the track and help the engines back on the track when they fall off.Also there is haybales, crates and oil drums you can spill to only have to clean up after. The only thing I didn't see is Thumper, but I sure he'll show up at some time. Ther are 2 levels a junior and senior engineer, giving you different things to do at each location.Overall this is a great experience for the kids to look and learn as well as build computer and mouse skills."

125,1,"I won't go into the technical detail of this product as you can find reviews all over the net. But as a user of Premiere Pro 6 I was looking for something more updated to handle HD content even better and has tight integration with sound and effects providing software. I narrowed the search down to Premiere Pro CS3 and Sony's Vegas Pro 8.Both are great products and would serve a pro/pro-am filmmaker or home video tinkerer equally well. I decided on the Premiere Pro CS3 product basically due to the tight integration with other Adobe products such as After Effects CS3, Photoshop CS3 Extended, SoundBooth CS3 etc. Sony knits well with Cinescore and I really like Cinescore but the various Adobe software suites really can provide you with a complete production studio.I liked Premiere Pro CS3 so much that I invested in the CS3 Master Collection, a bit pricey (as are all of Adobe products for some reason) but in my opinion and for the film projects that I am working on (semi-pro), the investment is well worth it. If you have some technical abilities, a desire to learn the software packages and are willing to hone your craft (artistic as well as technical) you can be a 1 person professional production studio. Some of the end results that I have produced with the CS3 suites and a pro-sumer HDV camera are indistinguishable from a production that has spent hundreds of thousands or more on post-production, including some eye popping special effects.I give it 5 stars because Premiere Pro CS3 is at the top of the game. The only real cons I have found so far are A) the price and B) it is a huge memory user. The minimum requirements say you need at least 1 GB of memory and they mean it. Optimally, you should have more than that for video production of this caliber. I'd say at least 3 GB is prime. 4 or more is gravy."
17460,1,I was very skeptical of buying Express edition due to the big price difference between Express edition and other Spyder editions.

9647,0,"The reason I bought the Reunion desktop software was because the company is selling an add-on application that allows you to carry your family tree information on the iPhone and iTouch. This is a wonderful feature that enhances my ability to do genealogy research without hauling my laptop everywhere. The app gives you the ability to synch data with the desktop app. I bought that app for an additional $16 and used it for a couple of weeks. It worked well until I updated my iTouch with the new OS 3.0. Then it stopped working. When looking at the Reunion software support site, they are well aware of the problem and indicated they are waiting for Apple to approve their new version of the app. But I see no reason, considering the extra charge for this app for them not to have had this fixed prior to the OS release. I am still waiting and can't use Reunion on my iTouch. This wouldn't have been as painful had this company included the app as part of the desktop software or offered a discount to purchase it when you purchased Reunion. The iTouch app won't work without the desktop app and that is the sole reason I bought the desktop app. So at the moment my purchase of this software was wasted. The desktop app also has it's limitations on transferring a GEDCOM file. I had to reformat most of my notes as they didn't transfer properly. It is too bad images can't be transferred with the GEDCOM, but I imagine this is a limitation of the GEDCOM format and not Reunion. At any rate, I am giving Reunion a much lower rating than I would like to, because they are so darn greedy to charge additional for an app that they knew would not work with the Apple OS 3.0 and yet didn't warn customers. They are greedy because they should have included the iPhone/iTouch app with the desktop package and for not having the overpriced app ready for Apple's OS upgrade which was announced last year. Many other software companies were in the same predicament, but were able to update their apps in a punctual fashion so that their users weren't inconvenienced. But this software company apparently waited too long to update their software and now their customers are holding the bag. Also, why doesn't Amazon offer a software download option to purchase this software - the software manufacturer offers this on their website if you want to buy it directly from them."

12620,1,"Microsoft has hit a home-run with this operating system. I have installed it on 7 different systems--HP, Dell, and custom-built units--ranging from a 5-year old Pentium II 266MHz with 224 MB RAM to P4 1.6 GHz with 512MB RAM. I have four more lined up for installation. All the XP systems are stable and vastly improved over NT, '98 or ME. The users are unanimously happy. And, no, I don't work for Microsoft!Several things should be done before you decide to upgrade to Windows XP.1. Run the diagnostic that you can download from Microsoft (it is also on the XP CD) and determine which of your hardware and software might not be compatible. Make sure that you have at least a Pentium II 233MHz with 256MB RAM. You can get by with 192MB, but I would not go lower. RAM is cheap... 2. Go to the websites of the manufacturers of your peripherals and see whether they have new Windows XP drivers, or whether XP contains native driver support. Download the new ones if they have them and put them on a CD-RW for later use. Check the websites of your favorite software and see whether it is compatible or whether there are XP-related patches.3. Back up your data. If you use Outlook Express for e-mail, save your entire Outlook Express directory. Export your address book to a CSV text file. Export your Favorites from Internet Explorer. Save all your directories with your own data files. Use a CD-RW to do this if you have one. The export functions are under File/Export in most applications.4. Always do a clean install so you can completely get rid of all the corruption in your current setup. This means booting from the Windows XP CDROM. To do that you will probably have to enter the BIOS/Setup and change your boot sequence to put the CD-ROM drive first.5. Once you have booted to the XP CD-ROM, follow the instructions to delete your existing partition(s), create a new partition, and install XP on the new NTFS partition. I recommend a single NTFS partition for the entire hard drive.5. When installation is complete, go to Start/Windows Update, and go online and get the latest Windows XP updates, including all current security patches for Internet Explorer.6. If your motherboard has on-board sound chips, XP might not support the sound. You might have to disable the on-board sound (in the BIOS) and install a sound card. You can probably use an ISA or PCI SoundBlaster card from an old computer if your have one. Otherwise, you can buy a SoundBlaster Live Value PCI (OEM) card on-line at several places ...7. Once you have completed the XP installation, using that CD-RW you created in step 2, just use the import functions in Outlook Express (Import Other Address Book, and Import Messages from an Outlook Express Store) and Internet Explorer to import them into the new setup. The Import wizards are in each application at File/Import. Use the Help button if you have questions...Update: July 5, 2002I have done several more installations since my original review, and my overall evaluation has not changed. This is a terrific operating system. Virtually all the problems that I read about here are because people did not do their preliminary steps and prepare for the upgrade. Here are a few more guidelines that will help with your installation:1. If you have a laptop that will connect to a corporate LAN, don't use XP Home Edition, use XP Professional.2. If you have a home Peer-to-Peer network with extensive file security/privacy requirements, use XP Professional.3. ALWAYS check the website of your PC manufacturer or motherboard manufacturer, as appicable, to see if there is an updated BIOS available BEFORE you install XP. If there is one, carefully follow the instructions to flash/update your BIOS. Then, go to step 1 in my original review and follow those steps."
60816,0,"The software package does not have all the bells and whistles that I would like, but I get hours of enjoyment reading old articles. Despite what you have read in other reviews, the articles are perfectly readable when viewed in a magnification mode. Some of you reviewers better see an optometrist. I found the browser to be very straightforward and easy to use. It has the feel of actually flipping through the magazine, but you don't get the benefits of viewing an electronic document because the pages (text included) are jpeg files. No cut and paste here. You can however search for articles by subject and flip through magazines by page, article, year, or decade. My primary complaint is all of those CDs--a DVD collection would be more convenient. 32 CDs occupy a lot less space than 112 years worth of magazines though. Hopefully National Geographic can work out its legal problems with this software package so they can release an update that addresses some of the complaints you have read about here. Right now it's the only game in town."

63086,1,"I usually wait awhile or do not upgrade my OS, but because it was my birthday, I thought to spend the money and get this done. I missed not upgrading to OS 9 or X, then Panther, and regretted sorely missing all the cool new features and spot upgrades, then. Tiger is well worth the money, and Amazon offers the best deal.I am unable to use many features, like iSight and others, but I am wowed by Dashboard (I downloaded a widget already), the increase to 16X on my CD burning, the faster start up time, and improved performance on some of my Jaguar apps. I had problems with my Adobe PhotoShop Elements 3.0 on 10.2.8, but that all has cleared up. That is one great photo editing program, now!I tested all my other apps, and even the Classic ones work fine. The biggest problem I have now is that while installing Tiger, a message flashed up to reinstall my Norton SW 2.0, especially the antivirus (I have 8.0.1). Otherwise installation went fine. I uninstalled both versions (9 and X) of SystemWorks 2.0, and had problems trying to reinstall. I see Symantec is working on an update for NAV 9, so I guess I'll have to upgrade to that. Also, Dantz warns not to use Retrospect 5 or 6 on Tiger. I run Retrospect Express 5 for my 200 GB External FW hard drive, so I have to wait for the update (announced to be a week or so).My printer works better, my ZIP drive works better, but my slide scanner works about the same, though. I can load my digital photos, as usual, or faster, with my card reader and my CF cards. The colors of my photos displayed all look a bit better, too. My QT movies seem to be improved, too.Reading MacFixIt, I see there are many problems to upgrades, but I think Apple really worked out the bugs, this time, and as soon as I can update my other two critical apps, I'll be doing pretty well. The better functionality of my other Jaguar apps, especially PSE 3.0, is well worth my money there! I expect more pleasant surprises as I delve in deeper to using Tiger, and hey, you only live once. I give my strongest urging and approval to upgrade to Tiger, but maybe you should wait a bit till Symantec and Dantz, say, can offer updates."

6353,1,"It was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade Word and Excel, and to get Virtual PC (for Access) as well. I used them a lot on my PC a few years ago, and when I first switched to Mac, couldn't find software that did what they did. I had no trouble installing the upgrade on my iMac G5, nor did I have trouble installing Virtual PC. The only thing that WAS disappointing was that I couldn't find out whether accessing the Internet from Virtual PC would open me up to PC-type viruses, or if Mac's Unix system would protect me there, too. I continue to be disappointed that the Mac version of this software is not as rich as the PC version. But the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do."

60974,2,"Stuffit Deluxe 8.0 (as well as 7.5) sounds good by its feature list, but is a very bad implementation of the compression/decompression formats. It supports almost any compression type you can imagine, as well as adding its own compression format, however the support is very buggy.The main problems with this are speed and errors. First, this product is at least 10 times slower than the command-line based extraction tools, and at least 5 times slower than any other graphical archiving tool I've used.Second, there are many errors in this product. For example, I've had several zip files and rar files fail to decompress. The product reports an error about the file format being wrong, or it causes an error that the filename is too long. This is very bad, and it is not the file that is wrong, it is Stuffit. If you use any other archiving tool, the file decompresses fine (and much faster!).The only reason I give this 2 stars is because it does support a wide variety of formats. However, I'd highly recommend any other products instead of this one. You can even find free archive software for most of these formats."

84713,0,"As a fan of the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang since childhood, I immediately jumped at this game when I saw commercials for it in the late 90s. Of corse, not being too picky at that age, the last thing I noticed was that, aside from actually seeing the title character for about five minutes at the beginning of them game, it had absolutely nothing to do with the film of it's origin. Despite this huge flaw/scheme to get more fans of Chitty to give MGM more money, the game is quite fun. The characters are charming and their quirky personalities make the learning experiences in this game quite memorable. Plus, there's occasionally a tidbit of useful information here and there. Did you know ""[...]"" came from Thomas Crapper, inventor of the toilet? I didn't until I played this game.In conclusion:For fans of movie: BADFor kids who don't care either way and just wanna play a fun computer game: A-OK!"

28588,0,"My grandparents bought this game to for me, my brothers and sisters,and my cousins. At first it was great! It was challenging. I got to leap across roofs, break codes, desguise myself, and do lots of other things. There were quite a few cool gadgets like a lipstick recorder, robot spy puppy (my favorite) and a perfume tracker. You have to find out who stole barbie's friend's fashion clothes. There are dozens of different outfits that you can choose from at different times. First you can do training so you know how to do spy moves, but you don't have to. It's easy to use. After I completed the mission once though, it wasn't as great. I don't play it much any more. If I owned it though, I don't think I would play it at all! I think this should be for ages seven and up, because of the hardness of the puzzles. Hope this review is helpful!"
88141,1,"I've been using this program for years to keep track of birthdays, anniversaries, etc. I bought a couple of more recent versions, but to my dismay, Broderbund took out some of the functionality that the Softkey versions had. Specifically, they took out the capability to have graphics be in ""small"" or ""Sizable"" format. This allowed the program to shrink the graphics in day cells to accommodate the text for that event. In the Broderbund versions, the only choices available are light background or full cell, which for my purposes, is unusable. I've tried versions 7 & 10, but neither of these had this function, so I keep a computer with Windows 98, just so I can still use the older version 4 program. I hope Broderbund fixes this eventually, but they don't seem too concerned with Customer Satisfaction."
73681,1,"I purchased this game after playing a 'sample' given on my new Gateway computer. As of today I've been unable to get past level 10, but I'm determined!!! It's very fun to play. I have it installed on my laptop, which has a touchpad mouse (it may be more difficult to play on a computer with a regular mouse because you have to click alot and make Flo run from different locations...) Once I've mastered this game, I'm going to move on to the next edition!!"
21877,1,"Reading over the other reviews was surprising for me because there are so many bad ones. I've installed the program on NT4, Win2KPro, and Win98. I've probably spent at least 50 hours actively using it and it never once crashed in either Win2KPro or Win98. The 3D engine crashes my NT4 box every time, but if you stay away from the 3D it works fine. It will depend upon your video driver more than anything else.The other problems people experienced seemed to have more to do with their expectations than the product itself. I sat down with a friend who has an architecture degree (but isn't yet a licensed architect) and lots of AutoCAD experience. We tried to develop a design in AutoCAD and, of course, made lots of progress, but I couldn't have done it myself. Even with him at the helm, the going was very slow. I bought this product to try to speed the process up and put it in my own control and it performed admirably.I think it would be very hard to design a highly detailed home with it, and there's no way it will replace an architect if you actually need the level of design an architect can provide. However, if you're designing a relatively simple home and you mostly want to work on floorplans, windows, and furniture placement, it's just the ticket. Very easy to use, maybe a little clunky here and there, but certainly functional. The 3D views are useful but nowhere near video game speed and quality.It's not going to be very useful if you're doing something more sophisticated. It's not very useful for interior design in terms of colors and textures. The roof capabilities are very limited. But none of this was very important to me. It does the other things very well."

39017,0,"This program would be a good supplement to a high school chemistry class. The practice tests would provide a helpful review. But as a stand-alone tutor, this program is inadequate.I wanted something to help me learn chemistry by self-study. With a name like ChemTutor, I was hoping it would teach me chemistry in a coherent, systematic way like a textbook or a class would do. But the so-called tutorial mode is just a bunch of random questions, like a practice test. To learn a subject it takes more than just answering isolated, individual questions, but that is all this software provides. It should be called ChemReview instead of ChemTutor. If you are looking for a standalone program to teach you chemistry by self-study, this is not it.Also, from a graphical design point of view, the whole thing looks like it was created in the 1980s. There is only over-sized text and basic diagrams. There are no animations, photos, or multimedia of any kind.I was disappointed with ChemTutor Excalibur."
69770,1,"The Nancy Drew PC Mystery Games are fun for anyone to play! Great 3D graphics, background music and sound effects! You are the detective. It's fun to interact with the cast of characters, figure out the fun,challenging puzzles & games, gather clues, and narrow down your list of suspects. ""Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake"" is one of the more interactive ones. I also really enjoyed: ""Secret of the Scarlet Hand"", ""Message in Haunted Mansion"" and ""Danger on Deception Island"". I first played on the Junior level, but now I play at the Senior Detective level. You can save your game along the way. ...I think younger children might need assitance here & there. Really, all of the N.D. games are great fun!"

1926,1,"To easy (and slow) for 5 year olds, but perfect for 2.5 to 4 year olds. This game would also work for kids who are first learning how to use the computer. At 3 they love the fact that Steve talks alot, and that the game moves at a much slower pace. The wonderful thing about the game is the complexity of the story, and how many levels there are. I think of all the games that my two boys have played this one still sits near the top."
68266,1,"As an attorney and educator, I have reviewed and tested many different risk management methods to manage the risk of becoming a victim of identity theft.I teach accredited courses for educational requirements of many professionals, including attorneys, CPAs, financial planners, insurance agents, and real estate licensees, among others.In my work, I have found that the CasePlanner program, from Global Fraud Solutions, is the only comprehensive tool for the responsible consumer to use for pro-active personal and professional identity theft risk management and case resolution.Most of my audiences begin with no idea of what actions to take to avoid becoming a victim of identity theft, or worse, what to do in the event of an actual identity theft incident -- either for themselves or their clients.With CasePlanner, the menu-driven and wizard-style assistance leads the user through the otherwise complicated and time-consuming tasks of avoiding and/or recovering from identity theft.For security, CasePlanner is passworded and the data input is encrypted -- further protecting against the predations of identity thieves.Working with this excellent program, professionals and consumers can become part of the fight against this fast-growing crime, instead of being the next target.It's easy for me to see why such prestigious organizations as the Identity Theft Resource Center, Institute of Consumer Financial Education, Utah State Bar, National Notary Association, and new ones nearly every day, are using, endorsing, or otherwise offering as a member benefit access to the CasePlanner program.I am very pleased to see that through Amazon this important tool in the battle against identity theft is now being made available to all."

85100,1,Ok so I'm 11 1/2. i was 11 when i got this. I actually have petz 5 where you can have both catz and dogz together. anyway it's a great game but you have to be loyal and careful. you have to make sure you play every day or every other day to feed your petz and play games with them. You have to be careful blc... well here's my story. I got petz without reading any reviewz. 1st mistake. You are allowed to breed puppies and i would do this once every 2 months b/c 2 months is a year for petz. the puppiez are soo cute. only problem is that it doesn't state is that your petz don't die. now it's sad for petz to die but it is very sad when you have 16-18 petz and can't take care of them. Lastly when they run-away b/c they were neglected it says to check the board in the adoption center. well you can just forget about the board cause your petz are never coming back and the board never has anything on it. so don't breed alot. the games are fun for a bit but it's hard to get your petz where you want them to go. you don't win coins or anything. I wrote this b'c i thought all you kids out there should know about this game before you get it. if your a mom or dad reading this b/c your kid wants it get your kid here to see this review. another option is sims 2 petz which i can't have until i'm like 16 but it seems good. though i gotta check the REVIEWZ!

29528,0,"I have one of these 208 cd binders, and have found it to be about adequate. I haven't experienced any problem of breakage with mine - in fact, the plastic pins seem quite resistant to all attempts to dislodge them. However, the general construction seems flimsy: the outer zip case is a separate piece from the actual sleeve & binder, which is thin vinyl that slips into the 'jacket'. Also, there is no handle, which I find to be a plus on other binders I own. I find the sleeves to be very tight for 8 cds, and even a bit snug for just 4 cds with 4 liner notes. Plus the design has an extra flap of plastic at the top that I think tends to scratch the back of the disc as it is pulled out or pushed in.My biggest complaint, though, is that it just doesn't work for my collection. The 3 ring constructed binders work so much better for me - my collection is growing fast and I'm very organized, so the fixed order pages mean lots of shuffling backwards as new things are added. I finally decided to use this one just for software, because I don't acquire as much of that or need it in any kind of order. In short, I use it for something because I have it, but I wouldn't buy it again."

27589,1,"Okay, I'll admit it. I'm old enough to be Nancy Drew's grandmother, but I still liked this game. It was challenging enough (on ""senior"" detective level) to keep an experienced gamester like me satisfied, and I enjoyed the lack of gore and foul language which seems to be mandatory for most games today.The graphics were very good, and the plot was interesting (you can read all the stuff about Marie Antoinette if you want a history lesson, or skip it and go for the mystery). It was a bit ""confining"" since almost all the action takes place in the one castle, but at least you get to go outdoors a couple of times.All in all, a nice game to spend a few hours on -- good enough for me to get others in the series."
83430,1,"I needed an inexpensive spreadsheet and after I checking out the competition, was pleased to find this one. It installed with no problems, however the spreadsheet had no ""calculator"" feature like I had been used to.

Now I find this spreadsheet is easier to use than one with a claculator."
62229,1,"Of all the games we've bought, this one is by far the best. Rather than adapting known characters to a story or to a game, this one was obviously written specifically for this age group. Our 18-month-old and 3-year-old are crazy about it, and have been playing it for a few months now. It is written so intuitively that once, while I was in the shower, our three-year-old started it up and was playing games on her own. She was SO pleased with herself, and I was thrilled. She now has mouse control and can play this one whenever she feels like it. She is more interested in more difficult games now, too. This wasn't a goal, really, I just wanted a game that would be fun, and this one has more than filled the bill. The author really understands the kinds of games and songs that kids this age enjoy - bubbles, baby animals, facial expressions, short stories, coloring, songs that they recognize. It's just the right speed and tone. I can't say enough about this game."

Banks have quirks that their own people don't know about so find the Quicken expert at each financial institution. Some specialty banks don't interconnect with Quicken. ""Quicken for Dummies"" was a help although it was written for PC not Mac. The writer said, ""financial planning tools are the most valuable features that Quicken offers."" -- I agree."
13424,1,"I was never a computer gamer. Too much blood and guts, shooting and killing, and a need for quick reactions. Long ago, I played a Lucas game called Loom, and loved it. It was a big step, in its time, because it didn't have the language commands...you just pointed and clicked. It was also a game for everyone, with puzzles to solve, and almost no violence - not to mention no time limits.Just last year, I succumbed to curiosity and purchased Myst. Oh, my! Then RealMyst and Riven. I was hooked! So now, I am waiting for the release of Exile, and needed something to occupy my mynd, and keep in practice for Myst III. I have contemplated Atlantis for a while, and finally caved in. I know the reviews are scathing, but I wanted something non-violent, and with lots of puzzles.I haven't been playing Atlantis long, but so far have had no problems. (PIII, nVidia, 733MHZ, 128MB RAM, 44xCD - I'd BETTER not have problems!) The game runs smoothly and quickly. I love the music, and the graphics are good, though not of the quality of the Myst series. (After RealMyst, nothing will ever be the same as far as games!) The characters look a little like Gumbys, but what the heck?! (Not sure why they didn't use real people, like Cyan.)The story line reminds me of the story line of the David Eddings series of fantasy novels about Belgarion, the keeper of the orb of light...VERY similar, so perhaps I am more willing to see a story here than those who have not read that series.As to the puzzles...diabolical! Love 'em! (I hope the game lasts until Exile comes out.) Too hard? Well, NOTHING can be harder than the marble puzzle in Riven. (I had to cheat...I could NOT see what I was supposed to on those topo maps on Spike Island!) Besides, I consider that the longer I have to work at it, the more I'm getting my money's worth.To those who put down adventure games because they are not shoot-em-ups: Give us a break! There are a lot of us out here who love these gentler, more mental games, and have a hard time finding them! (If there weren't a lot of us, would the Myst series have been so popular???) There are LOADS of games filled with violence...so play them, already, and leave us Myst-ies to our own devices!"

62028,1,"I tried a couple of other anti-spam programs and both were so time-consuming to set up or use that I gave up. Mailwasher was one. The gyrations I had to go through to set it up, then what I had to do to use it took more time than just deleting the spam would have taken. You have to open Mailwasher first, scan the messages, check a box for each message to be deleted or bounced, THEN your mail is downloaded to your mail server. THEN, you open your email program. I contacted their support when I couldn't access a button but was told that problem couldn't be happening. I figured I was just going to have to live with spam if I wanted to have email. Then, I found iHateSpam. I couldn't believe how easy it was to set up and how efficiently it got rid of spam. I use it on both Outlook and Outlook Express and, though it works a bit differently on each, it still keeps the spammers at bay. Finally, going through my email is not such a chore.There are just a couple of very small tweaks you need to do when your software is first installed. It already comes0 with a large set of parameters (filters) that ascertain what is spam and what is not. If a piece of spam does get through, with the press of a button you can bounce, report, or delete the message. You can then block either that particular sender or any email that originates from that domain.When I open Outlook, first Outlook downloads new messages. I can see all the email subject lines promising to help me lose weight, increase the size of my &quot;male organ&quot; (and I'm a female!) or make me rich. But, I don't have to do anything because then iHateSpam takes over. In just a very few seconds it wipes these emails away so all that is left are the emails I want to have. This saves ME the time it used to take finding and deleting all the spam messages. If I want to check the messages iHateSpam got rid of, I just go into the &quot;Quarantined&quot; file to check to make sure no friendly email has been put there. (Plus, it is a PLEASURE to see how many emails were quarantined that day without me having to do anything.)I heartily recommend this software to anyone who uses either Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express. The only drawback is that iHateSpam is not made for other email programs."

54232,1,"We have a family member with an autism spectrum disorder and dysgraphia (a learning disability.) We tried earlier versions, and they were awful. We probably wouldn't have considered buying Dragon NS again until we had a session with the OT staff at UIHC's Center for Disabilities. We tried V8 during the visit, and there's no comparison. It's just that much better. I would agree that the headset isn't as good (as the one we had from the earlier version,) but that's really an insignificant detail. Buy this because you need the software. Hardware issues can be easily resolved."
71725,0,"This game is actually pretty cool. However, be aware that it is an extreme challenge. The instructions are pretty bland. I find that the greatest challenge is moving around. Also, be aware at what this game is. You actually BUILD the Hogwarts interior, meaning the building is set up, but you have to place the furniture. Try to split your activities up, because constantly just placing furniture can get boring. It actually is a very cool game, but the controls bring the rating down ALOT. They are really confusing. It would have been better if lego had put a simple key bord movement-maybe even strafes. Having to controll a trax ball that is super sensative and page movements that you have to time or else you lose site completely can really start ticking you off. So, if you can figure controls out easily and get used to them quickly, this is the game for you. If not, then strongly reconsider this game."
40978,1,"This puzzle game truly bends your mind. Each puzzle is challenging, even on the easy level. Three levels of play would even give those at Mensa a difficult time. The three dimensional work has helped me picture things for my geometry homework more easily. Although the game does not actually focus on parts of the brain, it focuses on all aspects of logic and reasoning skills. Definently worth buying for all young puzzl solvers."

56674,0,"Unfortunately, there's not a lot out there if you're studying Uzbek. Which means it's nice to at least find a Talk-Now program for it. Like all Talk-Now programs, the game show interface works better for some vocabulary lists than others. And there are places where the vocabulary seems to differ from my dictionaries. But, then, the dictionaries aren't always in agreement either. Uzbek is a bit in flux. With that in mind, if you're looking for enough vocabulary to point out things and make clear what you're talking about, and to make a few polite requests, you could spend a lot more money to get a lot less. If you're just getting started in Uzbek, I'd recommend adding this to your collection."

72128,0,"I have to agree with the other review about the difficulties to install Project 2000. In fact at my office we've yet to have it completely set up to my entire satisfaction.However I would not give it two stars. I'd rate it three starts, because of the following:ON THE POSITIVE SIDE:-It allows for a very nice way to keep track of projects on a distributed environment, such as we have back at the office, where two developers (for example) work from their homes in distant cities. Project Central, the feature Project 2000 includes, which allows for a web-based project management interface is definitely the largest plus it comes bundled with.ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE:-The way to update the original Project files by means of the web-based update is very convoluted for the project manager: it generates one individual update per project where the person reporting back is working on, which can be very cumbersome if the person works in several (3-4) activities at the same time.-There is no way to make comments about the progress of each of the specific activities, in the form of a log, or something similar. So, an update from a person working on a project has to be coupled with a status report, which is not exactly what you'd call one of the best implemented features of Project.However, overall, I HAVE to acknowledge that it has helped me as Project Manager to have a better tracking of projects occurring left and right."
32949,1,"My son started torturing the computer at the age of 2, and still does three years later. We tried many games, but the software from Humongous is really the best, and the Freddi fish is a beatiful series of a crime/detective type. It's wery well designed, kids have a feeling of interacting with an animation movie. We ended up having all F.Fs and Putt-putts (other series from Humongous). Would advise to any parent to have it."
9834,1,"This movie had a sudden hit on me, and I don't understand exactly why. Maybe because of the brilliant plot, or the special effects or whatever? At the end of the day, you have to admit that Mortal Kombat is one of the best movies you've ever seen. The plot is nothing short of ( well you know, ritual stuff like in Buffy The Vampire Slayr etc) It is kind of a ritual or a religion or something. This sacred tournament has been going on for the past nine generations and guess what? The goon squad from Outworld have won them all! If Lord Rayden's team lose this time the whole world is lost! All in all, I'd say that this is deservedly one of the best movies ever made."
3439,0,"I don't need all the bells and whistles; I just need a program that can provide the forms with instructions and do the math. Unfortunately, TaxCut too often refers me to IRS instructions on the IRS website and to manual worksheets for common tax situations.To process a 1099-G, a refund on last year's state tax, the program referred me to a lengthy IRS publication, without even giving me the page or section reference. I had to fill out a manual (paper) worksheet and return the answer to the program. TaxCut already had all the data that was needed, but made me do the work anyway.To calculate variations on Kiddie taxes, the program makes the same requirement. It had all the data but they didn't bother writing a routine to do the calculations for me.The interface is somewhat cumbersome. It needs a good engineer who knows how real people work.Finally, it would be nice if TaxCut could offer two states with the program. If a competitor offers that feature, it would be decisive in my purchasing decision next year."

The email services and webpage hosting are the main reasons, but I also like the convenience of the automatic backup of my financial files to Apple's secure servers in Cupertino. The iDisk can be slow, depending on my Internet connection, but the files I save there are small so it doesn't take long to upload them. I think .mac is a good value and recommend it."
75502,1,"...along comes the sequel. Both games are incredible and addictive. My only complaint is that you can't have both the basic game and the expansion installed at the same time. However, that's a small problem in an otherwise wonderful program that is worth every penny."
82588,1,The unit does what the vendor claims but the software bundle lacks functionality. The up side to that is there is a lot of third party software that works with it and they make it more useful. I particularly liked Quo Vadis by Marcosoft and Magellan's NAV Companion. With out them I would rate the product 2 or 3 stars at best.
3160,1,"If you have your heart set on learning a language while sitting at the computer, then this is the best computer based language learning program there is. The competition in this genre is terrible. Rosetta Stone software is stable and usable. And it is the only program I've seen with a user interface that doesn't look like a children's book.Having said that, I wouldn't recommend that anyone who is serious about learning a language use a computer program as a primary tool. Sure, you need a computer to load up your mp3 player and write to your foreign language speaking pen pal. But it takes some really serious determination to sit in front of a computer, night after night for hours learning Spanish. Don't set yourself up for failure.Unless you are a very exceptional learner, you're going to have to practice for at least a half-hour every day. For me, that means fitting it into my lifestyle. I study while I'm driving, washing dishes, waiting in line, whenever. And I've been doing it for years. If I had to sit in front of a computer, it wouldn't have lasted a week.If you still really want computer based language training, this is the best I've seen. I believe they've added a third level to the Spanish program which should make it more complete. The boxed edition is very pricey, but Rosetta Stone has an online version for which you can pay monthly. They also have sample lessons on the website.I would recommend starting with an mp3 player and a good comprehensive audio course (Pimsleur or Platiquemos). Forget the computer programs, or use them as a supplement."
11324,1,"Prosoft Data Rescue PC did an excellent job bringing my 40GB of data back from Norton Ghost. It's like, if you haven't overwritten your Hard Disk with other data, you may just be fine using the Rescue PC.Yet, the quality of the CD itself that Prosoft shipped out is less than desirable. The disc is ugly, with flakes of shiny stuffs peeling of the surface of the disc. Plus, it is not a pressed CD, but rather a regular ""home made"" copy that burned right out of your PC's CD writer. Anyway, discs like that don't last for long.Still though, the overall rating is extremely positive! I give it 4.5 stars! It works very well!"

I highly recommend QuicKeys to my clients and friends for easy of use and for automating functions.How did I avoid hand wrestling with my computer mouse? I was able to eliminate unnecessary hand and wrist motions with my computer mouse when I had to complete several time consuming OCR (Optical Character Reader) projects.For example, I use OmniPage Pro for scanning information for my projects. By using QuicKeys, I was able to assign control function keys for OmniPage Pro's Scan Image, Perform OCR and Save As functions. Using these keyboard commands makes my work project easier plus saves me hours.Pro ReactionQuicKeys 5.0 is a time saver for Mac users using Mac OS 9 with its more robust features for reducing work project time. QuicKeys 5.0 is an excellent needed upgrade for the serious Mac users with fast Mac GS 3 and GS 4 computers. Also, QuicKeys is fun for new iMac computer users who want to add new toolbars and keyboard functions to their game menus.QuicKeys 5.0 makers saved paper by eliminating unnecessary printing of new manuals. The Addendum to QuicKeys 4.0 manual is concise. It shows you how to use the new functions of QuicKeys 5.0.Con ReactionI missed not having a Short Guide for using QuicKeys 5.0. The guide could have included installing the program, trouble shooting and launching programs for the first time QuicKeys user. Examples and Task projects for using QuicKeys could have included in the manuals. Also, a new Mac owner&#8217;s manual with visual instructions for using the QuicKeys functions would be appreciated.Final NotesControl Your Macintosh computer.

87376,0,"This would be a great game, but on the Mac it freezes up the whole machine after one or two minutes of play, and on the PC it loses sound intermittently. Also some of the activities evidently have not been properly play tested - e.g. the crane game requires far too much precision for a young child, otherwise it would be a great ""fine motor"" activity. I would say spend the extra $$$ and get Tonka Digs 'n' Rigs, which is very similar, is much more reliable, and comes with add on controls for the PC. [NB: since I originally wrote this review, we've had more success running this on the PC, and if we avoid the frustrating activities such as the crane, my 4 year old actually does get a lot of enjoyment from some of the other activities. I'll now upgrade my rating from 1 star to 3 stars, but I'd still recommend Digs 'n' Rigs over this title.]"
32234,1,"Excellent piece of software that I misplaced during my last move. Highly recommend this product, one of the most user friendly programs I've ever used. I really enjoy all of the features this piece of software has to offer, and I use it for my classroom on a regular basis."
28229,1,This is the software that is tons of fun and does not pollute your childs imagination! My kids spend hours playing this one and I like it because they are learning while they are playing in the story. The most important message in the story line is to help your friend in need. The game is rewarding and thus also make your kid feel like they have accomplished something. GOOD STUFF!
86053,1,I've seen some gripes about this product. To me is seems easy to use. Unlocking was fairly smooth. After that I was able to load the entire US map on a 2GB SD card (it takes a bit over 1GB so there's plenty of room left). After that I can find just about anything I need nearby from my eTrex Legend HCx.

74668,1,"I've been using Quicken 2002 Home & Business for a couple years now, and recently got a notice from Intuit that it's support ends in April. After reading the overwhelmingly negative feedback here, I was wary about upgrading to 2005. But then two things occurred to me:(a.) When I upgraded from Quicken 1999 to 2002 I read the same dismal feedback. And that upgrade went fine. and (b.) People seldom take the time to write positive feedback. It's usually only those folks that experience a negative upgrade that vent. (And perhaps, rightfully so)So I decided to upgrade. The software installed fine, and both my home and business files where correctly imported. All accounts continue to download just as they did before. The new interface will take some getting used to, but otherwise, everything is as it was before.The only small glitch I experienced was that Quicken had a tough time connecting to the internet, but I believe that might have been user error during initial selection of my connection.I'm still amazed the product does not better support tracking of US Savings Bonds, but that's a different story.Overall, I'm happy with the upgrade and have experienced none of the issues other reviewers have posted."
78577,2,"Truly, this is not quick or easy, mainly frustrating. Unless you're doing a VERY basic square room, forget it. Agree with the reviewer who said that error messages are frequent and inexplicable, and that work can disappear at any time. I'll add to that list that the software also freezes frequently, so save often. I fiddled with it for 2 hours in attempts to lay out our finished basement, which is one large U-shaped room with a smaller laundry room and stairs in the middle. Software froze twice, lost my edits several times, measurements inexplicably disappeared, and I finally resorted to good ol' pen and paper. I think this is a case where if you want software to do what you need it to do, you have to spend the big(ger) bucks."

49681,2,"Stay away from this software. I was a loyal and happy ACT customer for 8 years until I upgraded to this version, so I'm really sad to say that this version is a total nightmare. I've experienced tremendous problems, including being locked out of my database altogether. This software also glitched up my computer and basically brought the entire thing down at one point. If it wasn't for the fact that I have a super-techie husband, I never would have been able to retrieve my data or get things running (hobbling) again. Tech support is entirely WORTHLESS!!! Sorry, but find another product. I feel like I have no choice but to start searching other contact managers now. Bummer!!!!"
5538,1,I was able to write a power point presentation at work after just a few hours learning power point. The lessons are hands on and they show you exactly where to click or type in information. Better than a teacher because no tests and you can go over it till you get it right.

Also, the new additions of the Tree Lab and Metaballs add an unlimited amount of new ideas and creations one can come up with. It comes highly recommened."

60588,1,"This software is actually made by Official Software, LLC (not Enteractive, Inc. as shown in the product page). It uses an interactive interviewing function to step you through the trademark process. The function selects the correct forms that you need, and identifies the classification under which you need to file and lets you know what needs to be included in the submission package.Provided are editable forms from the USPTO, and advice (also from USPTO) for filling in the forms. As you fill in the forms using the interactive interview process you'll be building your submission package. The program also does online searches to ensure that your trademark is available. However, I strongly encourage you to not submit the completed package that the program builds without first consulting with an attorney who practices IP law. This program simplifies the process and does the up-front work, but is no substitute for competent legal advice from qualified professionals.If you are also pursuing copyright(s), you will find more value in the Intellectual Property Suite, which bundles this program with the companion program called Official Copyright Software 1.53, which will save money. Moreover, if you are seeking trademark(s) in connection with e-commerce or Internet products or services I strongly recommend that you read CyberRegs: A Business Guide to Web Property, Privacy, and Patents by Bill Zoellick."
52940,1,"Another reviewer raised a good point, that Creative Suite Premium includes scant printed documentation, compared with the printed documentation included if you purchase Photoshop, Illustrator, etc, separately. While it is all there in pdf format, for many of us, there is no substitute for printed user guides. It took a while to find it (have you ever tried to navigate Adobe's massive website?) but I finally discovered that you can purchase all of the printed documentation for the tools includes in Creative Suite Premium package for a nominal fee directly from Adobe. The best way to find that page is to google the string ""Supplemental User Guides for Adobe Creative Suite"". To me, this discovery makes Adobe Creative Suite Premium a much more attractive purchase."
70186,1,"McAfee Total Protection is not able to be located on the McAfee website, but you can get tech support on the product. They apparantly don't sell it anymore. Nevertheless, it is a good product. The greatest complaint I have about it is that it consumes lots of resources, especially at startup, when it calls home and downloads updates and also starts scans. You can schedule the scans for a different time, but the downloads happen at startup. And during startup, while these downloads are happening, you might as well go get a cup of coffee, because the computer will practically not respond to any commands! Also, the program interrupts with a warning message when ANYTHING changes on your system. Most times this is the result of something you are doing, like downloading and installing a new program. It always pops up at bootup...apparantly a Registry Key changes every time the machine boots up. I'm going to try Norton Internet Security. PC Magazine echoed my comments in their Dec. 26, 2006 ""The Best of the Year"" article."
5762,1,"First off, there is very little reason to hire your tax form out to some bozo at H&amp;R Block, and none at all for fiddling about with paper forms, a pencil, and an eraser. The software really does the job. I have been using H&amp;R Block Tax Cut for the past three years, and I favor the basic edition without bells and whistles. Why buy more than you need? The &quot;deluxe&quot; and &quot;platinum&quot; (what's next, titanium?) versions have very little to do with the nitty gritty of filling out a tax form. Basic is better! -- Dan Ford"
25659,1,"I ran McAfee on my computers for about 5 years. As time went by and they kept up-grading their programs, my computers had a harder time running the programs until finally, I had to give up and take it to the repair shop. Even the repair shop had a hard time getting McAfee to run on my computer which is a Compaq 5700T. It kept crashing my computer and causing all kinds of problems. Then on the last upgrade, I could either run the Virus Scan program or the Firewall but not both. I said &quot;that's it&quot;........I bought SystemWorks and everything runs beautifully. No problems and it does what it's supposed to. I love it. Dixie Negless"
92572,2,"This game may sound cool, but it isn't.1.) You must complete 7 long, boring, and fairly pointless tutorials to get to any real building.2.) Whenever you click any button (ANY BUTTON) the helper dude talks for about two minutes. Basicly, you are forced to listen to a non-stop stream of yaking while attempting to play the game.3.) The game is not user-friendly. You cannot undue any of your actions during the game (accidently deleted the castle you spend five hours building? Too bad. Can't bring it back).4.) Not really any actual battles. There is no way to damage, or even effect, any other lego guys most of the time. The only things that destroy legos are the cannons you can build, and even those have very lame explosion effects and no sound.5.) Too hard to build your own models, and it is impossible to actually build a large castle of your own (unless you are willing to commit your life to it).6.) Possibly the coolest part of the game-battering rams-do not do anything. There is no way to inflict damage upon walls using anything other than the two kinds of cannons you can build.7.) Frequently freezes and crashes (locks-ups). Game was poorly designed.8.) Even young children such as my little brother (age 11) find this game boring and poorly-designed. A direct quote: ""It made my eyes bleed!"" Although melodramatic, that quote kind of sums the entire game.9.) No way to control how characters move. They just run around in random patterns.10.) Animations are okay, but fairly poor quality. Many clipping glitches.11.) It changes your screen resolution almost permanently and messes up some system settings.12.) No/incompatent tech support, so if it breaks, it is gone forever. You probably won't be able to tell the difference.Bottom Line:This is the worst game I have ever played. Even children ages 4-6 will hate this game beyond reckoning. This game is total crap.Don't waste a penny buying it!"
47061,1,"I had been planning on purchasing a color correction system for my computer for some time, but until Pantone Huey was released, I had not been able to find an affordable yet accurate colorimeter. For under $100, you can't beat this simple & sophisticated device.I was a little apprehensive of ordering a product so newly released, but I put my worries aside and purchased Huey, since it was less than half the price of the other models I was considering. Huey has lived up to my expectations, and was worth the investment. It has been easy to use: setup took less than five minutes, the directions are clear and concise, and the program walks you through each step onscreen.Huey sits next to my monitor, unobtrusively monitoring ambient (room) light and taking any changes into account (this feature can be disabled easily). The ambient light adjustment was a huge selling point for me -- other models offering this option were upwards of $200.While I can't make detailed adjustments of the color temperature, Huey's program allows you to select varying color settings based on whether you plan to edit photos, play computer games, or browse the web. Huey also allows you to compare your ""before"" and ""after"" monitor calibrations. I think you will be suprised at how much better it makes your screen look -- I know I was.I am more than satisfied with my investment, as Huey's simplicity and automation has saved me time and effort while providing me with a color corrected monitor that I can trust to be accurate."
70981,1,I bought this game for my 9 year old daughter and she is having great fun with it. I am having fun with it as well (more than I probably should admit). It is very clever and I believe it provides a nice combination of entertainment and creativity. The puzzle challenges are good and the ability to create endless numbers of your own puzzles for others to solve is even better.

1197,1,"This is a recently released product, so that's why you don't see very many reviews. I'll tell you, based on my own experience of running Peter Norton's software since the early DOS days (1984/85), there is something wrong with either your Operating System installation (XP or otherwise) or your hardware if you can't get this beautiful suite running on your machine.I loaded it yesterday on a Pentium 2GHz / 1GB RAM / 60GB hard drive and this is very nice. The protection is comprehensive -- you get Anti-Virus, Firewall, and SPAM in one box. I'm not a salesperson for Symantec, just a long-time customer of theirs, so I have nothing to gain by raving about their products. One major flaw in their product designs is that they mix and match individual components (anti-virus, firewall, utilities, disk imaging) in various different ""suites"" or packages, and I know that can cause problems on systems that have multiple versions of all the Symantec DLLs and all those registry entries cross-referencing each other.Sorry to get too techy, but I think this is an excellent product and they have made great progress since their 2003 and 2004 versions."
43904,1,This product is a very easy product to adjust to. Adjustment however is what you will have to do because the basic functions are not under the standard menu as previous versions. It can be a little fustrating in the beginning but overall is a good product.
50056,0,"I have been an avid Apple/Nintendo fan for a long time buying every product they come out with. Ipods, Imacs, and software. If I could I would go back to my Tiger because my external Harddrive is too small for me to get the benefits of Time Machine and if you buy a big external HD, they don't last as long as smaller ones. Second, the applications they added were no better as they hyped it up to be. The new photobooth stuff always come in choppy for me when I am in the ocean, or at the beach. My eyes are scratched out. The .Mac updates are great, and the Iphoto works wonderfully and I love the new events and a great way to better organize your pictures. The new imovie makes it impossible to edit/fade, and move around audio/pictures and video as it did in the last version. Front row is perhaps the only thing I love about leapord. Coverflow is the best thing in leapord and I love showing off my album artwork with a remote.In the meantime I will wait for the next apple OS = Lions,Monkeys,Panda or maybe when they add the Beatles to Itunes they will have their new operating system Abbey Road."

The nervouse system is not broken out into specific nerves. Nueurotransmitters are mentioned and illustrated in a cartoon animation but no detail is provided.

I tore my hair out for a few hours, then threw it on the WAREZ heap, where it will probably stay.Good for beginners after a cheap solution. Maybe if you're trying to do something tricky, you should invest more dollars, though...."
27133,1,"I really like this game, especially that you get to drive [having 4 more years before I can even touch a wheel, this is awesome! :-)]and that it is set in 1930 (awesome!), and that you get to use a 1930 payphone (don't ask me why I like this, I just do. Maybe because you don't have to dial numbers? YAY!),and that you can talk to Nancy's dad (first time ever!) and that in my opinion, Bess and George are really funny in this one (and they have ""a nosy busybody"", as Bess puts it, sharing their phone line), and that you get to go fishing (though it's not exactly hard. Strange, the fish is in the same place.....EVERY. TIME.) and that there's a minature golf course (which, though sometimes annoying, is actually quite fun overall)! Sooo... what don't I like? For one thing, saying the game is based on the book is exagerating. Hello? The game is nothing like the book. OK, there's a clock. Oh look, another clock. And- *GASP* - ANOTHER clock???? As I recall, the book had ONE CLOCK (that was significant) in it! Also, Nancy stays at Lilac Inn in........the FOURTH book! Plus about every other change you can think of. (Guess what? In the game, the banker, Jim Archer, is about 50 and married, and the president of a bank. In the book, Helen Corning marries Jim Archer. I can tell you this: the two Jim Archers are NOT the same person.) OK. I don't really care if it's not like the book, it would be cool, bubt also pointless- you already know what is going to happen! So, I can see why the game is nothing like the book, but saying it is based on the book is not true! (In case you read the book and you think you know what the game is like.) I didn't really like the ending. It's different, which is good, but...I don't like it. (It's a...chase. No more said in case I spoil the ending.) But even though I probably seem like I hate the game, I actaully like it. It has pretty good graphics, an ""upgrade"" for the most part, there are quite a few puzzles, none particuarly challenging but more or less interesting, I like all the characteres, though Richard Topham and Jan Willobee talk a LITTLE too much. Plus I wanted to... do something to Jane. She annoys me SOOOO much.But she's funny (not on purpose)at least, her eyebrows go waaaaay up. It's funny. LOL. See for yourself. I actually reccomend this game if you don't mind solveing it quickly (I solved it in 7-8 hours, about 3-4 hours per day). It's good for beginners and people who like fast-movingn games. Overall, it's not at all a bad game. I play it over and over again!"
56104,1,"I bought this because I wanted to run some Windows only software on my iMac without spending the full amount for Windows XP Professional or Vista and I don't see what's worse about this ""OLD VERSION"" because it still has Service Pack 2. So far, this version seems able to do what I need it to do.Attention Mac users, if you buy and install a copy of Windows, be sure to also install the drivers on the Mac OS X install disc. Without them, you'll have trouble with Wi-Fi and Windows Movie Maker, among other things. Also keep in mind that while you can have a Windows partition larger than 32GB by NFTS partions, you'll need to use FAT32 if you want to write to the windows partition from the Mac partition. I have FAT32 so I can transfer photos and videos that need to be edited without having to put them on to DVD's first.About the Bootcamp instruction guide, if you're sure you know what you're doing, then don't worry about printing it. If you don't know a lot about computers, then I'd recommend that you use it. The Windows software can only be installed a few times (I believe it's four, but don't count on this) before it will no longer accept the product key, forcing you to have to buy another copy so you'll want to try to make sure that you install it properly on the first time."
6079,1,"I started out with the pc Basic fax, upgraded to the 9.0 version when I upgraded my computer and then upgraded again to the 10.0 version of Winfax. No matter which version, it's easy to use easy to install and very handy and helpful to have. I don't fax often but when I do I know I can rely on Winfax 10.0 to perform exactly as stated. And you don't need a manual or book to learn how to use it. The manual and instructions included in the program is all you really need.I would like to add this statement from a previous or what another reviewer wrote: ""Amazon states that 10.0 will work with Windows XP. Version 10.02 is required according to Symantec's own website.""My search shows not only does Amazon state 10.0 will work with windows xp, Symentec's own web site states the same thing.

So far so good.The bad:After playing the game (helping my son) for about 2 hours from beginning to end, my mind was numb and I was nervous.The suggetion:Instead of buying computer games for you kids, just go in the garden with them and let them help you water the plants and such things. Works with my kid, gives him exercise too."

There are thousands of clip art images, and you can import your own photos, and then crop them with provided shape or by hand, you can even give them an older look. The choices of font are amazing! You can even create your own headlines, with different colors, textures, shapes, shadows, and outlines to add to the text. The program offers ready-made projects, assistance with projects, or you can create your own from scratch. With all the options for cards you'll find yourself making all the cards and invites you need for any occasion. You'll be amazed at everything you can create!

76343,2,I've been a loyal user of TurboTax for the last 8 years. This year's version is the worst because Intuit is no longer in the business of making a good product that is simple & complete for an average user.Intuit is indirectly forcing its customers to upgrade to the premier version (for another $30) to get features such as ISO/ESPP which were available as standard before.I think this is the last time I'll be using TT.
37044,2,"This is the second review I have written for this product - the first review was never posted.I had high hopes when I purchased this set, especially with all the products combined into one. Unfortunately, the interface and the inability to update the databases give it a failing grade.The encyclopedia is based on the &quot;Versaware&quot; system wherein you can add titles to a database (or update titles) residing on your computer and then the titles appear in a pane on the left margin of the screen. The titles come as described in the advertisements, but they are from 2000. When you try to update them, you can't. When try you go to the Versaware web site, you find that it is up for sale - out of business - kaputt. I also don't like the inability to use one title without opening up the whole program. And if you want to look up pictures or multimedia files, the program forces you to switch the two CDs you get back and forth in order to get the content.If you want a clunky out of date product, plunk down your money. Otherwise, you'd be better off looking at one of the other encyclopedia compliations."
79461,0,I'm a professional photographer and bought this program that was endorsed by other outstanding photographers.I've been using this software for 3 yrs now. I have truly loved it for it's ease of use. Drag and drop system. It's gotten better over the years as its gotten auto rotate on pictures and better music manipulation. This program is great for small productions. 20 to 50 pictures. The program can't seem to handle a whole lot. It constantly freezes and shuts down (it does have an auto save feature that they obviously needed). I've also had many problems with the writing process. It's wasted many a dvd for me. Not all dvd players recognize the burn as well.For those who run on a network this is definitely not the program for you. I've talked with customer support and they stated to me that the program will not operate with pictures on another computer over the network.Today I had my last straw with the program and will be finding something else.Thanks!!! and good luck!!!

I prefer to not have to export my data to a comma delimited or other format in order to get it into my phone. Now that the bulk of my data has transferred, I will undoubtedly make future entries from the phone screen manually."
49183,2,My older programs that I liked won't work with it. My wireless connection keeps checking out unlike when using XP. There are a lot more reboots as opposed to my experience with XP. Seems Micro Soft ought to issue an apology for this mistake. Stick with XP if you can.

83510,1,"After using many image editing software packages, I found Photoshop Elements does what I need faster than any other.My criteria is based on how fast I can: 1. Get an image from my scanner or digital camera 2. Crop it 3. Fix red eye 4. Adjust overall brightness, contrast, color. 5. Darken or lighten specific areas 6. Save it .jpgPractically all the software I've used can do all of my list, although some packages can't darken or lighten specific areas. Some programs are so simple that they become hard to work with; It takes forever to crop a picture with Microsoft Picture It. Adobe PhotoDeluxe will only save as a .pdd, you have to do several extra steps to export it as a .jpg.I really don't use all the extra features and filters and special effects, although PhotoMerge is pretty cool. I know my way around a darkroom, but photography isn't my life. I just want to clean up pictures and move on. Adobe Photoshop Elements allows me to improve and correct my pictures quickly. But when I want to do something artistic, it works great.Look... Buy or Go to your local library and check out the book ""50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques"". It has a CD that contains trial versions of Photoshop Elements as well as several other programs. Try them side by side. Find the one that works best for you, I'll bet it's Photoshop Elements."
72921,1,"There seems to be a lot of misinformation in these reviews. Go to the Intuit website if you have any questions or concerns. One of the things I read on their website is that the product activation key isn't needed after October 2003, which means in the future you can install the software on a new computer without having to repurchase the software. I for one am going to go ahead and buy TurboTax. It hasn't let me down yet and I have been using it for several years!"

45652,1,"This software manages to hit that sweet spot of lots of user controllable functions but unburdened by rampant featuritis. Want to change something? Just double-click on it, that will likely do it - you won't have to navigate through a zillion menus. I use KaleidaGraph (KG) for nearly all my graphing needs and a lot of analysis gets done on it as well. The quality of the plots is better than what you see in a lot of publications. The macro capability is great - you can automate analysis of data files output by other devices as KG has superb import capability. The Tech Support staff is great too - when I call with a question or problem they usually have an answer right away and if they don't, they actually get back to me in short order with a solution; plus they know this software inside and out. Highly recommended."

49829,1,"My experience with &quot;Professor Teaches..&quot; was benefical and hassle-free. I was and am (I am still working my way through the tutorials) quite satisfied with the self-paced process of learning not only the basics of Microsoft Office components, but also aspects of their functioning I had little or no knowledge of. One CD is devoted to each component aspect of Microsoft Office. You can stop and start the session at will and when you begin agian you are at the point you just left off.The information is presented in a straight fowrard, easy-to-comprehend manner. The interactive nature of this product allows the student to perform tasks associated with each topic.I took the opportunity to take detailed notes as I went through each exercise, givng me a quick reference quick to use once I completed each lesson- so far I have completed the Microsoft Word and Outlook modules and am one-third of the way through the Excel module.The only draw-back I experienced this product is that it worked best when installed as a program rather than used as a CD.Also I think the edition I purchased had a lot of stuff I didn't really need like Office ME and 2000. Now I need to get the set with Frontpage and the other Web design programs.Again, I found this product to be extremely satisfactory."
30998,1,"I've owned Video Studio 7, 9, and now 11. I love 11. Its a easy to use in all facets. I'm not sure if it has a tutorial like its predecessors because now that I've progressed from 7 to 9 to 11, I haven't needed it. I love the layout and how simple it is to put together a movie. More importantly are the enhancements: You can have up to 6 layers of video/pictures on screen at one time. Very cool! You can also now adjust the fading out of music for any length of time you'd like. You can easily cut video and music with ease.Two things that I have found that I don't care for are when you delete a segment of video, sometimes it will delete the music layer with it. Also, when you add pictures or video from a file on your computer, with each file you add and go back to add another, it won't take you right back to the previous folder you were in. Small things, but annoying none the less. Definitely not annoying enough to not buy this product. I think this version of Video Studio is unbelievable. I absolutely love it for what I do, which is create 45 minute movies on my kids each year (highlights of the past year at each birthday). Tons of fun!"
18654,0,"My annual Christmas present to myself has been a Quicken upgrade for as long as I can remember--way back to the DOS days. For years, the program just got better and better. Now, I am not so sure. The last couple of years, it has looked different, but little else has changed. The decrease in simlicity is actually a step backward. At the very least, $75.00 is way too much for what you get. If you have 2003, or even 2002, stay put."
41530,0,"So I purchased my copy of Logo Creator 2.0 at the local office retailer. My curiosity was that a logo creation software could put me out of business as a graphic designer. I shelled out the $15. The program crashed over, and over again. I thought, ""oh, good. I'm safe"".So I contacted the makers (Summitsoft) and told them I wasn't happy. They quickly emailed me back and told me I should download the latest version for free, which was version 3.6.It works, and now I can honestly say, dollar for dollar this is the very best value I have ever received from software. I own Adobe/Macromedia design products such as Illustrator, Freehand, Fireworks, and Photoshop. They provide the highest degree of control and freedom for profession work. But LogoCreator can do basic image, text, object minipulation quickly, and easily. It exports files in a variety of common file formats. (Earlier versions didn't export files in EPS). It really excels as a web navigation tools editor.I recently purchased a version for my Mac. It is even more stable, and has more features.Will I lose clients to this product? Probably not, on account that LogoCreator doesn't have drawing tools. And, most people I work for want me to create something fresh and multi purpose, which means it can be used for both web and print media. But for the person who cannot afford a professional designer and is willing to do the learning curve, this product is very, very good.I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! 3 Stars only, because the user interface takes a while to figure out and the preview box seems always to be in the way."
4323,0,"This is really just ZoneAlarm's firewall combined with CA's personal anti-virus software. Installation was terrible (I had ZoneAlarm previously installed, and it conflicted).

34754,1,"I almost didn't buy this product due to all the bad reviews. I've used it for years and decided to give this year's a try anyway. I had no problem installing the product (running Win98 SE on an AMD 900Mhz if this helps someone). If you follow the quickstart guide, the instructions it gives are what any user should do when installing new software. I was up and running in under 30 minutes after having TurboTax install the latest software update.Yes, it's true you can't install on more than one computer as far as filing and printing your taxes goes. If you want to install it but not sure that's the computer you're going to use to file, take the option to install it as a trial option. You can still do your taxes. When you're sure of which computer you're using, then activate the software. It hardly took any time at all to activate my copy. As for the licensing software c-dilla IS NOT spyware. I checked the vendor's site and it's been used by other companies. The rumors about the software disabling your burner aren't true - my machine has been working just fine.Once you activate your product, you can print to another computer if you save your tax file under the new PDF feature. Then you can use Adobe Acrobat Reader to open and print it. TurboTax walks you through filling out your taxes in an interview fashion.You can start from scratch or bring in last year's TurboTax file. You can also see the forms it's helping you fill out. There's plenty of help available if you get stuck. This version doesn't come with the IRS publications included (if you want that, get Deluxe), but that wasn't a problem for me - I already downloaded them from the IRS website. If you decide to e-file, there's a rebate form in the box for the e-filing fee, so you end up paying $0 to file and TurboTax makes it really easy.Also received my income tax refund last week - around the time TurboTax estimated the IRS would direct deposit it. That was including me having to resend it due to accidentally not typing in a number when I first e-filed. I wasn't charged for the resend.If you do get errors, all I can tell you is check Intuit's website. I went there and I saw their error list - some are fixable, others weren't fixed yet. They do have a money back guarantee if you have problems with it. Sorry to those people who had heartburn trying to use it. Seems like Intuit didn't quite test their product out before shipping with this many people having problems, but in my case, it worked for me the same as it always has :-)"

82504,1,"Works great on my Macbook AND my Vista machine (which is used less and less as I revel in the joy that is ""Mac OS X""). The amount of information available is staggering. I was somewhat underwhelmed by the AllSky survey, but when I consider it only adds 60 to cost (compared to Pro) and other enhancements are included as well, the ""Plus"" is well worth it. be prepared for a total install of almost 12Gb if you copy the AllSky to the local drive (recommended).I can certainly understand passing up Pro Plus for just Pro, but if you have the extra, I think it's well worth the money spent...***Vista issues seem to have been addressed in the current version.

64552,1,"I think this game is when the company really got into it's groove. The first two were fun, don't get me wrong, but it's with this one that we really start to get into the intrigue that I love about these games so much. This also sets up for the ever-present light spook factor that is present from here until Blackmoor.I played this game as a child, put it away for a few years, then pulled it out and played it again recently. I could still recite the games poem perfectly. ""Listen my child to this story of dreams..."" I loved that. I think I annoyed my mother with how many times I repeated back when I first received the game in 2001/2002.For people looking to get into the series, I might recommend this to you, but make sure you get another game (preferably from the first eleven, if you want a true example of what this company can do) to accompany it. It does have it's issues, since it is so old and only the third game they made, but it's also an extremely satisfying game."

53458,0,"ART sells two versions of this software: the ""suite"" version for about $99, and the ""pro"" version for $495. I bought the cheaper software and have regretted it. The most obvious problem for me is the inability to customize wall thicknesses and layers. My house has a concrete block wall on the first level, with a thick layer of stucco on the outside, and then a layer of insulation on the inside, covered with plywood, metal lathe and then plaster. There is simply no way to draw a wall like that in the basic version: you are stuck with a handful of basic wall types and no real ability to draw the wall layers. Reading their help pages revealed that this is a feature that ART deliberately removed from the suite version in order to force people to upgrade to pro...For what it's worth, I've also tried 3D Home Architect Deluxe 6.0 and it seems to have the same problem. Very limited customization for walls. I couldn't even get a stucco finish on the exterior walls as far as I could tell.Anyway, despite my irritation at having forked out (...) for an unusable product, I figured I had no choice but to upgrade to the pro version. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that there's no direct upgrade path, as far as I can see - to upgrade you have to fork out almost (...) for the Pro version and just throw away the earlier software. Oh yes, ART does offer a (...) rebate if you upgrade within 30 days, but this still leaves you $50 out of pocket. This rebate seems a little odd on their part, since they also offer a full money back guarantee within 30 days, which, needless to say, I am about to take advantage of.In conclusion, I would jump either straight to the pro version, which seems to be a worthwhile piece of software according to reviews I've seen; or try something cheaper. 3DHA has a free trial that can be downloaded, and it'll give you a pretty good idea what's available in the suite version of Home Designer."

Since I'm not very computer savy, it took me a little extra time to figure out some of the settings. It works well.

24189,1,"My younger sisters and I have been homeschooled for years, and our math teacher makes a point of bringing math computer programs for us to play durig the week. She brought us &quot;Logical Journey of the Zoombinis&quot; a few years ago, and we all became hooked. Even my older sister gave it a try. Once we figured out how to solve the puzzles, we had so much fun. Then we lost the CD and couldn't find it anywhere.A few months ago, we saw this on amazon.com and were delighted! Of course we ordered another copy. Being older (14 1/2, 12, and 10 1/2) we had learned more math and were able to get to the higher levels. That's where we started having problems with it.The levels go from extremely easy to ridiculously difficult in so little time. It would be better if they spent more time on each level and worked your way up gradually, or if they didn't even get to levels that are so difficult. Not one of us (including my oldest sister, now 17) has won Zoombinis. This isn't even because we haven't figured out how to solve the highest levels, because we have. It's because of another problem with the game. You have to get way too many Zoombinis to Zoombiniville (over 500, I think). Each trip, which can take about forty-five minutes, transports only sixteen Zoombinis. After maybe ten max trips, you're on the highest level. That's pretty hard, and you get bored with doing the same things over and over. As it is, none of us have gotten very many past 200 to Zoombiniville. We simply get bored.Plus, it says that the age range is 8 and up. Don't let this fool you. A very intelligent 8-year-old would probably be able to figure out the level-one and level-two puzzles, but not many puzzles on higher levels.My final verdict is: Great game, lots of fun, but gets too hard too easily and would take too long to actually win."
53639,1,"One day there was a little boy named Linus Torvalds. He liked to play with computers and get them to do things. And on one very special and fateful day, he was astounded by a friend of his who was using something called UNIX. It was better, faster and did more than anything he'd ever seen before. &quot;Where can I get this UNIX?&quot; he asked? &quot;And for how much?&quot; That day he learned that not everyone could use UNIX. It was expensive. So, being a savvy, industrius and inventive little tyke, Linus set about writing his own version. It would be called LINUX, it would be every ounce as powerful, and would be free! And every little boy and girl could make their own improvements because he would give away the source code! ...Of all the LINUX distributions, SLACKWARE has been defined as the most 'UNIX'-like. It is also among the oldest, most developed and often the most advanced of the LINUX flavors. All of that aside, I found it to be the most useful way to learn to use LINUX. Let me explain... The installer is a script, with a less than impressive 'DOS' looking interface. But do not let the look fool you. Under the hood, it is every ounce the musclebound goliath you want it to be. Don't judge a distribution based on this; they may look different, but most installers have the same general set of options. Pay attention to the screen when linux is booting whether off of floppies or CD. This will tell you some valuable things (like what additional kinds of starage devices the kernel has already recognized in your machine). This makes less work and less confusion later on. If you have another drive with Windows on it, SLACKWARE can usually detect it and make it available from within your LINUX session. If you can set up SLACKWARE, you will do fine. Setting up XWindows is a great first lesson in your new environment. Find out what kind of hardware you have in your machine. SLACKWARE takes nothing for granted. You will need to tell XWindows what kind of mouse, video card and monitor you have, and d which display settings you would like to use. Why all the fuss? When you are done you will already have a good working knowledge of how LINUX and XWindows works. Using SLACKWARE means that you have a better idea of what's going on inside LINUX. Other distributions tend to remove you from the command prompt, which is LINUX in it's truest form. This means that you don't really get to see how things work, and you're not 'really learning' anything but the difference between Windows and XWindows. XWindows is not an operating System. It is a Shell or window manager. Explorer.exe and it's related components are the Windows Shell (the start button, Task Bar, System Tray, Desktop and its own kind of Window Manager). This is where the similarities end. LINUX is a much more powerful OS than Windows. Hands Down. The operating system is the command prompt. You need to learn the LINUX command prompt in order to understand how LINUX works. This will help you know what's wrong when something doesn't work, and it will empower you with a dynamic command of the LINUX OS. You almost can't set up SLACKWARE without actually learning how it works. The books are fine and the 'man' command can save your life, but nothing is as rewarding as realizing that you are the reason it works. The learning curve here 'is' the reward. Other distributions do not offer this kind of trial-by-fire approach, but when you come out on the other side of the installation of other distributions, you haven't learned much, if anything. Q) Why learn SLACKWARE? A) It's the Most like UNIX. It costs next to nothing. And it is a first rate powerhouse of an OS. Oh yeah, and you might actually 'learn' LINUX. SLACKWARE is for those of us who want to know how things work and how to 'make' things work. like what, you ask? Almost 90% of the internet is composed of UNIX or LINUX clients and servers. No kidding, when asked what he thought of the growing public interest in the internet, Bill Gates said, 'It's a phase'...'that will pass'. Boy, he was wrong on a GALACTIC scale! But this gave LINUX developers the opportunity to write the protocols and environments that are the internet as we know it. LINUX out-sold Windows in Japan last year in new OS purchases. Why? You can make LINUX anything you want it to be. Router (internet traffic) software and Tivo (record days of Television at a time digitally) machines and the SONY PlayStation2 (Everything from videogames to DVD player to internet box+ a lot LOT more) software development kit use LINUX. For example, after Microsoft had owned HotMail for awhile, they decided that it looked silly for them to be running a mail service on LINUX. So they set everything up on WindowsNT. And crashed for three straight days. Now it is being run on LINUX again. Enough said. If you do not want to know how things work, but want to use a powerful distribution, use something else. But if you are serious about 'learning' LINUX, SLACKWARE is as close to UNIX as you can get. And that's what's keeping us all connected. You can have a working http (web) ftp and telnet server in no time at all."
91702,1,"This is a great game for toddlers. My daughter and son loves it. The only thing is that the cd provides only the first two lessons.

31559,1,"Faced with an expiring trial version of Norton's Anti-Virus 2004, I went to renew my subscription to keep the program up-to-date. Finding that it would only be a few dollars more to upgrade to the 2005 version, which included a new one-year subscription, I decided to go the upgrade route. Before I did, I checked reviews of the new version, including reviews on Amazon.There certainly is a wide variety of opinion on this product. After reviewing all available information, and in spite of a lot of negative reviews, I decided to go ahead and upgrade to the 2005 version. Bear in mind, this addresses only the Anti-Virus program, not the whole Internet Security suite, which I did not purchase.I have a notebook that is a couple of months old. It has a 1.4GHz Celeron M processor with 512MB of RAM. As I mentioned, it came with a limited trial version of Norton's Anti-Virus 2004 installed, and everything worked just fine. I installed the upgrade to Anti-Virus 2005 and have had no problems with the change. Yes, it took a while to install. The actual installation took somewhere between ten and fifteen minutes, with an initial total system virus scan taking another half hour on my computer (which I could have skipped if I had wanted to). This is a pretty long install time, but that didn't really matter to me. I was only installing it on one computer and had no need to rush through the installation. Heck, I was watching TV while it installed, so no time lost for me.As for a performance hit, I have not detected any difference. I have not been able to verify the supposed slower loading of web pages. It seemed that there might be a very slight delay, but I couldn't see it consistently, nor did it affect my browsing to any degree at all.I did not let Norton close down the Microsoft firewall as they recommended. I would rather keep it running than to rely only on Norton to watch for worms. This does not seem to have affected the function of the AV program.My experience has so far been positive. A long install time? Yes, but I'm not installing it every day. Affect the speed of my browsing or any other computer functions? Nothing that is noticeable, or at least the 2005 version does not appear to have any more impact than the 2004 version did. I have no problem recommending an upgrade from Norton Anti-Virus 2004 to the 2005 version."

20604,1,"I'm a newbie to video, a long time computer user, and a guy with no spare time. So over the Christmas holiday I decided to try to make a few short movies out of 3 video tapes that I shot this summer. I surfed the Web to find cables and software, and ordered Studio 8 based on reviews by PC Magazine, ZD Net UK, Kurt von Behrmann, etc. I also bought Jan Ozer's book to try to get the most out of Studio. Before my Studio software order arrived, I read the customer reviews... oh SH*$#, I thought. It's buggy beta software, and I just wasted my time and money on it! If only I had read the reviews before I ordered... Well I received and installed Studio yesterday, and I've already created 3 movies from about 2 hours of video tape, including productions niceties like titles, fades and fancy transitions, background music; way beyond what I thought I could do or what the supposedly buggy software could do. I'm delighted. My equipment is all standard out-of-the box stuff:- 2.4 GHz Dell Dimension 3600C (with Pentium 4)- 512 MB RAM- 120GB Ultra ATA/100 hard drive- Integrated Intel 3D AGP video (standard on this Dell PC)- Internal 24X CD-RW/DVD drive- Sony DCR-TRV22 mini DV camcorder (has IEEE 1394 FireWire interface)- Studio version 8.10.4.0 serial number 1018064178 (I got the latest code fixes as soon as I installed the CD, as per Jan Ozer's recommendation)On the dark side, I've hit a couple snags. The program hung-up once, but I did not lose anything important as I was careful to save my project regularly (because of those complaints I read about the stability). I'm also scratching my head about creating a VCD disk... I guess I'll have to purchase a DVD burner after all.On the plus side, I've loaded about 2 hours of DV video without losing a single frame; and I made a terrific video of my twin granddaughters at Rye Playland. My wife and I watched it 4 times already, and I just cut it this afternoon! Those girls are the cutest things on the face of the Earth...and if you don't believe me, I have a video I can show you!!"
28940,0,"As a JASC product, Quick View Plus is a bit disappointing. I am used to high quality products coming out of JASC, and almost always give them the highest recommendations. Although I would recommend Quick View Plus, not so much as other JASC products. Quick View Plus will open most any type of document, particularly helpful if you have to frequently change from Macs to PCs. I am a student at a University and as such sometimes use Mac files, mostly PC. Before purchasing this product, I was unable to view any files saved in Mac formats, now this is no longer the case. The files that it does view, however, range in quality from good to poor depending on the type. Poor quality, however, is still better than nothing at all. Quick View Plus is fairly customizable as to what it integrates with, and does its work when necessary without overburdening me. Another great feature is the archiving program. With Quick View Plus, you can create ZIP files for use, however I still prefer WinZip. If you are in need of a program for viewing formats not on your PC, then this is a program for you to look at. If you only occasionally need to view these kinds of files, maybe you should let the sender print you out a copy. For the price, it will all depend on how often you intend to use the program."
29677,1,"If you're open to a somewhat steep learning curve (depending on how much you know about synthesis and programming concepts), Max may be the tool for you. I love the sounds I can make without feeling like I'm stuck in a sequencer. It definately requires patience but it's worth it. I am not sure if this is true, but it seems like there's more community support for Max/Msp/Jitter than for Reaktor (even though it's supossed to be easier to learn). I hope to continue to grow and be able to create my own plugins for Live and Logic."

8002,1,"Biggest concern was how all the major applications would react to the new OS X, mainly MS office and CS2 software. They seem to work well, sometimes an unexpected quit here and there but not that frequent. Navigating through files has been streamlined, great for those of us who work on the computer all day. There are so many thoughtful new features with this upgrade, that when you discover each new one, it confirms that upgrading was the right choice."
39363,1,"I like Keynote. It makes it blissfully easy to do the majority of the things that presenters do -- in particular, create pie charts, bar charts, and other pretty-but-readable stuff. If you want to create good looking charts or presentations in a hurry, Keynote will almost certainly serve your needs.Plus, it's easy to pick up. My learning curve _might_ have been five minutes. (Though, to be fair, I've reviewed hundreds of software applications for computer magazines, and I'm a fast learner. So give yourself ten minutes, instead, before you pick up the adequate but not-overwhelming printed manual.)Keynote is a good example of technology helping rather than getting in the way. Except you'll probably spend more than a couple of minutes playing with the really impressive set of slide transitions. I never need such things, but I had fun with them anyway.But don't expect perfection. Keynote is a great version 1.0, but it's definitely 1.0. So far, I've found two glaring omissions: it doesn't export presentations to HTML (PDF, Quicktime and PowerPoint yes... HTML no). And there's no way to create a follow-me arrow, as in Visio. Creating a process chart, with this-leads-to-that, or an organization chart, can be an exercise in frustration.I'm sure that later versions will address these limitations, however. Overall, I'm very pleased with the software."
6941,1,"If you own a Mac, you're foolish to not invest in 2 fixit apps, TTP and DiskWarrior (DW's unfortunately not yet available for Intel Macs, but should be, soon). TTP does everything you need to do, and does it reliably. It also has an ""eDrive"" feature, a bootable 2nd volume on your drive containing what you need to fix things (necessary because a volume can't fix itself), which is immediately available when you need it. (DW ""only"" rebuilds the directory, but that is arguably the most important single thing which sometimes needs fixing. The reason you should have both utilities is that sometimes one of them can fix the directory when the other can't, since they use different approaches. Actually, a Mac owner already owns a fixit utility packaged with the OS, DiskUtility. While the weakest of the three, it, too, is sometimes useful for repair.)I can't agree with the criticism I've read in the other reviews. If the version of TTP is appropriate to the version of the Mac OS, TTP works as advertised. If the user has inadvertantly used the wrong version, then it's like putting diesel fuel into a gasoline engine. The blame for that mistake can hardly be laid on Micromat's doorstep. I've used TechTool on many different Macs since its beginnings, and it has never caused me a single problem, but it has averted or corrected a number of them."
90797,1,Microsoft Publisher 2007 is a fantastic tool. I use it to create flyers for my business. It is easy to navigate and understand if you have had any experience with other publisher formats. I only wish Microsoft would have incorparated it into their Office Home and Student 2007 software. It is a little pricy but still a good return on investment.
13469,0,"This is my third year using the State version of TurboTax and my fifth year with the Federal version. If you made a big gulp and installed the federal version inspite of the product activation scheme then I would get the state version also. If you bought the deluxe federal version the state version is free after rebate.I have to give the state version three stars because it lacks a lot of the help features that come with the federal version of the program. For example, in Massachusetts you have to break down interest and dividends for inclusion into various tax brackets (it's worse than the federal form) but TurboTax gives very little help in figuring out what goes where. (May be other state versions are more helpful). Still, it is a lot better than the pencil and paper method. If you can take the product activation scheme then this is worth using."

94231,1,As an owner of versions 3 &amp; 4 my first two attempts with the new title version 5.0 was unsuccessful because of the difficulty I had establishing copy speed of my two cdrw's resulting in ruining two discs. The buttons are pretty but this version is not as user friendly (simple) to use. I still do not know how to format a disc for backup purposes as I did in the past.
91649,0,"I have used Paperport for the past 3 or 4 versions. Paperport 11 is improved but still the slowest application on my hard drive.In particular displaying thumbnails of files in a folder seems to take from a minute to several minutes to accomplish.Also scanning with my Epson 3170 scanner appears to be problematic; whenever I hit the scan button and do not wait until the scanner's light stops flashing, I will get an error. I then cancel out the scanning dialog and start over. Usually I will be granted a scan.Overall, I like the program to help organize all my important documents, but I do not like the fact that almost every operation is slow.By the way my computer should not be the problem; I'm running a new AMD 64 x 2 4400+ processor with 2 GB of RAM. Every other program I have is zippy except for Paperport 11."
4861,1,"After reading several of the reviews about Norton's Internet Security 2004 software on Amazon, I was a nervous installing it on my computer. I received a free 60-day trial when I bought a Linksys wireless router to use with my new cable modem (so my wife could have access to the internet on her laptop), so I figured I'd try it out and pray for the best. My computer is old. It's been rebuilt a couple times from it's original 1995 Compaq Presario configuration. I currently run Windows 2000, and all the other stuff (processor speed, memory, hard drive size, etc.) on my system is probably in-line with a computer bought back in 2001. I already had Norton Anti-virus, but this software added a much needed firewall (since I'm on the internet now 24/7), along with anti-spam and anti-ad pop-ups/banners programs (I'm so happy to get rid of those annoying ads!!!). It took less than 15 minutes to install Norton Internet Security 2004 and I have not had any problems with it (other than a few minor configuration issues). My computer has not slowed down at all and the interface for the software is ultra user-friendly. I would recommend this software to my family and friends. Norton is awesome!"
89231,0,"When I purchased Parallels I was not aware that you needed a full purchase of Windows also. All I have is what came with my computer, therefore, I cannot use Paralles! I haven't even taken it out of the box. After the purchase of an Apple, warranty, Parallels, I'm broke. Plus, I would have never purchased knowing what I know now. Expensive just to run Windows on a Mac. The reason I went to a Mac is its better. I'm not putting the product down, from what I hear and read its great."

51250,0,"The maps are OK, they scanned the paper maps and that it's about it, no enhancements, no grid correction. If you want to print maps that share two UTM quadrants you will end up with a messy UTM grid. The other problems with printing are scale and resolution. You can print only one page at the time, there is no such thing like select the area that you want to print and the scale and let the software do the page distribution on a given page size. When you want to print a map the software will &quot;suggest&quot; a scale, that scale is really something, no 1:24000, no 1:25000 is more like printing a picture that a map, however you can choose a custom scale and set to 1:24000 but then the printing quality is gone. The font on the printed map borders can not be selected and scale with the map, that means you will end up with a bigger font on a 1:24000 map than on a 1:25000 map."
63909,1,"If you like year one, you will love year two and beyond. If you have a job, a couple of kids, a mortgage.... you probably have them this year too!

94696,2,"I'm using the Mac-Version of Britannica Ult. Reference Suite 2005. I'm using it on my PowerBook with 1.25 GHz and 512 MB Ram.Benefits: it contains the authoritative content of the Britannica. That's fine. 2 stars for that.BUT: The app just SUCKS, everything is LAME. The startup, the search features, the tools, EVERYTHING. It's annoying to use it. The Britannica team seems to trust totally on the content, but that's a failure, cause I will not by a product of them again till I read the announcement: ""Britannica has rebuilt its Suite from the ground up in Cocoa, with focus on SPEED.""The Atlas has absolutely NO features, it isn't interactive at all, just a collection of images you surf through. You can view the world, each continent and each land, but THAT'S IT. If you click in a province of Italy e.g., you will get to the article. That's boring. I've heard in Encarta you can get much more details, as you can see the main streets of many cities. Here you don't even see whole provinces in detail!The Britannica ""ultimate"" reference edition is a slow tool which connects to a text database with a few pics and movies. It is NOT an interactive, useful application.If it isn't possible to create an application fast AND convenient, then I would prefer a snappy, sleek little Tool to fly through the articles, really fast and not bloated. That's more important than any features. Actually the built-in features like mindmapper and notices are so ugly and lame, that I won't ever use them.Fine content, but the app makes it very hard to reach."
8908,1,"This is soooooo fun and beautifull and all the princesses! No problem at all with my computer in installing and the voices are beautifull and clear. I guess the sound in the other reviewer's computer must have had a problem. This is the BEST fashion cd rom with the plus of having the princesses in it that I have seen. My daughter is 4 and can play with it. But its a discovery type game, ie you find out how everything works as you get more familiar with it. In the beginning things seem not to be working but with time you see that OH, now I have to drag and click not just click, or OH here you have to click on the icon first and then on the picture for it to do what you want! Have patience and you will become an expert princess! Very cheap for the amount of stuff you can do with it, also grows with the child. For young ones mom should play with it BEFORE the child to avoid initial frustration so you can explain some of the quirks to her first. Happy princessing this is a dream!"

12452,1,"For a Microsoft first release this not bad as far the operation itself goes, however (and there is always howevers with MS) I would recommend that you check your hardware and peripherals for upgraded drivers to XP first before I install it. A lot of older equipment will have problems, such as might not work, and if they are very old they may not even have updated drivers available. I found my DVD, canner and scanner as well my Zip drive were all unrecognized. So check the report that XP gives you before you upgrade. I know my brother had problems with both his sound and video card so he had to upgrade. I do like this a lot better than ME. Its design is smoother running and loads quicker and I don't see any conflicts so far between XP and other software packages. Also the I.E. 6 is very sharp and operates a little more smoothly with XP than I.E. 5.5 did with ME, at least that was my experience with ME, a lot of freezeups. One other thing I would recommend, when you download to XP give yourself time roam around and get used to it. This OS is a lot different as far as organization and setup goes from all other windows setups, but like I said its more commonsense I think and more visually appealing, you should enjoy the change. I don't know about the waiting for price drop, remember Win 98 stayed this price for quite some time and ME and 2000 didn't really drop until they got close to XP, so I wouldn't let price scare me off it could be a long wait. But if you are happy with your current OS and don't feel a need to upgrade right away then why not give it a shot and wait. Hope this helps and enjoy!"

67023,0,"The bad news is, you have to download a patch right off the bat from Intervideo's web site. They do not make it easy, the patch is at the bottom of the page of FAQs, so they make you hunt for it. I am running EN8800s in SLI, and in order to use the hardware acceleration I had to pay AGAIN to Nvidea and download their PureVideo program. So the total damages to watch DVD's was over $100, seems a little steep. For the price of the WinDVD, they should have include everything you need in the box. (Or else Nvidea should have included the necessary DVD program with their product.) Also, the loading time for WinDVD 8 seems extreme, maybe I am spoiled, but when almost all other programs are ready for use immediately, the wait for WinDVD 8 seems way too long, but using SLI may have something to do with the wait, I haven't tried it in a single video card machine.That said, using the hardware acceleration, the picture is PERFECT. You can see a difference compared to the software only, especially during action scenes. In fairness to Intervideo, I don't know if buying their competitors product would have been any better, and I am quite happy with the final picture outcome."
14506,2,"Not only do we continue to buy this overpriced software, but it continues to explode for no adequately explored reason, as well.As long as there was no actual choice, if one had to create Word files, then at least it made sense to use MS Office.However, now there is no reason to continue with the money flushing. StarOffice is a great deal cheaper, works generally the same way, reads and creates Word Excel and PowerPoint files, and is all in all an entirely adequate product.And yes, StarOffice runs on Windows too."
70161,1,"I am a network engineer with umteen years of experience, the upgrade from 2003 to 2007 had to be the most difficult migration of my career. The exchange part does work, I suggest getting all new 64 bit hardware, with Raid 10, don't use raid 5 and your old server. The anti-spam software leaves MUCH MUCH to be desired, it is crazy hard to master the power shell, and you will be pulling your hair out trying to figure out if you must don't know the right command, or why the powershell is not remembering your whitelist. Basically, forget about a whitelist, it doesnt exist in Exchange 2007 anti-spam software. Ridiculous you say? Exactly. In the powershell, it only remembers 1 email name for the whitelist, and 1 domain. (I am not kidding). After hours and hours of research I figured out I needed to use the client side, using outlook if I wanted to whitelist more then 1 users. And, using outlook on the client side for the whitlist has a new host of problems. I would seriously WAIT for SP2 or SP3 even 4. The SCR feature works, but you must manually switch the database. That is all it really is meant for, database failover. OWA doesnt work out of the box, you must buy a certificate, and even then it doesnt work with IE7 most of the time. Ironically, it works with Firefox all the time, but IE7 some of the time. I rushed into using 2007 in hopes I could use it for deploying to multiple sites, really do your research and figure out what part is marketing, and what part actually works."
7378,2,"The ""feature"" that makes me sorry I bought Microsoft SBA is the ""Spotlight"" -- a bulleted list of text ads that appear on every major screen, and that download new content on every one of those screens, every time you open the program. These text versions of pop-ups slow the application even more than its already-glacial pace (it's a bigger memory hog than Photoshop or Dreamweaver). You have the option to remove this ""content"", but on only one of the five screens where it appears. It is beyond annoying -- it's as if you brought a box of cereal, and were forced to listen to a commercial every time you wanted to eat some of it.SBA has its good points - it does a decent job of small business accounting, and it's pretty to look at. The print and online documentation both lack very important basics, such as how to add a logo to an invoice; you have to go to the user community for those. But in my opinion, none of the benefits outweigh the continual, inescapable intrusion of all those ads."

My virus scans have detected many of the spyware and Trojan Horse files (iefeat, etc.) that others say theirs seems to be missing. In researching this, it seems many anti-virus softwares are hesitant to define spyware and adware as a being malicious.

I guess I'll be filing by paper this year.Features that used to be in the Deluxe version are now only in the Premier version, forcing an upgrade for another $ to complete my tax return.Import from Quicken has always been poor, I have never been able to import anything other than some basic information.Just make sure you consider all this when making a purchase.

Leslie's grandpa is the captain. LapTrap, their cowardly yellow laptop friend, is just uncovering more of some strange artifacts that are later revealed to be called CrypTiles. Then, a tsunami arises, sending Joni & Santiago to an island with an active volcano, Leslie & Owen to a strange CrypTile labyrinth, and the captain to...where?

You have to play each mini-game 12 times to get 12 CrypTiles, and then you have to use your CrypTiles to play some special, much longer games, ""The Fish within the Fish"" and ""The Faces within the Face"". This sounds tiresome, but the mini-games are awfully darn quick & easy, so playing them 12 times isn't too bad. This game is divided up into 3 sections - the land area, the sea area, and the last area. Once you are done with both land & sea with Joni & Santiago, you go to the last area with Leslie & Owen. Each section (besides the last one) has 2 mini-games (I think) that can be accessed by exploring the area. As I said, each must be played 12 times and the CrypTiles gained must be used to access ""The Fish/Faces within the Fish/Face"". (Fish is to sea, face is to land.) It might sound like major lack of variety, but don't worry - they're fun and don't bore easily. There's also a game you must play when getting into the land/sea areas. The last area is a bit different, as you do not collect CrypTiles. I'm not really going to tell you 'bout it, though, since I don't want to spoil the plot.It sounds lame, but this game made me feel friendlier with my two sisters, Russian Blue Witch (older) and Chocolate Dog (younger). I mean, just solving those problems together made us feel like pals (or at least I felt like pals with them).Here's some ratings on this CD-ROM's aspects. If you're low on time, don't read it. It's awfully long.-Graphics: 7/10. The graphics are indeed good. There's a little bit of a problem, though: inconsistency. Sometimes, solid-colored cartoons touch detailed-looking CrypTiles. Also, some of the images are recycled from ClueFinders 3rd Grade, others aren't. However, other than that, they're good. They've even got some CGI.-Gameplay: 8/10. Very fun in my opinion. Sometimes, it tires a little, and a bit more variety would be better, but the games are all very fun. Mostly, it's just clicking/dragging, but it's still a blast. The fractions-tube game would be better if it had a scrap pile to put fractions not in use, but most of the games are great the way they are.-Educational Value: 8/10. It teaches and practices all sorts of subjects. It is very well fit for 4th-5th Grade level. It covers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, geometry, science, geography, a bit of history, reading comphrehension/making paragraphs, alphabetizing, spelling and...am I forgetting anything?-Plot: 6 and a half/10. It's not my favorite, but it's good enough. One lame part at the end (not much of a spoiler): Joni lost her spare CrypTiles and supposedly can't prove the events that happened in the game. HEL-LO??? What about WITNESSES? You've got LOTS of WITNESSES! LOL Oh, and, I have to say, the ""Play Again/Quit"" screen at the end is slightly creepy to me - not a very good ending note.-Humor: 7/10. There's enough funniness at just the right times to liven up the semi-serious plot. They're not joking all the time - just at the right times. ""Salami?"" ""No! Tsunami!"" LOLMusic: 5/10. I really didn't like it. There was a lot of creepy-ish music. The music from the 3rd Grade game is much better.Appropriate-ness (Violence, etc.): I'd say about 10/10. It's a little creepy sometimes, but SERIOUSLY.Overall, I'd say this is a good ClueFinders game for 4th & 5th Graders. Very fun and quite educational! The 4th Grade ClueFinders is great, too! I haven't played much of ClueFinders 3rd Grade because when I was in 3rd Grade, I was a little afraid to get past Goo Falls because I thought I might fail, but what I have played is good. I have watched my older sister Russian Blue Witch play all of the different ClueFinders games. There's 3rd Grade (Mystery of Mathra), 4th Grade (Puzzle of Pyramid), 5th Grade (this one), 6th Grade (um...Plant Thingy XD), Math (um...Snow Thingy XD), Reading (Mystery of Amulet), & Search and Solve (er, the amusement park thing-a-ma-bob), as well as the bonus discs Mystery Mansion Arcade & Real World Adventure Kit. (I think the Mystery of Amulet bonus discs is really Reading. I could be wrong.) Of course, I've only played 3rd, 4th, & 5th Grade so far, as well as the bonus discs. I reccomend ClueFinders 5th Grade to 4th & 5th Graders. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""

66936,1,"I have used this product many times. Each time I learned something more. There are thousands of clipart so you can make greeting cards, photo projects, labels, stationery, signs, stickers, business cards and more. The graphics are exciting and beautiful with sharp, clear printing. Use this product every day and you will be enjoy making products."
41709,1,"I wanted to establish partitions for my new laptop to separate my OS, programs, files, etc. I wanted to do this not only to organize my hard drive, but also because my old laptop had a C:\, E:\ & F:\ I had to have the same configuration in order to migrate applications using PC Mover. The product allowed me to do this easily. The interface is very easy to understand and if I should want to dynamically change partition sizes or create a partition in the future I am confident I can do this without any problems."
77089,1,"I have a Garmin LMT 1450. Unfortunately there is not enough memory built into the GPS to hold these maps and the US, so I got the SD card. I installed it before I went on my trip to the UK/Ireland and the maps came up, no problemo. However, I ran into problems when I tested it again in London prior to driving the following week in Scotland. It would not synch with the satellites. I check for a solution online and found that I needed a clear view of the sky. I walked to a park and waited until the battery ran out without any luck.I then called Garmin UK support and was told that I had to clear all user data if I wanted the unit to work in Europe. And I would have to do that again when I went back to the US. This would cause the Garmin to find the local satellites. Unfortunately your home address and recently found locations are erased as well. This information is not sent with the maps and should be!Here is the procedure on my unit, look at your manual under Erase User Data to find out your secret way to reset the Garmin to the local satellites:1. Turn off your Nuvi.2. Hold your finger on the lower right corner of the Nuvi screen while turning on the Nuvi. Keep your screen finger pressed until the pop up window appears. May take 30 seconds, so be patient with that finger. You will be prompted whether do you really want to erase all user data, or asked if do you really want to start up in maintenance mode.3. Press ""Yes"" to clear all user data.I did that and when the unit came back on it synched up in about 10 minutes or so. After that it behaved as it did in the US, usually ready almost immediately.So how was the map experience? Very, very good. Literally all roads but one came up and that was a fairly new 20 mile section of expressway in Ireland. It almost always took us the fast way. The arrival time estimates were always too optimistic as the posted speeds on those small roads in Scotland and Ireland were begging for a head on accident. Often the speed limit was 60 mph on a two way road with blind turns, overgrown stone walls on both sides and farm tractors zipping your way.Roundabout directions were very good with a lot of advance notice. ""Roundabout in one half mile."" Sometimes a roundabout had a blocked road that had never been finished and you had to guess whether to count it when it told you to, ""Enter roundabout and take third exit.""A couple of tips for roundabouts.1. Most large roundabouts have two lanes going in. If the unit tells you to take the second or third exit, it is usually better to be in the right lane, because the left lane is often dedicated to the first exit.2. It is pretty reliable to count the exits to get the right one using the Garmin. But a good double check is to glance at your unit (or ask your copilot) and see what road you should be taking next as you exit the roundabout. The roundabouts are incredibly well signed with very clear arrows. Just look for the arrow going towards the road the Garmin tells you to be on, count the exits and take the one leading to your next road. Piece of cake even in large cities.We drove in Edinburg, Dublin, Galway, etc. and felt comfortable that the unit worked well and the maps were almost 100% correct.We found one major error as the unit could not find Bunratty, a popular little town in Ireland. (Best Irish coffee ever at the Bunratty Hotel! and try the Lamb Stew at Durty Nelly's pub across the street from the Castle.)Also, I did not find how to enter latitude/longitude coordinates into our system. I suggest you figure that out because many small hotels or B&Bs; don't have addresses you can enter. Often they use a nearby town and perhaps a road. Or their websites will list the lat/long.Overall these maps greatly reduced our stress level about driving in the UK."
28086,1,I upgraded from a much earlier version. This one runs just fine on my new iMac with Leopard. It is easy to use and powerful. I am getting ready to upgrade again to the CS3 version soon.
70951,1,"I played the origional ""incredible machines"" games when they first came out and I was hoping to find something close in challenge and gameplay. This game is even better. The physics are amazing and this is a great thinking game for kids.It is easy to install, but make sure you have enough RAM!If you are unsure, they have a demo that you can download. If you like it, come back here to buy because this is the ENGLISH version.Go! Try it and come back!"
61498,1,"This is an excellent sermon. These are not a waste of money. They are all very long. I think 45-60 minutes, though they are all a little different. So, you can listen to them again and again without getting bored, within reason. Of course I shuffle which ones I listen to. Anyway, as far as the content of this particular sermon, this one is no doubt the best one I have so far. I have 5. It is very serious and thorough. It covers how life is wasted and how precious time is, and so is about much more than simply making the most of each day. It makes the hearer re-consider the entire course of his life, as well."
71378,1,"The information is very useful, just the e-book information itself is extremely valuable. The other ""reviewer"" said that he did not find it useful, and that there was no flexibitliy. However, I disagree, you can make any information as flexible as you choose by simply ""exporting"" the data. Many forms here, give you all the legal basics that I simply could not find on line (that is without having to pay for it). There is very little information that you can actually obtain for free anymore, and if you find it, you've probably invested hours upon hours of time that could be better spent running your business. I'm thrilled with my Legal Business Pro, now I can do all the work myself, and finetune it as I see fit (by simply exporting the finished document). And for a business owner that does business in several states, it has you covered, as you simply select which state(s) and it extracts the information relevant to you needs. A great resource, for those who would rather do their own work than shell out cash every time they need a simple legal form drafted."
54932,1,"Have been using fully licensed and purchased Turbo Tax for many years. I also use Quicken Home and Business and it integrates seamlessly. Intuit is one of the best developers of business software out there. This product makes doing one's taxes so easy.I completely do not understand anyone complaining about an Activation process. The only reason an activation process would be disturbing is if you are a thief and are trying to steal the software - otherwise, its good business. Anyone who would prefer Intuit to go out of business - well guess who is Intuit's biggest competitor - Microsoft. Take your pick folks. Pay for the software or watch all the little guys get swallowed up. So, word to the wise - FBI should grab everyone's name who complained about activation codes because they're likely not paying for their software and have plenty of other illegal installations on their machines. Pehaps these guys aren't paying their taxes either now that they can't get their free TurboTax."
93322,1,"We bought this game for our 5 year-old son. It took a few minutes for him to get the hang of it, but now he loves it. At first, he was a bit flustrated because there are some many options that he felt overwealmed. After one day of play, he loved it. He play's it often and we have even caught our ""very cool"" 8 year-old daughter joining in. This is every bit as cute as the show and there are so many games that your little one will not get bored. Also, set up is easy and it runs great on our new computer and the latest windows version."

I think this is a wonderful piece of software that is far superior to the rest on the market. It's exceptionally easy to use, and the look of the plan is great.I can't claim, as of yet, that I've used a generated business plan to seek VC funding but I'm certain that I won't be rejected on the merits of the &quot;look&quot; of the document. I guess that puts all the weight on my shoulders to write good content. But then again that's the point isn't it!"

21445,1,"Now we can truly virtualize as many Operating Systems (OSs) as we like on a modern rig, all with full networking capabilities that run anywhere between 100% and 75% of the speed as if the OS was actually hard installed on the system. However when we are talking systems with above 512 MB of RAM and better than 2.0 Ghz, you are never going to go with a single OS machine or a multiboot/dualboot when you have seen VMware in action. I have booted Windows XP (you can boot Win 3.1, Win 2K also if you want), Linux Slackware (one of the unsupported Linux distros that works and I don't see why all Linux versions should work), FreeBSD6 (6 is unsupported but works), Solaris 10 (no problem) and I have personally seen the Apple MAC OS X Tiger running on it, but running OSx86 is illegal. However I have seen it on VMware on a PC. You can load all this on a notebook and have all of these OSs running on it at the same time, even full screen mode and it just looks so unreal, the kind of stuff that moves your soul when you see OSx86 with networking running on a PC Laptop. The fact you can toggle between the OSs without needing to boot only one OS and the presence of OSx86 makes this an absolute must. A few things need to be noted though. Sometimes you should use VIRTUAL IDE Virtual HDDs instead of SCCIs in VMware virtual hardware setup. In VMWARE BIOS (F2) you sometimes must change large disk access mode to OTHER rather than DOS, especially for Linux systems. If you can't get proper screen resolutions sizes, install VMware Tools from VMware, right click on OSs tab, ""Install VMware Tools"" and this mounts the tools inside the OSs in the /cdrom drive. Copy it and install it and you should have all the resolutions you need. Anyway what are you waiting for? This is crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Note: Kernel compiling is for advanced Linux users and if you are going to be opening up the Kernel then SuSE is not for you. Advanced users use Slackware or something more professional than SuSE or else you will hit problems. I have used SuSE, great for newbies, not for expert work. VMware does support Linux. There are dozens of VMware channels on IRC. 24/7 support and their support website is good."

We own the &quot;Dig &amp; Rig&quot; play set and it works great, but this software is developed by a different company and they figured out how to make XP an unstable environment. The graphics and games are very well done, but I think the instability is too much for this adult let alone a child."

The new Simple Start version is meant to make it very easy for the small business owner to get started in everyday accounting (probably more like bookkeeping to purists).

OneNote is an interesting program which is new to me but it's pretty cool.Everyones PC is different in some way so a good performing PC should be able to utilize the full experience smoothly."
23503,1,"I have used Symantec and McAfee. I shopped and compared anti-virus products after Symantec brought my machine to a halt. After lots of calls, unsuccessful un-installs, the only way to solve the Symantec problems was to get rid of it and do a clean Windows XP install - re-format the hard drive. Never again Symantec!After a lot of reviews I chose BitDefender. I had one glitch in installation, but talking to a REAL LIVE TECH SUPPORT PERSON (amazing!) on the phone solved that.It has been fine. If it is slower than any other programs, I don't notice it on downloads and the scans are done nightly while I sleep.Appears to be effective, simple and stable."
76801,1,"The Garmin Italy map made driving in Tuscany easy. It is much better than the Michelin map which we also had with us. Michelin doesn't have all the small roads marked that we used as we drove throughout Tuscany. Having the Garmin was so reassuring because we knew right away if we made a wrong turn - recalculating! We found the small hill towns to be tricky, with many little winding roads coming into one intersection. The Garmin was essential here and always got us where we wanted to go. We used it many times to locate specific hotels and restaurants too. I was very impressed with this product and highly recommend it for anyone planning a trip."
1950,1,"No one likes to have to upgrade an operating system. I went from Win 95 to Win 98 to take advantage of a larger hard drive without having to cut it into smaller 2 GB drives. And to utilize my cable modem via USB, I needed to upgrade to ME.There are a lot of horror stories out there about upgrades. These horror stories worried me--so much so that I started with a blank drive when I went from 95 to 98. But this time, I decided to do the upgrade on top of my system and it went without a hitch.As with any upgrade, clean-up your hard drive (uninstalling unwanted or unnecessary programs and fies) and back up everything. Archive your Outlook address book and emails (choose the archive option in email options and save the .pst file). Worst case scenario is that you have to format your hard drive and start over again. But in this case, I was pleasantly surprised how easy and painless the upgrade went."
38238,1,"I've used the Timbuktu line for quite a few years now and have had good success overall. I recommend it highly for people who want remote control on local area networks. What truly stands out with this product is that it runs on all Windows computers (95 and above), as well as MacOS computers. Timbuktu 2000 brings some nice features for Windows platform computers. I've seen a few small quirks here and there on Win 2000, but nothing major. Overall, a good product!"
83012,1,"Most authors employ both a creative and an analytical process in structuring a final story--one to write with and one to edit with. Dramatica Pro is the perfect tool to guide you through both processes. Be aware, however, that the program makes you work. Hard. When used correctly, Dramatica pushes you into forming characters with depth; you'll never hear a reader say ""he/she would never do or say that."" Dramatica forces you to focus on developing a story rich with plot tension and thematic development; there will be no ""holes"" to trip you up. Dramatica's main desktop is the gateway for all story-building. Take the time to explore each tile and the wealth of information at your fingertips. Start with the query system and answer each question. You'll be surprised at how much you don't know about the story in your mind when you begin and how much you do know when you're finished. If, like me, you are a ""seat of the pants"" writer, don't pass on this superb advisor assuming you don't need it. Write your story, input the information into the appropriate tiles and find out how much you've missed that would make your story much, much stronger.Caveat: if you are looking for a program that will write your story for you, this is not it. If you're looking for a program that will correct poor prose, poor spelling, bad dialogue, point of view errors, etc--this is not the program for you. If you want a writing partner that will nag you into producing a strong plot structure, a well developed theme, and a rock solid foundation, then Dramatica is your choice.The program is not easy, but it is ""user friendly."" If you spend some time understanding the terminology and the plethora of tools available to keep you focused on the story you want to tell, Dramatica Pro will repay you with stories others will want to read/watch."
45096,0,"I bought this program for my 3 year old neice. She loved it. The content is great. One problem is that the program requires a double-click for many actions. Teaching a 3 year old that they need to double-click isn't easy. Another problem is that the 3rd program in the set only runs on OS 9, not OS X. It's ridiculous that a program sold today will only run on a 5 year old operating system."

48103,1,"The Rosetta Stone Explorers are intuitive and fantastic! They give 22 lessons of the 92 lessons in Level 1. Explorers are just that: EXPLORERS. This program allows you a trial run of the full program, only the printed script from the full program is missing. The Explorer materials take you to the level of about 3 months of High School language classes. The Level 1 is approximately equal to 2 years of High School or 1 year of University, and level 2 adds 2 more years or High School or 1 more year of University language. This is a real bargain compared to tuition!I've done the Indonesian Explorer, I have given Spanish to a 62-year-old friend, Japanese to a 9-year-old whose grandfather speaks Japanese, and Portuguese to a 10-year-old whose father speaks Portuguese. My Level 1 Indonesian should be here in a couple of days, my older friend is picking up on Spanish much more rapidly than he did with Pimsleur, and the kid's parents report that they are &quot;hogging the computer&quot; to play their &quot;game&quot;. If they stick with it over the Summer break, the parents have the option of ordering the full program at a discount exceeding the Explorer purchase price when they buy Level 1 or Levels 1 &amp; 2.The only down-side is: Fairfield Language Technologies has discountinued the Explorer (and the PowerPac and the Traveler) series. There will be no more after what is avialable now is sold - unless popular demand changes their minds."

Norton Personal firewall also came up wanting.Hands down, Zone Alarm is the best personal firewall software package available.Note, if you share directories on your network, or have your PCs organized in a workgroup (or domain), you will have to tweak the settings to allow your PC to respond to netbios packets on your network. This is a good thing, considering I found that I am constantly probed from the internet by script kiddies looking for easy targets.Highly recommended."

I spoke with two different Amazon reps regarding the misleading description, and this product was supposed to have been removed. The first rep said they must have pulled the incorrect product from the shelf when fulfilling the order, the second rep said the product would be removed. It's still there. Don't waste your money unless you are content with the old, original version of the game."

55960,1,"I decided I HAD to have Dreamweaver 4 after trying the Dreamweaver 3 demo software. And I think there is a big improvement over version 3. A lot of tweaks, here and there, that I couldn't live without!I love the easy Flash text and Flash buttons, how wonderfully Dreamweaver integrates with Fireworks (and if you download the extension, you can import ImageReady HTML as well). I know I haven't even scratched the surface of this wonderful program, but it is head and shoulders above any other WYSIWYG program I've used. And such wonderful resources! Plenty of Dreamweaver extensions to download, plenty of fun new things you can get it to do!I know how to do a little HTML, so I appreciate how I can &quot;look under the hood&quot; at my code with BBEdit, or with Dreamweaver's &quot;split view&quot; that shows both WYSIWYG, and code windows. So, even if you don't like to be far from the code, you can still find a lot to like about Dreamweaver.All I know is that because of the program, my web pages have a more polished appearance, and web authoring is easier and more seamless. The program runs fine on my little iMac, with OS 8.6. Though - if you want to run Dreamweaver *and* Fireworks/Photoshop at the same time, stock up on RAM! RAM is always a good thing."
3493,0,"I was lucky in that I was able to obtain this from my local library. So, for free, its ok. Had I paid for it, I'd have gone back and asked for a refund.This program is good in that it gives you a good basis of vocabulary. The bad thing is, it doesn't really seem to give it in any helpful context.The vocabulary seems to be just given in successive recitation without any basis for reference. For example, you might hear ""marhaban"", but because they don't tell you the meaning of ""marhaban"", it doesn't really mean much other that you're hearing the word. Ok, so now you've heard the word ""marhaban"". So what, if you don't know the meaning, its kind of useless. And that's what this whole thing seems to be is just one long stream of vocabulary. One word after another.So I guess I'd have a hard time recommending this course. I like to be able to hear something and be given a meaning. So if I heard ""marhaban-Hello or welcome"". Then it would be useful. But I like to listen to stuff in my car. I can't very well do that if I'm having to sit there with a book and read along...Sorry, but I'd recommend something else before I'd recommend this. Its fine if you already have a solid basis of vocabulary, but worthless if you're a beginner."
11875,1,"For the price that MS is charging for this product it is well worth it. The media converter is very useful to convert all my media into smaller files that can be played in my jukebox.

It was also cheaper...yet I didn't feel like I got cheated.There are only two disks and if you want more after the basics, I don't think there is much out there...I would like to see a Disk 3 and maybe even 4....but for now I am happy with my 40 lessons.....I am hopeful that I sound like a native would sound...or at least will be understood."

Upon noticing that he is from Seattle(Microsoft's hometown), I decided to look at his other reviews. According to Mr. Winters, he purchases and extensively uses each version of WordPerfect Office, even after saying that each one is worthless. He also seems to have glowing complements for Microsoft products. This tends to make me think that Mr. Winters is a paid or voluntary basher.In my experience as a CPA, I have used both WordPerfect and MS Office on a day-to-day basis, both word processing and spreadsheets, and I have found that WordPerfect makes a product with many innovations that are then copied a year later by Microsoft Office. I guess they save a lot on R & D this way. Also, WP is much more intuitive for new users. I have had some clients that start on MS Office, only to give up due to its complexity and lack of explanations. I suggested WP to them, and they found that it was easy to follow. The only time that I will use MS Office is when I am supervising a client at their office, while I am complaining about it."

64915,1,"Integration of Organizer and Editor in Elements 3 provide a seamless dance between thumbnail organization and the deep power of Photoshop's image modifications for enhancements. Several innovative factors elevate Elements 3 into a class of its own.The power of the Organizer is in reaching across all your photos, displaying them as thumbnails, and organizing them in Tags (People, Places, Events) and Collections (roll your own). For the avid digital photographer, who collects several hundred to a thousand photos per shoot, the organizer is the first step in the workflow. When I pull the CF card from the camera and plug it into a USB port, the organizer automatically prepares to scan all photos to my hard drive. At a glance, I can decide which ones are prize winners, segregate them into collections, then enhance or modify them in the Editor. Imagine the power of this facility when you have 5000 or 10,000 images already processed. The smooth, seamless dance between Organizer and Editor really eases workflow!While the Organizer may be icing, the Editor is cake! Take a look under the hood of Elements 3 - you find digital imaging capabilities of Photoshop. In a one click process you can decide to do Quick Fix, which provides the intermediate user with slider Levels balance. A touch of Highlights or Shadows, a slight MidTone Contrast, perhaps a bit of Saturation, and some Unsharp Masking will do absolute wonders for JPEGs.The Editor also handles RAW files so familiar to the advanced user - files the camera sees and stores on the CF card without white balance or other manufacturer modifications. Some color balance can be done in RAW using 16-bit mode, but must be saved in 8-bit for Elements 3 to continue processing.Not every dawn or dusk landscape picture you shoot will be a carefully balanced tripod shot over several f stops. When you need curves, blend modes, and layer masking, Standard Edit becomes your workflow. These intermediate-to-advanced steps call on elements of Photoshop CS, the most likely underlying graphics enhancement engine. With a bit of delicate maneuvering, I was able to recover an early morning shot of Totem Poles at Monument Valley. Unfortunately, the sky was blown out because the camera was on spot meter and pointed at a butte below the horizon. From an initial mess, a gorgeous photograph emerged!Elements 3 is far less expensive than Photoshop CS or CS Suite, its big brother. Integration of Organizer and Editor is smoother than file browser usage in CS. Elements 3 is not the universal panacea: one cannot perform all Actions, there is no user's manual, and in some cases such as Windows XP SP2, the user may not be able to access the Help package. I have not found Adobe's workaround to be particularly illuminating.Nevertheless, for the dollars, Elements 3 is indeed a real treasure. The Organizer is intuitive - in visual balance. As to the Editor - at Quick Fix level, the digital photographer moves to an intermediate workflow stage. At Standard Edit level, he or she jumps into the stratosphere of advanced Photoshop enhancement, and, in some cases, recovery. Diligent photographers know there are some shots you can't retake.I write, photograph, and speak. Elements 3 is my cost-effective, one-stop shop for thumbnails, image enhancements, creating PDF slideshows, and matting photographs.Richard Lynch's Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 3, with its suite of some 60 tools, can, in some cases, extend Elements 3 beyond typical usage of CS. Elements 3 software and Hidden Power tutorials and software make a very powerful combination!"
73539,1,"I think this product is great, many options for different learning styles. The full immersion method, (all Spanish lessons, no English) help you to really learn the vocabulary. Also the books that are included are a great way to review when you can't be near the computer. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested in learning a new language. After I've mastered Spanish and finished this series, I'm considering a third language and will definitely use one of the other Rosetta Stone programs to do so!"
75832,1,"When I decided to add digital and MIDI recording facilities to my wired together mish-mash of electronic and acoustic instruments, it was a daunting task. Other than an old MIDI Express and a Mackie mixer, most of what I owned was hopelessly prehistoric. Having decided to go about it in an organized fashion, I purchased a new computer (a Mac) and a fairly sophisticated 12-track analog to digital recorder (MOTU). Now it was time for the scary part. With my few remaining dollars a set about selecting the right software. All my research and trials led me to believe that Cubase was the package that provided what I wanted the way I wanted to use it. The availability of the (relatively) inexpensive SL version decided me, and I took the plunge.Much to my surprise and delight, I turned out to be right.Cubase is a fully featured package - including both audio and midi recording and playback facilities. In addition, it provides a mixer, timeline editor, and the ability to manage MIDI automation as well. It accepts the line of VST plug-in and virtual instrument add-ons that have made it a popular standard in the industry. As I discovered, it can interface directly with a host of peripheral equipment and instruments. My experience was that I hardly had to tell it that the equipment was there - it found everything and interfaced seamlessly.The test of a package as rich and complex as this is what happens when the user undertakes that first project. After a minimal amount of fiddling I decided to start out by transferring some of my old tapes to CD. Basically a simple process, but not one that is trivial. I set up a marker track and a stereo pair of input tracks and ran in the digital signal from the A-D - keeping levels to where I was getting the whole dynamic range while sampling at 48K. Going out I used UV-22 dithering, a tube distortion simulator, some dynamic processing, and a touch of reverb - all provided with the software. The results were excellent.To be honest, I later found that things work best if you maximize your buffers and your system memory. This wasn't a surprise but keep in mind that your disk drive speed is a critical factor, and that the more memory you have, the less often you need to write things out.These are the primary differences between Cubase SL and the SX version:1) In the SX version you can use the 'Truetape' technology uses the 32-bit float recording facility processes the sound a bit to emulate the performance of a professional analog tape recorder. A slightly warmer sound and digital normally produces. this can be emulated by post-processing as well, but it lacks the quality of high sampling.2) Both a Spectrum Analyzer and a Statistical Reporter are provided to help in project management and sound analysis.3) Cubase SX has good facilities for score layout and printing. This can be important for a midi-based composer. Less so for audio work.4) Cubase SL cannot import CD tracks, nor can it output to MP3 files.5) Cubase SL has only one automation mode, SX has 3.6) There are only 4 Master effects slots in Cubase SL (8 in SX).7) Channel/Mixer views can be customized in Cubase SX.8) Cubase SX has some additional plug-in facilities..There are some other differences, but these are the ones that are most likely to affect a buy decision. In retrospect I probably should have bought Cubase SX, since it better suits my long-range plans. But the SL version is most certainly not a toy, and I expect to get many miles out of it before finally upgrading to its bigger brother. The good news is that you can upgrade - for a fair price."
45358,1,"I gave Backyard Baseball 2003 a 5\5 stars grade because it's easy to play,you can pick your team and best of all there are made up backyard kids of different skill levels and to add to that there are kid versions of Major League Baseball players based on their actual skills. Each player has skills based on a scale from 1 to ten on batting,running ,pitching,and fielding.It's sad that there's no more Tony Gwynn,Mark McGwire,or Cal Ripken Jr but I understand because they're all retired. I think this game is better than High Heat 2003. I would rate HH2003 3/5 stars because it's hard to play and the Minor League players aren't even real. I highly recommend this game over HH2003. I also recommend this game for any sports fan!"

17563,1,"I decided to buy a monitor calibration tool because I do a lot of digital photos and they always look different on different computers. Sometimes I boost the colors only to find at work the colors are way too strong. It's frustrating, my 1 year old has ""orange"" hair. On some monitors it's brown, on others it's red. If this sounds like you (the color problem, not the orange haired baby) then this device is for you.This is a great entry level monitor calibration tool. The software is great and calibration is easy. Now images look the same on all my computers. And the best part is this device is the same device as the pro version. First, that means you're not getting a cheap device! Second, it means you can upgrade the software to pro version if you need to. This is why I selected this model. The eye-one is not upgradeable, and it's more expensive.Overall, I highly recommend this device."

There is even a virtual art gallery in which people can walk from room to room to visit your pictures. I created a couple of albums and made a big surprise to my friends. 3D-Album is a superior software, however, its system requirement is also higher than other album software. I can run my 3D-Album on my desktop computer, but not on my laptop, which does not have the required 3-D video card. Be sure to check your computer before buy the software."

I left Quicken and went to Microsoft Money, which I have been disapointed in ever since I did that. I was upset with quicken that long time customers (at least ten years) didn't get a better break on updated versions, then a couple of years ago maybe longer you changed your souce rograming so it would not read all the back up files from previous years. But I have learned my lesson, Microsoft Money is a waste of time and it does not have the bells and whistles that even Quicken Basic has. So I am back and happy, even without a more loyal support (break on cost of each years upgrade) I do not believe I will leave quicken again. It's good, does it's job, easy to learn,and in the end you will be happy."

67513,2,"Installing VPC on a 1.25 ghz Mac took me back to the days of the original Mac. No, not because of its easy-to-use elegance, but because VPC with XP Pro is slower than a Mac One with only a floppy drive.

I used the Windows version of Explorer on my broadband, and it took minutes to load a page that OS X loads in 3 seconds. In fact, no page fully loaded as no graphic ever appeared no matter how long I waited. Microsoft is supposed to deliver an update in 2004.

17052,1,"This software is focused on learning the rules of the game. Movement of different pieces and pawns is demonstrated through an assortment of arcade-type games. There are some decent books for learning chess for beginners, but learning through a computer game program makes it much easier and more fun.The program doesn't contain any instructions,so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what to do in the beginning. However, there is a symbol in the top right corner, clicking on which brings down the menu at which point navigating becomes a piece of cake.Just knowing the rules of the game enables one to play chess, but not exactly to win, so the second CD in this series (Learn to Play Chess 2) continues where the first one left off and goes into different tactics and strategies.The software is recommended for 8 year-old children and older - kids at heart may have fun learning chess with this program also."

80493,1,"For years now, people have been asking me about Linux - how hard is it to learn? When will it be easy enough for a &quot;non-techie&quot; to use? My answer, as of Red Hat 8+ is pretty much - now.If you use your PC to play on the web, &quot;do&quot; email, and use &quot;Office&quot;-type applications, it's probably easier these days doing so on Linux than on Windows XP. Go read the reviews of XP on this web site! The way they throw around acronyms: NTFS, ASPI, Microsoft &quot;Product Activation&quot; (&quot;Dear Microsoft, is it okay for me to use my computer now?&quot;)... Red Hat 9.0 installs with a fairly simple and intuitive wizard. You can (the easiest way) decide to run only Linux on your machine, or, if you have a bit more technical acumen, you can run both Linux and Windows on the same machine (switching between the two by rebooting).Some people are put off by the command-line interface in Linux (looks like DOS), but honestly, how often do you use DOS on your Windows system? Just like windows, everything can be done by clicking on an icon. Red Hat 9.0 ships with a graphical inteface called &quot;Bluecurve&quot; that looks and works VERY similarly to MS Windows - &quot;Start&quot; button, taskbar, icons on desktop - and puts everything near your fingertips.Red Hat also comes with Mozilla (a web browser very similar to Netscape), Evolution (an Outlook-like email client and personal scheduling program), OpenOffice.org (a MS Office XP replacement that reads and WRITES your MS Word, MS Excel, and MS Powerpoint documents), and about 1400 other games and applications. Other standouts include GnuCash, the Linux version of Quicken, the Tux Racer game - if you haven't played it yet, there's demos for all operating systems on it's web site - suitable for all ages, and KStars, the desktop planetarium, and did I mention about 1400 other games and applications?P.S. I'm guessing that with the recent Microsoft Blaster worm (and Slammer, and Nimda, and... ), the points about security risks in using Microsoft products - as opposed to Linux - is well made. *cough*"

30709,1,"The product lacks some of the features that I love with Pinnacle Studio 8. The DVD tools in Pinnacle Studio 8. Having used Pinnacle 7 &amp; * pretty extensively, I was curious about this product based on feedback I had received.authoring in MovieStudio (MS) is lacking, compared to the awesomeIf DVD &amp; VCD authoring and making basic videos is your thing, don't stop at MS. Use Pinnacle 8. For basic video editing and creating videos from pictures, it does not get much easier.However, once your imaginations starts to run wild, you are going to need something more power. I bought MS for that reason, realizing that I will still use Pinnacle 8 for DVD authoring.Pinnacle 7/8 provides only a single Video track. Splicing in video is possible, but much more painstaking than having multiple tracks (like most decent video editing tools.) MS has two tracks, but even on a single track you can overall (and blend) multiple video tracks! Pretty neat in concept.Cool features:* Chroma keyer: pretty much the big winner for me. This allows you to make solid color backgrounds (though not limited to backgrounds) to become transparent in a video (or image) that is to be overlaid unto another track. (Now you can be in a scene with out having ever been there.)* Much better collections of transitions and video filters out of the box then Pinnacle 8. (MS has 23 dissolve type transitions versus the single one in Pinnacle Studio 7/8). Although lacking 3-D object type transitions, the collection quality is on par with the Pinnacle Hollywood Effects add-on (non-pro version.)* While Pinnacle 8 is one of the easiest to use editors out there (that I have tried), I prefer the general layout of WS. There seems to be less wasted space.From the video editing side, I am hard pressed to see what Pinnacle can do that does not seem possible in WS. (I can definitely see the other way.)As for DVD/VCD authoring, I will not waste my time trying to do it in WS. Now, if you do not have Pinnacle 8, then what I might suggest you consider is to get MS plus a stand-alone DVD authoring kit. Both Pinnacle and Ulead have great packages.I am interested in seeing how well the codec in WS works. The rendering process in Pinnacle is among the slowest!!There's more, but I will stop here until I log more time in WS.Hope this is helpful."

550,1,"I got this many years ago, around the 5th grade. It was great fun making and printing garfield comics. They come out looking just like something out of the printed books.For obvious reasons, it is limited in what you can put into a comic strip. I remember having very few backgrounds to choose from. However, it was a simple drag-and-drop operation to place characters in many different poses. Speech and thought bubbles are also drag-and-drop, and you can put in whatever text you like.However, it is in desperate need of updating. Computers and programming languages have come a long way since this was created. If Scholastic were to hire ONE decent programmer for a few weeks/months, he/she could rewrite this and make it much better. (higher resolution, please?)Despite its limitations, it was a great program that I would recommend to any young garfield fan."
81265,0,"I purchased this software so that I could make quality business cards for my small business. I didn't want to go to a professional as I will only be printing low volume and thought I could save some $$$ as most pros in the business only give you reasonable rates in bulk quantities. The software installation went great with no hassles. Software runs well and takes you through steps to get you started. You can select either pre-installed templates or you can start a blank template and create your own from scratch which is the route I chose as I wanted mine to be unique. I saw some concerns from people asking if you can add your own pictures and the answer is yes, you can. Which I highly recommend if you are looking to get that professional and unique look to your cards. Otherwise, they give you ""clip art"" pictures that look very unprofessional and look like something printed off of Windows 98 sort of technology era. My only complaint about the software is once you do get into actually creating your cards it was confusing! I wanted a background color, do they have a background color button to click? No. I think if you are using a blank template it just wants you to use white and nothing more. I may be wrong but I am somewhat computer literate and for some reason I just couldn't figure it out. I finally wound up on google images typing ""black background"" saving the picture, uploading it into the document and cropping it to size to finally obtain my background color. Wasted time & effort as far as that was concerned. The entire layout is why the software only gets a 3. In my opinion it wasn't very self explanatory and fool proof. Inserting text could be done in different ways, via ""text box"" or creating text effects which seemed to reduce print quality so I just put the plain text. The text frame itself was a little confusing as it seemed to ""suggest"" that you were actually going to get ""Boxed in text"" on your card which thankfully the lines didn't show on final print or in print preview, but again gets you nervous. Centering, there was no center text, images, etc built in to the software, I didn't want everything off centered so I had to play around with it to get it as close to perfect as possible.In closing: If you are in a hurry to print some cards and don't want to spend much money but think you need a hand with software such as myself this might be right for you. With that being said, I think I would have done a little more research to see what else is on the market and what is rated better/more recommended, if I could do it all over again. Bottom line though, it did get the job done for me with some toying and poking around."

This isn't a bad thing, but I was mostly interested in speaking, so spelling wasn't important to me. Which is why getting the ""e"" with the right accent mark was such a pain. The method is not intuitive, and very time consuming for a typing task. The software does not accept the spelling otherwise.-It automatically changed my screensaver for me when it installed.On the other hand, the breadth of the lessons look good, and the design of the flow of the flash cards (repeating ones you got wrong more often) seems effective. Other people learn just fine with it. It was just a bit of a pain for me to use, and it doesn't fit my learning style."
80927,1,"I bought this product after doing my research: reading articles from computer experts and I can tell you it pay because it is the most cheap, complete and reliable computer protection software that is on the market. One reviewer mentioned that he had problems on his computer when he installed it: my advise to you is change that crap of computer that you have brother."
20181,1,I absolutely love this software program but will Microsoft never update and create a new version???Does anybody know anything about a newer version being in the works?
40437,0,I agree that this software does not provide a significant update to the previous year's version. It may be worth picking up just because it can be obtained for free with certain deals. I have the standard version on one machine and deluxe on the other. I don't believe that deluxe is a significant upgrade for most people either. The functionality of the planning software is unfortunately not that great.
85672,1,"I have used Roboform for years now. We have the program on both our desktop and laptop computers, and it is literally a godsend. Roboform generates, saves, and encrypts passwords as well as saving login webpages, so it functions both as a password and bookmark manager at the same time. Roboform users only have to remember ONE master password. Because of Roboform I no longer have to worry about sticky notes all over the place or forgetting a password to an important website. In addition to the above features, Roboform also keeps ""identities,"" which contain important info such as addresses, credit cards, driver's license, and much more. When I need to fill out a form to purchase an item or wish to enter info on a given website, all I have to do is go to my Identity, hit ""Fill,"" and Roboform does the rest. The company has even recently come out with full-featured portable versions, one of which comes complete with a USB thumb drive (the other is for use with U3 for your own USB drive), so you can take your Roboform program with you wherever you go. One really great thing about Roboform is the fact that you only have to pay for it once-none of this ""renew every year"" stuff like security suites (you do have to pay for extra licenses, but the price is reasonable). This is a great feature, but it seems like every time a company really cares about customer service as Roboform does, they get taken over by a giant company that COULD CARE LESS about it (Network Magic was a good example of this...bought out by Cisco-prices went up, service went down). Here's hoping Roboform remains an independent entity that will continue to take care of their customer base!"
34392,1,"I have the older version of MAD, which is not from the same company. Kudos for this version in every respect but one (and I may be in error).First, the old program suffers from a pain-in-the-(insert word here) interface, with no flexibility. This new version is all PDF. Transfer to your PDA and have fun!!!! It has some pretty good extras, like the covers of the paperbacks, which happened to be the only way we could get to see early stories like Starchie.I gave this 5 stars because of the ease of porting this from one PC to Mac to PDA. Now the big downer: As far as I can tell, there are no audio files. No Gall in the Family Fare? the audio parody of Archie Bunker? Aw, c'mon! Is that such a big deal? In the 7 CD version there are very few sound files, so it's not a space issue.Lastly, from a former printer, the register is not always great, as if they used poorly printed pages here and there. Print colors bleed. However, buy this one; it will not get any better. Find someone who has the old audio inserts or the original programs. Or, maybe I missed it, but dagnabit! I sure looked for them boogers. [Added] After more looking, they actually show the vinyl record and its reverse side, which is blank, but do not have the sound files. I don't really care about the extras like Spy animations that were not part of the original issues, especially when they leave out a key essential as a vocal version of a classic parody that WAS part of the originals.It's a great value. It's the most flexible of releases. Those who remember Broderbund's obscenely overly done protection will feel great relief. Put out a great product and people will buy it. Buy this."
19853,1,"The ninth of the Nancy Drew Mystery Series. This is my favorite game, so I'm gonna go nuts here. Things are graded A-F, just like school.The Crime: A +Nancy tries to take another vacation, this time by spending some time on Katie Firestone's whale watching boat in Snake Horse Harbor. The minute she arrives, plans change! Katie's boat has been vandalized. An orphan orca has shown up in the bay and there are different opinions as to what to do with it. Did Katie's big mouth get her in trouble?Suspects include fisherman Holt Scotto, cafe-owner Jenna Devlin, and rival whale watching tourguide Andy Jason.I'd never had a chance to learn anything about whales or the ocean and thought this was an endlessly cool premise.Puzzles: A +Nancy has to figure out everything from nautical terms to knots to Morse code. People give her tasks and quizzes. It can be as easy as making a sandwich or as hard as traveling underground tunnels and counting rocks.Gameplay: A +This game has it all. You can spend time out on the water in a kayak, eat a bowl of hearty chowder (or maybe a blueberry muffin) in the Hot Kettle Cafe, read about the local sea monster, build sand castles on a remote beach and dig for clams in the sand.The only thing missing is maybe romance. But you get to talk to Frank and Joe Hardy on the phone, so that's close enough. (I love those boys.)Time Changes: None.Voice Acting: A +In a word, perfect.Favorites -""Ah. Nuts."" Andy Jason""Next one'll be on the house, too."" Jenna Devlin""Vote for Holt!"" Holt ScottoMusic: A +I loved, loved, loved the music. The travel music was jaunty and perfectly fit the ambiance of the tiny seaside town. Especially cool was the little flute trill that occurred as you finished a puzzle.Graphics/Video: A +Getting better and better all the time. Bonus points for the animated sequences such as the whale watching tour.Technical: BI'm one of a few people who have had this problem, but no matter what I did, DDI wouldn't fully install on my computer. There was an error copying files and no matter what I did, it wouldn't fix it, even following HI's advice on the technical support board. Running the game from the disc rather than installing to my computer fixed the problem completely though.Overall, I think this one is the pinnacle of HI's goodness.If you love Nancy Drew, this one's for you. All-time favorite."
82123,1,"After finding my computer logging on to the net for no reason, I started looking around for a security program. I have always liked the programs made by Symantec. I bought Norton Security. After installation of the program I spent all the time answering questions from the progam. This got old real quick. It slow by surfing down to a crawl. I thought it was frozen up a rime or two. I purchased MacAfee 4.0 and it works super !! Set it and forget it. Its not a resource hog either. I love it."
61524,1,"If you used Mappoint 2002, you will be very comfortable with 2004 as the interface is identical. The biggest upgrade is the updates to the street maps themselves - although it is still not perfect. I live in a fast-growing suburb of Cincinnati, and Microsoft still missed a major huge street that was actually built in 2002!?! Oh well, it IS Microsoft after all, perfection should not be expected. At least you can't get a virus through this program! I think...THE GOOD: Other upgrades/changes include 2002 Census update data, and a whole bunch of new data fields that can be mapped thematically. These are consumer-oriented demographics, like households with internet access, computers, etc. There are a lot of statistics on avg. household expenditures (movies, clothing, furniture, food, etc.) Another nice upgrade is the ability to print maps almost edge-to-edge, getting rid of that stupid huge amount of white space at the bottom that took up 25% of your page real estate. There are more pushpins, and it is supposedly easier to import new pushpins (I have not tried that.)THE BAD: Mappoint 2002 had census data projections for 2005; this version has no projections for anything, 2002 is as current as you are going to get. No upgrades that I have been able to see with respect to territory mapping, they still have the same small (and ugly) selection of colors to shade your territories. Data is still mapped at the census tract level or higher - if you need block group level fuggedaboudit. Data import options seem to be unchanged as well.THE BOTTOM LINE: If Mappoint 2002 floated your boat, this is a required upgrade just to get updated roads. If the older version didn't have the flexibility or features, you probably should be looking at coughing up the dough for Arcview by ESRI. For a real comprehensive list of all the updates and changes, go to the Mappoint home page on Microsoft's web site."
36902,1,"Thank God for Wordpro. It totally blows away Word. IN this monopolized Microsoft world, it's just about impossible to not have WORD, so I have it. I use it to open attached files people send me. So I guess that makes WORD the Lingua Franca of word processors. But for writing, for creating flyers, ads, brochures, for my kids papers, posters, projects-- Wordpro is so much better, more powerful and easier to use.Some of the features I really like are the page and text formatting, and particularly, frames.The way Wordpo lets you build, manipulate, modify move frames makes it so easy to get just the look you want on your documents. I've used Wordpro put together great ads placed on 4th covers and inside covers of national magazines. That makes it more than just a word processor and that's why I originally got into it, in its earlier incarnation as Amipro.One great thing about it is the ability to save files in all kinds of other formats. Given the Microsoft world we operate in, Wordpro lets you save your files in various Word formats, so you easily share files with non-Wordpro users.I also like the tool bar, how powerful it is, how easy it is to modify and customize it.This is a great program. I hope IBM, the current owner will continue to support and develop it."
58279,1,"This is my favorite game of all time! It is great for girls who want a game that is challenging but not too difficult. It's wonderful for all ages, because it lets you adjust the level of difficulty. At times it can be difficult, but once you've solved the mystery, it's well worth the wait. Out of all the games I've ever played, this is the absolute best!"
4223,1,"I have the old version 2.03 and upgraded to the new version about 10 days ago. The new version is a huge upgrade. I was surprised to find that the new package contains almost all tools for my photo needs. It is no longer a picture show only software. Its photo organizer, printing, and editing features are as powerful as those professional tools. But what set this software apart to other products is still its 3d picture show tool. For these who want create movie-style picture shows, this is a must-have. Lots of new 3d styles and new controls are added in the new version. More selections. The DVD movie capture is integrated in the program."
59101,1,"I ordered this program because my previous computer came with an older version of it already installed for free. I used it all the time. When I purchased a new computer and it didn't have this program already on it, I was sorely disappointed and HAD to order it. I use it regularly to edit my photos and I love it! This particular version is even better than the old version I'd been using because it has so many features. I was very pleased when I received it! You can do just about anything to your photos... if you can figure out which tool to use in order to do it. It can be a little overwhelming because there are SO many options, but if you give yourself time to learn the program and familiarize yourself with the tools, it can be really useful. I highly recommend watching the tutorial it comes with at the start-up... very helpful."
50428,1,My 3 year old has been wanting a new Freddi Fish program as she loves the early ones. This one is great and she is totally mesmerized by it. My 18 year old nephew plays the game too and really likes it. It is a very fun program.
86813,1,"I teach special education classes in a jr. high school. This program (and the 5th Grade Adventure) is terrific for my students who are 6th to 8th graders reading at 3rd to 5th grade level. they have the same interest as every other Jr. High student, but not the ability to process at the same level. My students play this game all the time -- It is not patronizing to the students like a Reader Rabbit game would be. I have purchased several copies so that more than one student can play at a time. I HIGHLY reccommend it."

45668,1,"I am new to Linux in general, and thought I'd try another distro (especially since I can by an os for $40 or less with Linux vs. M$ at several hundred a pop). I have installed Red Hat and Mandrake on my DELL 2600 Inspiron laptop prior to trying Suse. As a user who got very use to point and click installs from M$, I have to say that the install is painless and fairly quick (for an os install). After clicking on a few prompts your os is on it's way to installation. I installed Suse on it's own hardrive, I did not try to dual boot it. Although I am a fan of the painless install and setup, I was not crazy about the layout, and themes. I then decided to replace Suse with Red Hat. Overall, Suse is a good os for a Linux newbie to use, the install/setup is not very difficult, but I do suggest to a user to read the manual/documentation before installing (especially if you are trying to dual boot w/ Windoze). The desktop is similar to M$' and a person with good PC skills should be able to get up and running almost immediately. However, I still like Red Hat's (despite it now becoming Fedora) desktop more. My suggestion is to try several Linux distributions, and see what suites your personal taste."

20070,1,"I bought it in 1999, 2000 and will again this year. It has been the easiest to use and I love how it mimics all the forms. In 1999 I tried one of the 'other' tax software. I been doing my taxes for years and this 'other' tax software left out things and was totally different than the tax forms I had just penciled in. I knew it was wrong and not easy to use. The same day I downloaded Taxcut and presto - the taxes I figured by hand was exactly what Taxcut figured and it even found some of my errors! What a tax tool!!!"
56633,1,"The virtues of this software have been clearly stated below. But I'd like to add one important point. It is the only Toddler education software that allows the child to play games before they are able to handle a mouse.All of the RR games can be played (at lower sophistication levels) by merely hitting any key on the keyboard. This is important for the under-2 crowd. We used RR as periodic ""edutaiment"" for our 7-month-old in bursts of 10-15 minutes. She loved the cause-effect interplay between striking the keys and the sounds and colours it ilicits, the animation etc...Surprising that no one else has a product nearly as good in this field.RR is the champ!"
46064,1,"It's a great program for music writing. With multiple ways to input, the most realistic sounding midi system to date, and the ability to save files as mp3s or other audio formats, it's definitely the best on the market. I'd recommend it to any aspiring or professional musicians."
35290,1,"I installed without any problem because I delete all of programs and reinstall win XP in my harddisk before installing the product. It's compatible with WIN S Pack 2 indeed. I think the problem of Norton software always happen because it easilly cause software conflict. NAV is great. Pretty much better than Mcafee, Panda and so on. The scanning is fast and efficient. However, I do agree with you that the support and its troubleshooting is bad. Sometimes, it's useless"
1027,1,"Works as specified. Forgive me if I still prefer Office 2003 but that's no longer available. Microsoft, as usual had to ""improve"" on an already great product, and I find the new user interface confusing. I would have loved it if there was an instant ""2003 mode""."
1410,1,"I have tried them all and keep coming back to Outlook.Microsoft got it right with this product.The spell checker is even better now, recognizing such things by context as form when it should be from.It also does a much better job of checking only the newly added text instead of trying to check the entire thing including previous included text.The Office 2007 Ribbon interface is a bit of a learning experience but is well worth the effort.You are allowed to activate 2 copies , one for the laptop and one for the desktop is my setup. I would not have bought it if not for that and suspect many others feel the same way."
27209,1,"CONCLUSIONEven an in-depth review can only scratch the surface of this incredible piece of software. Especially when looked at it from the perspective of creating DUB, and after establishing the endless technical possibilities, it can be said without apology that Reason 3.0 is what the computer based DUB producer of today is waiting for.While you are producing your music, you're already dealing with the sounds and the effects. You're building your tune on the vibe rather then your technical insight. This means, your final product will simply be the climax of your own experience. Reason definitely takes the boring school vibe out of computer based DUB production. Making the riddim and dubbing it will be the methods of which you will be educating yourself.Propellerhead Software knows very well, that producing music is an esthetic experience. Professionalism doesn't show in the amount of knowledge you managed to memorize. Making music is not the same as making cookies. Professionalism consists out of the ability to produce music that others will enjoy.The technical know-how comes as a natural fact, when you are developing yourself in the good way. You start to see the need for a compressor, for example, because you constantly think about ways of making a fatter bass. Technical books filled with formula's that only trigger your school-trauma's become interesting, because you know what you want to reach. And all these things come naturally in an environment such as created by the developers of Reason.The requirements are remarkably low for the high quality; the price is remarkably low for a complete studio with sequencer. The sounds are professional and because of the very large online community of Reason users, your collection is only bound to grow. Reason even reads open standards such as WAV and SF2, opening the door to other communities too.Releasing your music is easy, too. Reason will write your final product as a wave file, enabling you to use other software for further processing of the mix. Reason does have an internal mastering section, so the other software could in principal be limited to an MP3 encoder or CD burner.There are only a few reasons not to get the software.The first one may be, that you already own a big studio with musicians and digital devices. The second one may be, that you're not interested in creating DUB. The third one can only be, that you already own it.Full 27 page review on http://reviews.dubroom.org/various0002full.htm(including soundclips)"

53814,1,"Learn Catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base; however, i have taken about 5 years of Spanish and found the CD to be fairly basic, and while catalan differs in many ways, many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope. There are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist. I definitely have benefitted from this CD because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it. Overall, great for beginners, and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge."

88540,1,"I bought this for my 4 year old girl. She rarely watches Clifford so I took a chance with this one - but SHE LOVES IT! This game is a good solid tool for teaching and reinforcing reading and phonics. She now knows all the sounds each letter makes and can read more and more words. Only drawback, instead of wanting a kitty for a pet, she's now asking for a Big Red Dog - I tell her, ""We'll See!"" HA! Great game! Get it!"

35435,1,There are tons of mini games in this SpongeBob game (I think there are like 30 total). My favorite section is the Trivia which has questions on all of the Main Characters. I would reccomend this game for kids between the ages of 6-10.
88609,1,"My daughter loves this product! It covers her 2 favorite things the PC and the phone! Whenever I am on the computer she is always on my lap trying to push whatever keys she can, but with this I can put her in her highchair and put her in front of the PC and she will entertain herself for at least an hour! She espicially loves the phone aspect on the side and what I love is there is no cord to worry about. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone with a toddler, I started using this with my daughter when she was 12 months old, she is now 15 months and loves it more now that she has gone up to another level!"
46202,1,"What a program!! This is NOT a stripped-down version of ""real"" Photoshop but is a powerful and easy to use image manipulation tool. It is oriented toward the home digital photographer rather than the graphics professional but anyone should be able to get great results. I also purchased the book ""Photoshop Elements 2 Solutions"" by Mikkel Aaland. It's organized around specific tasks or projects and is very clearly written - a wonderful reference for both Elements and digital photography in general. The Manual that comes with Elements is pretty good but I recommend buying Aaland's book, too. I dabble in digital art (Coriel's Painter 7) and use Elements to manipulate reference photos and completed paintings in addition to home snapshots. Works great on my iMac running OS10.2"
82056,1,"I picked this up for my twelve year old son. He is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and eMedia Rock Guitar Method for the last two weeks. The program is a great starter, just in case the kids don't stick with it. It's better than $45 bucks an hour once a week, for now, at least.Great Product! I reccomend it."
6466,0,When I opened the package there was food residue or something all over the back of the disc. It was as if a child played with it after lunch. Luckily after a good wash with soap and water it all came off and there were no scratches! Good buy! It was way cheaper than in the store.
74166,2,"Ordered version 1.06, but was sent v. 1.05. Lavasoft website will upgrade the old version if I send them my order number. However they will not accept an Amazon number.

82801,0,"I brought SuSE 10.1 to use while I am on a job in Northern Wisconsin. I had a computer but no operating system. Rather than add to Gate's fortune I ordered 10.1. I have an earlier verison of this OS at home and found it easy to install in an older machine. The same holds true with 10.1. However, if you justt want an OS that works right out of the box this is not the one for you. This is especially true if you are connecting into a wireless router as I have to here.Getting the wireless card to work was an ordeal and an internet connection is a MUST. I was able to get my questions answered at Suse forum. With info from the forum I was able to configure the wifi card and download the nightly tarball needed to get the ra2500 wifi clip configured. With that my wireless card was working but would NOT connect to the router.Repeated questions to different Suse forums yeilded nothing. Finally I turned to Ubuntu Linux Forum (a GREAT GROUP!) for info to at least connect to the router though the terminal. KNetworkManager never was able to connect. It might be due to the password not being formatted correctly but I didn't feel like messing with it any more because I can connect through the terminal. So if you are using wifi and don't know a lot about it be prepared to spend a lot of time getting it to work.My second big complaint is that to listen to online radio streaming took even more of my time. Finally I got that problem sorted out by downloading what I needed.Despite all the time it took to get running Suse is a good OS and if you are connecting through a wired router or directly to a DSL connection setup is fast and easy. And it warms my heart to know that I am not adding to the bottom line of Microsoft!"
68965,1,"As you know physics is one of the toughest subjects you can take. I made a mistake by signing up for AP Physics. I have never taken a harder class. I purchased PhysicsTutor half-way through the school year and it really was able to boost my grade and help me prepare for the AP exam. I would suggest this great program for any physics student no matter what level. It can teach you and also quiz and refresh you, it is a real help! Physics only got easier after purchasing it."
62877,1,"This program is has been working very well for me. Though it is level 1, it does help if you have previous experience with the Korean language or at least some supplemental materials. There are no lessons for leaning the Hangul, the Korean writing system. It helps greatly if you already know this before hand.Learning vocabulary and basic grammatical patterns goes quickly because of the Rosetta Stone method of learning intuitively. This program is great for learning a language as long as it is supplement with other materials."

58209,0,"Let me just start off by saying that I probably would have enjoyed this game more if I hadn't had the wonderful experience of playing some of the later and more thought-out Nancy Drew games in this series. So comparitively, this game isn't so good, but if you haven't played any of them, it would probably be more fun. I did find this game fun -- it was much better than the first game in this series, Secrets Can Kill, but I found the next game in the series, Message in a Haunted Mansion, to be much more fun. If you are looking to buy one of these games as a gift, that is a great idea first of all. they are entertaining and fun for the whole family. Lots of games say that but these really are! It's also fun to work on them with your friends, siblings, etc, because when you get stuck, you can turn to your partner to help you move on.Anyway, more about the game... It is set in New York, and one of the biggest stars is receiving threatening letters. You are Nancy Drew and responsible for solving the mystery. Clues are everywhere, and you interact with characters and take taxis around New York.If you blow something up, fall off a cliff, or do something that would end your case in real life, you can always use the ""Second Chance"" feature and have a second chance. Actually, you can have as many chances as you need. And, if many people are working on this game at once but they are each playing separately, this can be accomadated -- the game can save up to 8 different games at different progresses in the mystery.This game is fun but it definitely isn't the best of them. If you are looking for a hard game, go with Danger on Deception Island, or Curse of Blackmoor Manor. A good game to give as a gift to somebody who doesn't have any of these games is Message in a Haunted Mansion. Each of the games is set in a different city or place -- one is on an island, one in a castle, one in a theater in St. Louis, one in San Francisco.... and the newest, Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, takes place on a train! There are tons of possibilities, and these games will keep you occupied for a really long time. These games are some of the best ever made! Happy gaming!!"
89696,1,"From my first experience with Microsoft's Windows 2000 Operating System I knew they had finally got it right. The desktop edition, Professional, makes all those BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) worries seem like old news along with the idiotic Scandisk. It is extremely reliable and if problems occur, the OS is smart enough to not let it effect other programs and prevents frequent restarts. If you're someone who likes to never shut-off your computer then this is definitely for you. For the standard home user, I would not recommend this. It does take some Tech knowledge to fully experience and it's hardware and software compatibilty are not as vast as Win98SE or Win ME because it is a business OS.

Once you complete entering your donations and save the file, it is practically impossible (following the instructions) to import your contributions into H&R Block @ Home Deluxe 2009.

14392,0,"As per another review in the listing... I have seen Intuit literally ruin this product by releasing versions of Quicken that, quite frankly should have never been release. I can tolerate the bugs in Turbo Tax (as it is a very time sensitive releast) - but based on all the bugs that they have had to fix on version 5 (they are on their 4th update... and it's not even a year old - one of which states when you go to their troubleshooting web page that there is a know error of which there is no fix or go around, and will be fixed with the next release, so you can have THEIR mistake fixed for 60 bucks). Also, trying to get a live person will cost you money, a long distance charge as there is no 800 number, and a hold time of 30 minutes or longer. Quicken used to be an outstanding product... I hope someday they will return to their roots!"
56468,1,"I bought this as something nice to run as a security feature on my computer. It is absolutely beautiful. I particularly like the ""book"" view where movies play in a book with turning pages! I chose to randomly play all the movies so I get a good mix of different space views. There is even an option for me to import my own quicktimes. And, it has this great peaceful music that plays with the videos that make it nice to look at. A great product! I recommend it."
89857,0,"ZoneAlarm is one of the best firewall programs on the market. Compared to Norton it was unbelievable how many intrusions were caught. It works seamlessly and rarely messes up new installs or access to web sites.Of course it depends on how you are going to set up ZoneAlarm.As for the Pro version I agree with other reviewers, you do not get a lot more for the money and although I want to see these developers do well I can't see the need to purchase to more expansive package. Also, several of my friends warned me to pass on this version as they had problems with unexplained shut downs and difficulty disabling ZoneAlarm Pro 3. In fact, both went back to the free version.Between ZoneAlarm and the (free) AVG anti-virus software except for automation there is no need for the commercial versions other than business licenses and more control. For home and casual users it's not worth the possible intrusions."
77775,1,"I was using HomeSite long before Macromedia purchased it, but didn't try Dreamweaver until earlier this year, when I downloaded the trial.Those who claim Dreamweaver is crash-prone are correct; I see the most crashes in mixed-mode, but the crashes are generally avoidable once you learn to work around them.I'm relatively new to CSS, PHP and MySQL, and DreamWeaver has eased my learning curve for these. That alone has been worth the purchase price. I also appreciate DW's extensibility, and the helpfulness of the DW Community.At root, DW is just another text editor, and is friendlier to the coder than the visually inclined. If you're the latter, you may prefer Adobe GoLive. For me, it's a step closer to visual web development from HomeSite, which I still use and enjoy."

7632,0,"Firstly, I must say that I haven't experienced the same bugs or problems with the functionality of Quickbooks 6 as the other reviewers. Perhaps my needs are simple, but It works fine for what I need. This review is written for those who will need to do PAYROLL, and is therefore aimed at the Aatrix part of the package:I rarely ever write reviews, but felt compelled to do so after seeing that I am apparently one of many who have been beaten to a pulp by Intuit's (for Mac) use of Aatrix Payroll software.A few weeks ago I resorted to searching the web for answers to my MANY Aatrix issues as my recent support calls to Aatrix regarding THEIR BUGGY SOFTWARE GLITCHES had me on hold for 3 hours (but only a mere 45 minutes the next day). And no, it was NOT an 800 number. The tech staff was very nice and helpful, but 3 HOURS ON HOLD????? I'm NOT exaggerating. Thank god for speaker phones, but it still ruined my day. What I did find on the web was LEGIONS of people having the same woes as me.I do give Aatrix credit for stepping in when Intuit failed to support the Mac community by not including this basic payroll function in their for Mac products. However, after using (and being abused) by Aatrix for the past 5 years, I finally reached my limit and searched for a Mac-based payroll alternative. Believing that I was somehow stuck with Aatrix, I was thrilled to find another company that not only makes one, but makes a far cheaper, easier, and IMHO superior program:CheckMark Payroll. They even sell it here at Amazon.comAnd the best part is, YOU CAN IMPORT TO QUICKBOOKS. So far all my pay data has landed safely and perfectly in QB6. I could go point-for-point and compare, but please take my word. It is SOOOOOOO much simpler to use. No more jumping through hoops, no bugs, no missing numbers, no crashes, works like a charm, AND CHEAPER. Yes the Aatrix comes free now if you buy QB (I stuck to my old classic QB4 merely to avoid having to do tax reports and forms and such all in Aatrix, and therefore have paid probably $1000. in version and tax table updates), but you'll want to bash your head against the nearest concrete wall before too long. My head still hurts, by the way. My advice would be to buy the QB6 if you want it, but forget Aatrix all together. You'll waste far more time (=money) on this ""initially free"" program than the cost of buying CheckMark.Thank you CheckMark. Thank you, thank you, and thank you!"
7525,1,"I recently received the assignment from my boss to evaluate the various digital photography/image editing programs in the ~$$$ price range. Included were:- Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0- Microsoft Digital Image Pro 9.0- Ulead PhotoImpact 8.0- Jasc Paintshop Pro 9.0My review centered around three criteria: image mainpulation, advanced design and photo effects, and suitability for making web graphics. I spent a total of 16 hours on the various programs performing a pretty intensive evaluation in order to determine which product to select for our business. (We needed to purchase a large site license and so there was a lot of $$$ at stake.)I will tell you that, much to my surprise, PhotoImpact came out on top - not just overall but in each of the three areas individually, as well. I say ""to my surprise"" because it's definitely the underdog. It doesn't have the kind of sensationalism that the other seem to have, and you don't see it advertised all that much. But it's definitely the champ.I found PhotoImpact and Paintshop Pro the easiest to use when it came to digital photography features. (Photoshop Elements was far too difficult for business use, and Digital Image Pro far too simplistic, in my opinion.) But PhotoImpact takes the cake in this area because its drag-and-drop orientation is very straightforward.When it comes to the higher-end design features, PhotoImpact was the clear winner. It supports Adobe's plug-in architecture, so all of the cool filters you can get for Photoshop (and elements, for that matter) are compatible with PhotoImpact. But PhotoImpact gives you a much greater degree of control over customizability than Photoshop Elements, the no. 2 contended in this second area, in my opinion. Once again, it's very easy to create some spectacular effects: There's built-in sophisticated vector drawing (which none of the other evaluated products have), as well as 3D text with some outstanding effects.And, lastly, in the area of web graphics, PhotoImpact came in tops with Paintshop Pro following second. PhotoImpact has a great system for compressing GIFs, plus it includes a GIF animation application that's really sweet.Anyway, I hope this helps all you image editing shoppers. Wish I had seen this sort of review upfront; it would have made the decision much easier for me,"
51399,1,"I'll concur with some of the bad reviews; Ulead's customer support is snotty at their very best, and that's after sitting on hold for a half hour. However, I'm rejecting some of the bad reviews largely because the posters don't seem to know what to do with the software. DVD MovieFactory is ideal *if* you capture the video somewhere else. If you have a digital capture card, use the application that came with it to do the capturing (I use Creative's DigitalVCR). MovieFactory will only import files that adhere to DVD standards, so you'll probably need to convert the file to a 720x480 Mpeg-2. Adobe Premiere 6.5's MainConcept plugin can do that. However, once all that is said and done, MovieFactory works very smoothly. You can set chapter points effortlessly, create detailed sub menus for chapters, and even have accompanying music to each and every menu. Definately try it out before purchasing it, but if you give it what it wants, I think you'll be happy."

27745,0,"I've used Vista 64-bit Home Premium for 2 months. Here's the problems:* It locks up for no reason requiring re-boot;* Often, re-booting fails as does time-consuming repairs, which can take hours;* When repairs do work, you will find that many files are erased, requiring a reload of software (HP printer files seemed especially vulnerable.);* Adobe Flash player and other software are not supported for the only 64-bit internet explorer (Videos won't play in Window's explorer.);* Replacing software is expensive.The best solution for the software incompatibility is to load Firefox. Fortunately, Vista 64 will allow compatible 32-bit software to run. When I find software that won't run on Window's 64-bit explorer I try it on Firefox, which says it will never convert to 64-bit.Don't even think about Windows 7. I am told that it is nothing more than Vista 32 bit service pack 2. If you have Visa, you have service pack 2 for free from Microsoft.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."
75490,1,"For benefit of the doubt, I gave Corkscrew Follies 4 stars, because 3 was too low and there is no 3.5. Yes, Corkscrew Follies is a decent and pleasing expansion to Roller Coaster Tycoon and offers many new scenarios and editing capabilities to the original, but it seemed slightly rushed and there were many obvious additions that should have been made but were not. Let's hope they end up in the second expansion slated for the summer of 2000.There are a few more Roller Coasters, and Gentle Rides, and a Great expansion of the shops and stalls one can build. However, I was a bit let down with the minimal amount of Thrill Rides. Also, though Scenery was expanded and what was added is beautiful, it could have gone much, much further.A real nice addition is the ride 'foot-printing' and the sound files for specific rides, and the expanded color options. The detail on sprites and new graphics is incredible.Now the scenarios...Yes, unlike many expansion this does very well in delivering MANY more scenarios that will keep you posted to your screen for hours on end, you definitely get your moneys worth here. However, where as the original scenarios were a tad easy, the expansion scenarios are a bit hard at times. You are so rushed on meeting requirements at times, you don't have the time to truly design the ride you wanted to make, but rather forced to using the pre-built coasters in any available space you can find. This detracts from the main function of the game...the chance to build and experiment your own steel monsters."
24393,1,"I have Windows XP and the game downloaded fine on my computer.This game is very accurate. It does a great job of gently reflecting the racism during the time. But by no means does it encourage racism! It mentions people buying their way out of slavery, the California Gold Rush, etc. It even has the Chinese building the transcontinental railroad! All these details show that the people who developed this game really knew their history.The game also gave great realistic information for anyone who wanted to survive the Oregon trail. The player can learn about the variety of animals to pull a wagon, how to cross a river, about different species of fish and plants, etc.The game was a lot of fun. But it was actually pretty short. The increase in features from older versions may have led to decrease in playing time.I would definitely recommend for any parent to buy this for his/her kid."

We didn't even buy a map of the UK.Cons: It does not have the little stuff, if you get off the main roads onto the little fun roads many will not be on the GPS. One township had been in the same spot from before the birth of Jesus Christ, no where on the Garmin system.Bottom line: I would use it again, dollars well spent, just know the limitations before you use it. It would have been helpful if we would have bought a map to support it, but we made it without one."

Thus, I have copied this review to this page because I think it will be helpful.JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade 3-CD-ROM set, December 18, 2007A Kid's ReviewHello, I'm StoryMaker, a JumpStart fan. JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade was among the first JumpStart games I've owned; only JumpStart Kindergarten (Deluxe, not Advanced, version) predates it. I think I (or someone else) got it for Christmas a LONG time ago. Since this particular version of JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade comes with 3 CD-ROMs, I will review each individually. (There is also a 4-CD-ROM version, BTW.) My review will be pretty long, 'cause it's really more like 3 reviews stuck together with little extra bits at the start & end. If you don't want to read all 3 parts, just read the first ""Fundamentals"" part and the bit at the bottom. Here we go!#1: FUNDAMENTALSThis is, by far, the BEST CD-ROM in the set. It was originally sold individually as the original JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade. In this game, a little dog named Squirt is just riding his scooter peacefully when Jimmy Bumbles, a weasel & school bully, knocks him off and breaks his scooter. Luckily, Squirt's OK, but no longer has a scooter. However, the prize for winning the JumpStart Scooter Tournament (which is coming up) is a new Super Scooter! Unfortunately, Squirt can't really win it, because...uh, he has no scooter. More familiar JumpStart friends such as Frankie the dog and Hopsalot the rabbit are determined to win it for him. However, Jimmy has supreme scooter skills, and the only way the JumpStart pals can stand a chance against him is to add gadgets to their scooters. All of your JumpStart friends will be happy to give you gadgets to add, but they need some favors to be done. Also, some of the gadgets need to be obtained in special ways. Kids complete these tasks in the form of games to earn scooter power-ups.This CD-ROM is very good. Not only are the games VERY fun, but they teach a wide variety of 1st Grade subjects - everything from math to early zoology. I think this is where I learned adding double-digit numbers, alphabetizing, and ordinals. My younger sister, Chocolate Dog, also benefited from it.This game, like other JumpStart Advanced ""Fundamentals"" CD-ROMs, has a feature called the ""All Star"". At the start of the game, kids are instructed to ""take a quiz & find out their learning style"". As a young child, I found this confusing, and I think I ended up just clicking on my favorite character. That's the bad part. The good part: In the corner of the screen of the main game, there is a star. When clicked, a phone pops up. You can call up your JumpStart pals for info on all the subjects taught in the game. Each character gives different kinds of information. I usually find Hopsalot's straightforward answers to be most helpful. Sometimes, the scientific nature-loving CJ Frog is a help. It really depends, and I don't think kids just have a single learning style.I think that JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade Fundamentals is quite good. There are a few things that bug me, though. For one thing, some games, such as Casey Cat's Phonics Soccer & CJ Frog's Spelling/Math Swamp Game, must be played over and over and over and OVER again to earn a single power-up. Because of this, we avoided them. Also, since many of the games are arcade-styled, you can sometimes get an incorrect answer simply due to obstacles, bad aim, etc. In additon, you can trade power-ups, which I think is good, but I had to go to the online user manual to find out how - it wasn't clear at all. However, this CD-ROM is overall the best one in the JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade 3-pack, hands down.#2: MUSICThough Fundamentals is very high quality, this CD-ROM, ""Music"", takes a deep dive downward when it comes to quality. In this game, Hopsalot the rabbit gets sucked up into an heirloom gramophone. Totally bogus, huh? He is whisked away to the weird & wacky world of ""The Land of Music"". A big weirdo guy named Sir Sournote is causing trouble and making all the music sour. So duh, Hopsalot has to stop him.Not only are the activities & games on this CD-ROM very BORING, but they are also very difficult. OK, so there's this game (actually, a lot of games) where you must repeat a beat. IT'S SERIOUSLY HARD. This game is for ages 5-8 and, even if you're way over the top of the age range, it is still difficult to get the beats right. And if you don't get the beats right, then the characters might insult you: ""THAT'S BAAAAAAAAAAAD!""This CD-ROM frustrates and annoys MUCH more than it teaches. Please DO NOT buy the individually sold version of JumpStart Music! You might find that your money is wasted! We have not played this LAME GAME in YEARS. If you seriously want to get it, PLEASE get it in with JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade ~OR~ get one of the 4 different JumpStart Fun Packs: Preschool, Kindergarten, 1st Grade and/or 2nd Grade. I've never played any JumpStart Fun Pack, but all of them but Preschool come with JumpStart Music. Not that anybody would actually want JumpStart Music...#3: ART CLUBJumpStart Art Club is the only disc that comes with JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade that was never sold individually. Indeed, it comes only with this pack (and the 4-CD-ROM version). It is sorta in-between Fundamentals & Music: not super good, not super bad, just in-between. In this CD-ROM, you make storybooks, crafts, banners & greeting cards starring your favorite JumpStart friends. It is pretty fun to make the crafts & entertaining to make all sorts of stories for the storybooks, but it is a very simple CD-ROM. There really isn't any animation in it, and all of the projects are simplified (the storybooks can only have up to 6 pages, you only design the front of the greeting cards, etc.). You never really ""draw"" in any of the projects - you mostly just use stickers. Coloring in spaces is the closest you ever get. Also, it really doesn't have educational value. It *sorta* teaches *a little bit of* creativity, but other than that, zero-zilch-nada. Overall, it's OK, MUCH better than Music, but definitely worse than Fundamentals.Overall, JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade 3-CD-ROM set is pretty darn good. The Music & Art Club CD-ROMs aren't so great, though, so you might consider getting the original JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade with only the one Fundamentals CD-ROM. You might consider the 4-CD-ROM version, though I've never played it. Check out some of the other great JumpStart games & workbooks! Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
53574,0,"Roads and Recreation works well with a mapping Garmin GPS, but has not been updated in a long time. The current and original version 3.00 is missing some major highways built since 1999 and some since 1998. If you don't mind occasionally driving across empty countryside (on your mapping GPS), then this product is pretty good. For roads before 1999, major and minor, it works well as a download into a mapping Garmin GPS. For PC-only use it does not compare with other products such as those from Delorme (Street Atlas)or Microsoft. Garmin should be honest about its MapSource products and tell the user when they were last updated. This is especially true for its basic marine software, Waterways and Lights. Software sells fancy GPS units. In the case of Garmin, adequate best describes the software. It's right up there with a 3-year old telephone directory. Most everyone is listed, except..."
9308,1,"I've had very good luck with Norton since way back in the DOS days. My System Works, works very well, but like most programs I don't let them run my machine, I run them. I'm no computer geek, but my PC isn't a toaster and I have to use my head. Norton utilities is usually one of the first things I install on a new machine. But I don't have any part of System Works running in the background, with the exception of the anti-virus. I use what I want, when I want and then turn it off. Over the years, I find this works best. The speed-disk utility and the Windoctor utility are the ones I use the most. They are worth the usual discount price by themselves.Norton isn't perfect, and the documentation must be followed (turn off all that background junk that the machine has running) carefully, but like any good tool, once I've learned to use it, it works consistently, reliably and without glitches. In well over a decade and a half of using Norton utilities of one flavor or another, I've never had occasion to call customer support, so I can't address that issue."
21404,1,"This is wonderful software. I bought it for my 6-year old son (1st grade) and he absolutely loves it. He has even helped his 4-year old brother solve several of the games.

39201,1,"I have the multi-language version of this software, which includes Spanish, Italian, French and German. So I'm reviewing each single-language version as well so those shopping for language-learning software will know exactly what to expect from this.Before You Know It uses the flashcard method of teaching vocabulary four ways. Words and phrases are divided into lists by category. User selects a list then goes to the activity of choice to learn the contents of that list. There are a few more activities available in the Deluxe version that the free trial version doesn't have, but both versions use virtual flashcards the following way:Step 1 - Look at the foreign word and take a guess (out loud or in your head - it doesn't matter because the software trusts you to tell it if you answered correctly). The program will also say the word so you know the proper pronunciation.Step 2 - Look at the foreign word and type in it in English in the space provided. Here you don't get to cheat, because it can tell if your correct or not. The ones you need work on will repeat more often.Step 3 - Look at the English word and guess the foreign one. Again, it will trust you to be honest.Step 4 - Look at the English word and type in the foreign one. This has been the most helpful of all the steps for me, because not only do I have to know the word by now, I have to know how to spell it correctly and include any necessary accent marks.All of the above you can get with the basic version of Before You Know It that is available to download for free via the internet. Why not try it out before you purchase the deluxe version?With the deluxe version, you get more four more activities which include multiple choice, pronunciation practice where you can record your voice and compare your pronunciation with a native speaker (warning: software does NOT include a microphone), and dictation (which is just a repeat of step 4 of the flashcard portion).My favorite thing about this software, though, and what made me go ahead and spend the money for the deluxe version, is the user's ability to customize the program in several different ways:- User can add a word to any list. You just look up more words you want to know online or in a dictionary and add it to the appropriate category.- User can delete any word from any list.- User can copy any word from one list to another.- User can edit any word in any list. This is handy when studying Spanish because you might want to change the translation from European to Latin American.- User can create entire lists and categories of their own, add their own pictures and record their own voices to demonstrate the pronunciation of each word. You can create lists for anything you want to learn - not just languages.- User can download additional, free lists from the Before You Know It website, including state capitals, periodic table of elements (chemistry), multiplication tables, and more. And you can sign up for the free ""list of the week."" Each week, a new list will be sent to you via email.This software will help you master your foreign vocabulary and learn helpful phrases, but it does not teach the rules of grammar for these languages. You won't learn conjugation unless you look up the form of each word yourself and add it to their lists or create your own lists.In other words, the customizing possibilities for this are almost endless if you're willing and able to invest the time to do it. But what it comes with already installed is meant to simply increase your foreign vocabulary and, used alone, will not make anyone a fluent speaker."
29941,2,"I've used Norton security products for years - some versions have been better than others. This year I renewed my subscription with the 3-PC version of Norton Internet Security 2007 (prior version was Norton Internet Security 2006). This was a mistake.With NIS 2007 my system takes about twice as long to boot and seems to be running much slower, especially when starting programs.Components included in the program disk in NIS 2006 (e.g.Spam blocking, privacy, parental blocking, etc) require downloading from the Norton web site with a separate installation procedure. While this ""add-on"" is free, NIS 2007 documentation with the program disk doesn't point you to the download site and finding out how to download it required searching the Norton web site.I use Eudora as my email program. The spam blocker in NIS 2006 integrated nicely and worked well with Eudora. The spam blocker in NIS 2007 does NOT support Eudora. Apparently the spam blocker in NIS 2007 only integrates with MS Outlook/Outlook express. Use Eudora or other email programs? You are probably out of luck and your in box is full of spam.I un-installed NIS 2007 and reinstalled 2006. In my situation 2007 is NOT a better product, it is a step backward.Hopefully Norton will quickly provide a fix for these problems.

Plug this into your USB port after installing the software. Click on the Instant DVD Recorder, and use the advanced option. You get the whole menu on your screen, you pick what you want, and bam, your video is now recording right to disk.Quality? It's fine, you're going from tape to DVD, it will still be tape quality.Cautions: Make sure your computer/laptop isn't too old. This item NEEDS USB 2.0. Get an PMCIA adapter card if you're still running USB 1.1. Online auctions sell them cheaply."

90898,2,"As an instructor for a one credit hour class in Job Search Strategies, one of the primary goals of the course is for each student to develop resumes, cover letters, business cards, and references sheets.I have a range of students with varying degrees of Microsoft Office proficiency, and this year's progress is significantly slower than previous classes. The new Word Command interface initially impresses the user with it's slick styling and sleek look, until you actually need to find a specific command, and then the user-hostile, maze-like nature of the interface becomes all to apparent.Despite our school's policy of choosing which software packages we teach based on those that are most prevolent in industry, Word has proven to be such an exercise in frustration for students ranging from novices through experts, that all classes after this one will be using Openoffice.org Writer, which is not only more user friendly but completely free, and available for Windows, MacOSX, and Linux.I have never had a problem with Microsoft Office software until this the 2007 latest incarnation. Word 2007 is an utter and complete waste of money and time."

3687,1,"For the package buyers a warning, you probably need to update the program before it will work. I wanted to see what would happen if I tried the software right out of the box and it wasn't pretty. Do yourself a favor and update as soon as you get the prompt. Even if you don't see a prompt, update!! Many retailers have a return time limit so check to make sure the program is in working order.The good part is the update seems to be the big key cause the whole program worked as well as possible. The burning program worked as expected. I even tested some video footage to make sure I didn't experience RAM problems. Lastly I used some of the smaller functions like disc scan and backup. With everything aok I've been trying to complete some video projects. This includes menu making and label printing. If you are worried about getting a program that doesn't work well on your pc, I would try to check off the functions you will use a lot. I'm statisfied that this program will take care of my media projects."

48573,1,"I used to work with Cubase and Sonar and I always felt more like fighting with the program than being assited by it. In my world, technology should work for you and not the other way around. I got a demo version of this software and I was very amazed to find an ""all in one solution"" for my home studio recordings and productions. Live is so darn intuitive and easy to navigate (it features an extremely helpful ""info"" window that gives you details on whatever you are clicking on -don't panic, you can turn it off anytime).In addition, it can host your existing stock of VST's, and integrate Reason thru Rewire quite easily. The full release also features some of the simplest-yet-coolest collection of ableton's exclusive synths. Audio configurations are done in a breeze, and navigating, recording, looping, selecting and editing audio clips have never been easier for me. It also features some of the coolest dj/live performance tools around, so I might just say that its possibilities appear endless to me.It is my humble recommendation that you get this together with Reason 3 and Sony's Soundforge to get your homestudio turbocharged into the future (and while we're at it, I thoroughly recommend getting a copy of Arturia's Minimoog too!). I'm just a couple of hundred bucks (!) short from the full release, but in a month or so I'll have enough dough to get a copy of this program. Stop fighting and start unleashing your full musical potential."

I have tried several of the popular products currently available including Norton and Kaspersky. And I would have to give a big edge to McAfee. I have used it extensively both in a personal, as well as professional, capacity. And it has worked spectacularly in both. The biggest complaint that I do have about VirusScan is that it will keep flagging certain files as bad and quarantine them even after you tell it that they are legit files. Other than that, I would highly recommend McAfee."

It's truly amazing!The only draw back of the system is that when the Parallels program is active, it does slow down my operating system significantly. Not so much that I can't work, but it's noticeable. Still, it's nowhere near the difference in time it would take to restart my computer each time to switch operating systems. I wouldn't recommend the program to use with anything less than a 2GHz processor.-Brendan"
27007,1,"I have been a pretty happy, satisfied Trend Micro PC Cillin user for many years now. Not too long ago I downloaded the 2007 version of their suite.friend of mine did too. We both ran into some fairly wacky problems; Hers evens worse than mine. Decided 2007, though it has potential, wasn't quite ready for prime time yet. May check on it again in a few months.Kaspersky's antiviral reputation has been very high for years, and so I thought I would drop PC Cillin and take their suite for a spin.No problems with the installation. Their general layout is more confusing...to me anyway...than PC Cillin's. But default settings would suit most folks. And I finally found my way around. For once it might be eaier for most to go ahead and read their pretty thorough manual before installing though.( I didn;t...lol...but read it later).I put in a little extra effort and am in the process of placing all their protections on max....just to see if that will cause any problems....maybe back off to their more easy going and recommended ( for most users)security levels. The result is plenty of popups for several days asking whether they should allow certain processes. Usually it is pretty easy to determine how to respond. Actually it has been easy every time so far. For instance when I first moved to check for and download new Spysweeper definitions, I got four popups from kaspersky...each from different aspects of their computer protection. I instructed it to add Spysweeper to the trusted zone in all, and so the next time I downloaded SS updates there was nary a popup.For the most dedicated user, the program can be customized in pretty minute detail....if you want to spend the time.The auto setting is definitely the way to go on downloads, and they come pretty frequently and seamlessly.Call for a restart only every now and then.Their shields have alread stopped 3 attempted attacks from the ol Helkern Slammer worm. Amazed that chesnut is still around.It's real time HTTP internet activity scans are a large plus. It's email scans do not seem to slow Outlook down much.Kaspersky has some ingenious methods of detecting on the fly if a file it is scanning has changed or not since the last scan. if not, it leaves it alone. So though initial scans can take a long time, subsequent scans are much faster. Some are incredibly quick.It puts a moderate footprint on computer action. Nothing too serious. But i wouldn;t call it light. ( I have a 3.2 processor and a couple gigs of ram) Slows you down a bit here and there. The scans are easy to schedule, and run unobobtrusively in the background.Resident Office Outlook 2003 is my email program of choice, and it already has excellent junk mail handling techniques...so I disabled K's antispam component. Can't speak to its quality.All I know about it's firewall is that it has performed well in leak tests. Certainly better than average. (my impression was the new PC Cillin 2007 shield is strong too. Much improved over 2006 in that regard).Tests around the world vary so often, and the security landscape is in such flux, that it isn't easy to know which tester to believe and when to believe tests at all. But Kapersky detection rates on tests generally range from very good to superb. Often enough at the very top.One feature of PC Cillin I miss is their option to secure certain critical data from any web access....stuff like passwords and credit card numbers. But Kaspersky stands a good chance of blocking those attempts from ever occuring without needing that particular feature.Unlesss you get very unlucky with system conflicts ( like one person who has posted here), after the teaching mode's popups pass, this should be a solid set it and forget it suite.I like Kaspersky's honesty in their spyware detection. So many antispyware programs go after simple really harmless tracking cookies just to boost their detection rep. Kaspersky does not do that. They are like a stealth bomber that refuses to attack civilians in that regard.Somebody said that the only 100% secure computer is an unplugged computer. And that is, in my opinion, true actually. Kaspersky is honest enough to say pretty much exactly the same thing in their manual. But you certainly can tilt the odds heavily in your security's favor by wise browsing, email, download, and file sharing choices....and also by using this suite."

10552,0,"Okay, so this game can be a littl hard, and sometimes a little annoying. But it is not Disney's fault if a game doesn't live up to the movie. For one thing, Disney doesn't even make the games themselves, They have a supporting company make them. I read a couple of reviews saying that 4-5 year olds have gotten frustrated with the game. Let me tell you something, If a child gets frustrated with something, don't just sit there and let them get frustrated. Help them out a bit, even if it may be hard for you too. I babysit a 5 year old that gets frustrated with this game, but she keeps trying, and doesn't give up. I understand not all kids are like this. They like to have fun when they're on the computer, and they don't want any challenges. If this is the case, then maybe they should stick with learning games, and not try to play action/adventure games until they get old enough to understand what they have to do in the game.Anyway, I give this game a 3 rating. It is a decent challenge, but not recommended for kids under 5, unless they have an adult by thier side to help."
68573,1,"When I first opened the box and looked at the details, there were two things that concerned me right away:1) The card does not capture audio. It requires that the audio signal is routed through your sound card.2) The card lists several capture formats, but it's important to note that the various formats are available via *software*. i.e., it appears that the card itself just captures frames, and it's the Pinnacle Studio software that does the conversion into DV/MPEG/etc. in real-time.However, even with those two limitations I did a 2-hour capture from an old VHS tape (albeit via a Time Base Corrector box) and the whole capture went flawlessly. Not a single dropped frame, and no out-of-sync audio (the most common problems one might have with such a capture setup).I have/had a Hauppauge PVR-250, Pinnacle DC10+, Pinnacle AV/DV, and various capture capabilities integrated into video cards. This card fits into the middle of the lot. It doesn't have the integrated audio capture or hardware compression capabilities of the PVR-250 or the AV/DV, but it works well, and the flexibility of capture formats (albeit via software) is nice to have."

36474,1,"...For some reason...but probably related to powering on and off the Firewire CD burner, forcing Finder to restart, and having problems with Toast simultaneously, my VST 30GB SmartDisk went Kaplooey!... OS X would ""see"" it (a check of the console log indicated that it was being found but there was an ""fsck failure""--such a helpful message) and report that I should use the Disk Utility on it. Disk Utility reported the oft-mentioned ""Keys out of order"" error message of death, claimed to fix it, and accomplished nothing after repeated verifications and repairs.According to several websites, though Apple remains silent on the matter, the only way to fix this problem is to reformat the drive, an unacceptable proposition. I began the march through my utilities.Norton Utilities 4.0 and 5.0 wouldn't touch it--the drive is Firewire and couldn't be seen without an attempt to mount it by the Finder causing the ""format or forget it"" message. Same for DiskWarrior 2.1. Techtools 3.0.5 wouldn't do it, either, for still yet the same reason. FWB HDT can't fix anything. Bottom line, anything running in Classic or OS 9 wouldn't do anything with the drive other than offer to format it for me and I had nothing native to OS X. So I ordered SystemWorks which claims to be the OS X utility for everything.Surprisingly, it worked! It fixed the ""keys of death"" problem and (poof!) my drive was back and in good health. As best I can tell, no data were lost. In other words, I had a very, very positive experience. Where Disk Utility absolutely falls flat on its face, SystemWorks came through!I highly recommend the product, even though I haven't checked out a single one of its other features."

One annoyance is that you have to keep refreshing whenever you delete something---otherwise, objects that were obscured by the deleted object are not redrawn. However, this is a minor problem, and might even be beneficial if you have a slow computer. I cannot compare this program to any other, since it is the only one I have used. But, so far it has been easy to do whatever I need. I would recommend this program based on its low price, flexibility, and ease of use."
35730,1,"It's hard to write bulleted lists of pros and cons, because this program does one thing extremely well, and anything it doesn't do has clearly been intentionally omitted. The one thing it does is prepare you for effective oral communication when traveling in China.I am a huge Pimsleur fan and somewhat less of a Rosetta Stone fan, although I have used both quite a bit, for several languages (including Chinese). If you are going to travel in China and just want to spend money on one product, you should get Fluenz Mandarin for the following reasons:* It is self-contained (i.e. you don't need any other materials to use it). Although Pimsleur is allegedly self-contained, I have never gone through any Pimsleur course without looking up details in other books about the vocabulary and grammar covered. Maybe I didn't need to do that, but I am able to absorb new language knowledge better when I have more information about it. Fluenz provides all the information and explanation needed to completely understand the lessons. As far as Rosetta Stone goes, anyone who has used it for a non-Romance language knows it's pretty hard to use it completely on its own.* It covers the most useful knowledge first. I used to think Pimsleur did this--and compared to Rosetta Stone, it definitely does--but Fluenz is *awesome* for this. Pimsleur has a little too much conversational stuff that you don't really *need* (how many kids do you have?, etc.), whereas Fluenz is 100% practical for travelers (highlight: how to actually direct a taxi driver). Once again, Rosetta Stone comes in a very distant third in this category.* It explains tones. I personally don't find the tones in Mandarin all that tricky, but it probably would have taken me much longer to get them if all I had had to learn from was Pimsleur or Rosetta Stone. Hearing Mandarin spoken and practicing yourself is essential for making the tone pronunciation sound natural, but getting an explanation up front is helpful for adults, I believe. Fluenz also teaches you to read Pinyin (Pimsleur doesn't do this but Rosetta Stone does), which is important if you want to be able to look things up in an electronic dictionary or read place names in tour guidebooks (check for tone markings when buying such books).As far as whether you need to be like a baby and not hear any English and whatnot (a possible criticism of Fluenz), in my opinion that's just silly. I have found English becomes jarring when I'm studying another language only if *I* have to speak it (which Fluenz does not make you do). I do enjoy *in-person* instruction in another language where little if any English is spoken (by a very skillful instructor who is able to interact with his students in an effective manner) but a computer program cannot interact with you in this way (doing further explanations of things you don't understand, etc.), so the next best thing is to have someone outright explain things--in English--so you can absorb the information more effectively. Fluenz Mandarin does a good job of this.One thing Fluenz Mandarin doesn't do is teach you any Chinese characters whatsoever. I believe this omission makes sense given the goal of effective oral communication when traveling. Even if you can't read a menu you'll probably be okay if you can at least ask what they have, and you won't have spent all that time learning characters when you could have been learning to say stuff. (By the way, ""I don't read Chinese"" is a helpful introductory phrase in such situations. Note to Fluenz: I know you don't want to be negative in your curriculum, but this might be a nice one to include in the lessons. I feel a little less dumb about asking what they have when the menu's right in front of me if I start out with ""Wo3 kan4 bu dong3 zhong1wen2."") If you want about the same level of instruction in reading characters as this program gives in speaking, I highly recommendI Can Read That: A Traveler's Introduction to Chinese Charactersby Julie Sussman.The one other ""con"" (and I feel a little bad saying it) is that I really did not enjoy Sonia as an instructor. I found some of her mannerisms and her slightly nonstandard American English pronunciation distracting, and it goes without saying (although I'll say it anyway) that having a non-native speaker doing the main teaching (including that of pronunciation!) is less than ideal. I do believe that the drills (""workouts"") were recorded by native speakers, though, so you won't be too harmed by this. Fortunately Fluenz has corrected this in Level 3 by having a different instructor do the lessons.Other recommendations:If you are very motivated after doing Fluenz, also check out Pimsleur's Mandarin Chinese (I, II, and III). If you are going to be in China for some time, Pleco ([...]) offers a great Chinese/English dictionary to carry around with you. If you have internet access, [...] has even more words (especially proper nouns such as brand names and countries). These are both useful for looking up words if you hear them in Pimsleur or on the street, or if you need to supplement your Fluenz-learned vocabulary in a real life situation.In summary, I would highly recommend this program to anyone who is going to spend time in China, and if you are going to buy only one program, this would be the best choice of all I've seen."
20224,0,Publisher 2002 is a pretty good product. I haven't had any of the prolems that some other people have had it runs great on my machine never crashed. It has some really good templates from menus to flyers to paper airplanes. and it is pretty simple to use once to get a little used to it.The photo editior on the other hand does basically nothing. You can find a much more robust photo editior on-line for free! I would suggest saving the few bucks and getting publisher only. The bundle discount is not even worth the money.
65600,1,"The listed features can be intimidating, but my experience is that the menus are so literal that anyone can find anything. There is a major menu which lists all the programs and tasks. I find that it is much easier to use the task based menus then you don't have to know all the names of the programs. Basically the whole suite manages music, video, photo, ringtones, mobile player files. The programs are for making projects out of the files, backing them up, and converting them.The very first thing I wanted was to edit some photos to put in a frame. I was able to resize the photos very easily as well as crop them. One thing about digital photos, sometimes the quality is not as good as film. I changed the contrast so more of the details popped. The photo program is very good and I now use it all the time. The program also took care of burning a cd so I could have a store print out the photos. I also saw the program will burn a set top player dvd. I made a slide show out of more photos. As I was going through the show, I saw some flaws and was able to change them while still in the show program. I saved the show as a video and sent it to the raw dvd. The program listed the format options and I chose the set top one. This is a good way to share photos for people w/o email and a computer dvd.I don't have a camcorder but I do have a lot of video clips. Again the program has a good editing program. I identified the clips with text and again burned them to a set top dvd. I can watch them on my tv set too.I could go on about other features but you get the picture. The many programs will cover all aspects of the media projects."

So, when my web update told me about a new release, I had no problem shelling out the $30 upgrade price. Now I'm kind of wishing I had come here first to check out other reviews, because guess what, Defrag problems.Just like another reviewer here, SM4 told me my drive was 37% fragmented, when the XP tool said don't worry about it. My HD is a 40Gig and was about 50% full. I started the process at 3:00 p.m and by morning the process was still running, after 36 HOURS it was still running. Finally, I stopped it out of sheer fear that a HD constantly working for 36 would kill my computer for sure. So I waited a couple of days and tried the Quick defragment (instead of the Optimized). Same result. Took forever, however, this time the program popped up an error box indicating to run Scandisk because their program can't defrag my HD! Well, I ran scandisk and NO ERRORS found (physical or logical). And their Spyware removal tool is a joke. Stick with Ad-Aware and Spybot for that.I did like the RAM recovery and defrag feature in this version though.The interface/GUI is much nicer than the previous versions, but I'm kind of feeling that I paid for a prettier looking program, other than a more functional one."
40072,1,"Apple iLife '08I have had all of the iLife software updates so far and this is the best ever. I was somewhat concerned that iMovie had been ""dumbed down"" and would not be as good as the previous edition, but to my surprise, it was better in many ways even though it had missing some of the features of the old version. I didn't mind, because what was there, worked beautifully. I did not evaluate the Garage Band as I haven't used it yet. iPhoto worked better than ever without the old organizational format which I didn't use anyway. The iWeb works seamlessly and as a first timer, I was pleased with the results.For the price it is a real bargain, in the world of software upgrades."

6284,1,"I have been with the service since 1999 or thereabouts and would not imagine quitting it.For some time, I had two accounts with them - one for myself and one for my mother who could no longer write her own checks.I was her POA and lived half a continent from her. I was also working a stressful job which gave me little time to write out checks for myself, much less somebody else.When she finally passed, the service also provided reports which were extremely helpful to her probate attorney, as I made sure that all expenses I paid went through Paytrust.During the time I have been with the service, only two checks have gone astray. We are talking twelve years here.As far as checks taking time to get to their destination, now at least half the bills are sent by EFT, and on those which are paid that way, the companies post the amount faster than I even expect. (Very often next day). On non-EFT checks, Paytrust gives a reliable estimate about when they will arrive at their destination. Yes, they may take a few days longer than it would if I wrote a local check and sent it locally, but that's not a problem with upfront planning, and, again, there is a paper trail.There have been many changes over the last 12 years, and I have to say that the only change in Paytrust is that it has gotten better."
56409,2,"This is the third or fourth version of Street Atlas USA Handheld I've bought. On each of the prior occasions I gave up trying to use it with a variety of PDAs. One more time I thought since DeLorme boasted of the major revision they'd made.Not really. It is still a stinkeroo.It installs easily to a Palm device and earlier versions installed easily to Windows CE. And it works nicely with a non-DeLorme Blutetooth GPS.But it is useless on a PDA. Maps are shown in 2D view only and they are simply thin lines across the screen. Street names even in the optional large font size are still unreadable unless you focus intensely. The highest zoom setting still covers too much area while the lowest zoom settings result in such crowded data that your route is lost.The second weakest feature is trying to find a location. DeLorme forces you through a convoluted procedure. And finding an address seems to take forever.The absolute worst feature is trying to create a route on the PDA. It is frustrating, time consuming and, in my experience, almost never works.Finally, DeLorme's map information is incorrect and doesn't seem to be updated. The 2004 version didn't note that the street I live on is one-way and it constantly routed me going the wrong way. It sill does.Actually using the product is a nightmare. The representation of your GPS location on the Palm TX's 320 x 480 screen is so tiny as to be invisible, virtually impossible to quickly see in a moving vehicle. Not a good situation. The display does not stay centered. One moment your GPS locator is squarely in the center of the screen. The next, it is at the top of the screen. Then the bottom or the sides. There is no uniformity.The product allows you to set waypoints in order to customize your route. You literally have to do that on the computer rather than the PDA, because the PDA maps are simply too cumbersome to work with. You can do a reverse route on the PDA. Wouldn't you expect that if you simply reverse the route you created, that the waypoints you inserted would be considered? Logic says yes; DeLorme says no. Recalculating a route took almost 15 minutes on the Palm and resulted in a hodgepodge of side streets being included. Since I didn't follow the recommended (and very strange) reverse route, the program simply stopped posting the GPS location to the map. Apparently if you aren't following a pre-determined route, you are out of luck.I'm finished with DeLorme. Never again.Jerry"

28145,1,"The reason why Bonynge's recordings with the National Symphony are so magnificent, especially his performance of opera overtures, is because he was married to the great soprano Joan Sutherland. He conducted numerous opera performance of hers, so he has an inate sense of what live theatre sound should sound like. He operates from the perspective of a live conductor performing for a live audience expecting a big and dramatic sound without the advantage of an acoustically perfect recording studio. And in this Nutcracker performance you get his rich and powerful sound for this storied ballet.I am constantly amazed to see the Dorati performance with the Detroit Symphony get more notice than this one. There's no comparison. And the difference is clear in the final Apotheosis scene. Dorati and the Detroit Symphony rush through it and give it an abrupt ending. Bonynge and the National Symphony however draw it out with all the boom and crash of the cymbals, as we expect from Tchaikovsky's music, to extract the maximum emotional intensity possible. This is exactly what I would expect from a conductor grounded in live theatre performances."

25240,0,"I have been a loyal user of Symantec's Norton SystemWorks for several years now. When I upgraded to Windows XP, I bought this new version of Norton SystemWorks to go with it without any hesitation. Unfortunately, I was dissapointed by a number of things.First off, let me tell you what I liked. Norton AntiVirus is still the best of the breed virus protection you can buy. It automatically configures itself to protect you not only from viruses hidden in files and downloads, but it will also scan both your incoming and outgoing e-mail. By scanning the outgoing e-mail, it prevents you from spreading viruses like Melissa without even knowing it. Nice touch.Live Update is also a top notch feature. Live Update will check for updates such as virus definitions and program updates in the background and automatically apply them. No user input needed. Symantec could not have made it simpler.Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of new features in Norton SystemWorks 2002. In fact, if you use Norton SystemWorks 2002 on a Windows NT/2000 or Windows XP machine, you will find several features missing. Two features I really miss are the Optimization Wizard in Norton Utilities and the Registry Sweep in Norton CleanSweep. Symantec does not tell you that these features do not work on Windows NT/2000/XP until after you have purchased the product.Perhaps sensing that there was not a lot of new features to justify an upgrade, Symatec has included Roxio's GoBack which can help you revert your system to an earlier state should you run into a problem. This feature is totally uncessary for users of Windows Me or Windows XP since Microsoft includes the System Restore feature that accomplishes the same thing. In fact, many of the features in Norton SystemWorks 2002 are already included in newer versions of Windows (such as disk defragmenters and uninstallers).Given this, there may not be a lot of reason to buy Norton SystemWorks 2002. Most people really only need the Norton AntiVirus component which can be purchased cheaper as a standalone.Overall, Norton SystemWorks 2002 is still a quality product, but there is just not a lot of reasons to justify an upgrade."
28514,1,My four year old boy twins can not get enough of this game. It has taught them to have responsibility for their real animals and has helped them to have tons of creative play away from the computer. We are always blow drying our stuffed animals hair now! They have been playing Pet Shop for over a year now and are never bored of it. I highly recommend it for kids who love animals.
63753,0,"TurboTax was easy to use for federal and state taxes. In order to complete the process, it required an update of the TurboTax software. On my Mac running OS X 10.3, downloading this update on line did not work, it just ran and ran. TurboTax technical help indicated another source of updates on their web page. After downloading these updates, they were not processed successfully either. I had to print the forms and mail them in, rather than file electronically. This is in direct opposition to IRS initiatives to encourage electronic filing.In my opinion, TurboTax is a flawed product, at least on a Mac."

64532,1,"Message in a Haunted Mansion is the third Nancy Drew game, and far superior compared to the first two. This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal ""Nancy Drew case formula"". It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as ""there must always be four suspects"" and ""there must always be a long-lost treasure"".Rose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?The plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first ""haunted house"" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.I will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.Even though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.The graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.The characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a s&eacute;ance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic d&eacute;cor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.;One wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.The music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the d&eacute;cor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.Message in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time."
39965,0,"I was looking for cook book software to enter all of my recipes into. I read all the reviews on all the different packages and non of them sounded perfect, one would crash due to errors, another was sold to another company and was only being supported so I decided to order the Joy of Cooking software and try it since there were no reviews and it wasn't too expensive. The recipes are great and modern so I will keep the CD for that but I will not waste my time entering my own recipes. Entering the recipes is like typing them on a recipe card, there is no nutritional analysis and I couldn't find a way to print my own book. If you are hoping this will allow you to organize your own recipes, don't buy it. If you want good recipes on your computer and not have to look up a book, I recommend it."

62444,1,"I had some fragmented files that would hang my &quot;defrag system tool&quot; on windows. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out which files were the main culprit. The reason I needed to find out which files were fragmented, was so I could locate them and hopefully delete them because Windows defrag would &quot;hang&quot; when trying to defrag these files. To make a long story short, DISKKEEPER 6.0, bypassed the damaged files, and defraged the rest of my hard drive, while I contend with how I will delete the fragmented files. Because DISKKEEPER 6.0 is an &quot;outside utility&quot;, the defraged files didn't hang the process of defraging the rest of my of drive. DISKKEEPER also pointed out the files that were fragmented by giving me the DIRECTORY AND PATH, so that I can locate those files and delete them!! Excellent tool and utility! Buy it now, it will save you plenty of headaches! Way faster than Windows defrag tool by MILES!!!!"
34039,1,"One of the best Nancy Drew games I have played so far. The setting and game play were very good. Also there were no annoying repetitive tasks that had to be done over and over, such as cooking food 50 times in the white wolf. My only objection was that the metal/magnent puzzle was not designed well, it is far too sensitive. Overall, a fun game."
18340,0,"My daughter is only 3 so she loves this game. She doesn't play it very often but enjoys it when she does. I think its a slow moving and boring game. If you don't have a super fast computer it makes it even more slow and boring. She is only 3 and she found all of the pets very quickly but since she's young and likes repetition, she still enjoys it. I think that if your daughter is young and is a true pet and Barbie lover, she will get a lot of enjoyment out of this game for a short time."

I had seen this software many times but just thought it was another one of those coloring book kind of things that just about every kid web site has - for free. So I broke down and bought it. Now I can't wait for my son to go to bed at night so I can ""play"" with this software. It's wonderful! It has elements of Powerpoint (slideshows - even the frame timing and sounds), Photoshop (filters like blur, noixe, pixelate, render, adjustments like brightness, contrast and even color filters!), word processors (adding text in installed fonts, sizing), vector programs (like Illustrator that allow you to place a vector image (clipart) and resize), and even hundreds of music selections/genres, clipart, scenery, artwork, textures, patterns, maps, and it will even read the text he types in. I obviously highly recommend this product."

58624,1,"I recently updated my Garmin Street Pilot 2620 to Ver 8 from Ver 6 and encountered some inconsistencies with existing waypoints, destinations, and certain freeway exits. Finally discovered that all points on version 8 are actually about 150 ft North of where the software thinks you are.This may not be a major problem to most users, but have found that if your destination is 100-200 ft north of a cross street, it will not tell you to make the last turn. Also, when driving West on freeways in Southern California with carpool lanes, the software positions you in the carpool lane (even if you are in the far right lane)and gives you exit information based on the carpool rather then the regular lanes. This is sometimes incorrect since in certain locations, the carpool lane exits to the right while the regular lanes exit to the left (4 lanes off)Since I use the unit for extensive motorhome traveling throughout the country, I now have to question all exit information when traveling East or West on freeways or divided streets. This is a pain.Sent e-mail to Garmin regarding this, but so far no response."

70056,1,"I've only used the trial of this program, but it looks mostly good, I'm probably going to buy it.In the trial, you can't burn or create menus, as that part of the program (EZProducer) isn't included in the trial. You can download PowerProducer as a separate trial from Cyberlink, which lets you create menus and burn DVDs, but this product wouldn't even play the MPEG created by Power Director. When you buy PowerDirector, EZProducer (which I believe is a lite version of PowerProducer), comes with it. PowerProducer is a program similar in functionality to Ulead DVD Movie Factory, minus some features, plus some other stuff.The good points of Power Director - It combines the stability of Ulead with most of the features of Pinnacle. (I say most of because the produce movie/create menus part of it resembles Ulead Video Studio- ie you need to render the entire movie as an MPEG first and then create your menus after in a different program)It also has the following advantages over Pinnacle (based on my use of studio 8)Scene detection is only done when you choose to, not when opening the video file which is what Pinnacle does, causing my system to freeze.You can adjust the colour/brightness contrast easily for each separate scene.More animated titles to choose from.It doesn't crash all the time.It doesn't have any other issues unlike Pinnacle which has hundreds of them.It has the following advantages over Ulead VideoStudio 6:Ability to detect scenes even if you haven't selected the ""detect scenes"" option when capturing the video.More flexible in what you can do with layout of scenes.More flexible with titles & timeline features.More easy to use than VideoStudio.It has the following disadvantages:Menu creating/burning functionality is not intuitive at all - When producing the movie, for compression settings you need to look at the ""remainder"" value shown and ensure it's below 4.7GB and I only found this out by guessing. You need to burn a ""High Quality DVD"" in order for the width/height values to be the correct proportions, and then you can change the compression so that your whole movie fits on the disc, again, not very easy to work out. Once you've ""produced"" the movie, the menu creation is performed in ""EzProduer"" or ""PowerProducer"". I tried using ""power producer"" but it wouldn't even play the video file.However, you can then use another program, such as Ulead DVD Movie Factory (which I already own) to create the menus and burn the disc.Please note:I have not tried the capture options in the program, I had already captured the video using Ulead DVD Movie Factory. My trial of the program started when I opened the captured files in power director and ended when I ""produced"" the video files as a single mpeg as a seperate file on my computer (without menus yet)"

The visual quality is good, but using the keyboard does not work for me. It's pretty challenging, and sometimes I can't even jump right so I fall a million times. In the attic in Level One, I tried so hard to get to the sheep but I kept falling, so I gave up after like 30 tries. Seriously, this game is starting to give me a headache.

There are no new drivers or firmware available for either of my drives and the previous Easy CD Creator version seemed to work fine. Although Roxio answered all my e-mails promptly, I still have not been able to get the new version fixed. I think they have a form letter that they send to everyone who complains of having problems. They should get the problems fixed and send out a fix disk to all the people that bought and registered Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum. The program over all is easy to use if you can ignore/work around the problems. As a rule software manufacturers can not test the software on every configuration or type of computer. This is what the customer is for."

79747,0,"Found a review &quot;Quicken to Turbotax Import and tech support slipping&quot; that truly reflects my feelings. I too have used Quicken and Turbox for some time and notice the products had some major problems this year. This year's Quicken had a problem if your net worth graph was set for longer than one year (would exceed memory and data was no longer recoverable) and this year's Turbox will not import the Quicken data. On the Quicken problem, the tech support alerted me so I was able to further avoid the problem. Tech support also alerted me on the TurboTax problem and update may be out soon. Of course, if it doesn't come in December, I won't be able to get a rough estimate of taxes before years end - in time to do something about it.I really felt that if the company knows of a problem (like the Quicken one last summer), they should post the workaround on the web until the update is ready. Would have really saved me from constantly going to backups and updating again."
39325,1,"Ok, the product does what it claims. It cleaned up a bunch of crap from my computer the first time I used it. It cleared out 334 invalid regisrty items and 1753 temp files, recovering a total of 3658.82 mb.I used another cleaner before, sumthin sumthin Mechanic. That thing totally screwed up my computer immediately after using it by crashing to a blue screen. Wincleaner, however had no adverse affect on my computer at all.Why only 4 stars instead of 5? Three reasons.1. The packaging itself says ""rated 5 stars"" on Amazon.com. Oooo, I was impressed. What it does not say was that it was based on only one review. (Probably written by someone associated with the manufacturer, I'm sure.)Smack! Come on now. Not an untrue statement on the box, but a misleading one. Sneaky, sneaky.2. The uninstaller feature on this product is useless. It is no better than the ""add/remove"" function your computer already has for uninstalling programs. Those so-called stubborn or hard to remove programs remain stubborn and hard to remove as this feature of Wincleaner doesn't get them...at least it didn't do so on my computer.3. Ehhh....in a whiny voice....The price could be a little bit lower in my opinion.However, I still must say, overall, the product is a good one.

Not even in the manual!-your ""friends"" (whoever you're not playing with) are so slow in following you and are almost always occupied with sneezing or wandering around when you need help so badly!-I tried to install this game for one full year and never got it to install until I did some tricky thingsOverall, I would have rated this game five stars if the bad things were fixed.I think that EA Games was just porting over a Play Station game (I can tell by the graphics style) and not bothering to make it anymore convenient. EA did a poor job here. I would sort of recommend this game."
64380,0,"This product is reliable, works great, and has the best user interface of the products I've tried. It almost gets a five star rating, except for one problem that is associated with the way my family uses Windows XP.This review is for Windows users who utilize the ""switch user"" option... Rather than logging off entirely, a user suspends his/her session to allow another user to log in to the same computer (this makes re-entry to the computer much faster than logging in). Unfortunately, ZoneAlarm posts its alerts to all active users (including to those that have ""switched""). Therefore, ALL USERS get the the same alerts that have to be acknowledged on ALL USER accounts. I contacted Zone Labs and they indicated that this is by design and recommended that my family completely log out of accounts to prevent this. We like the ""Switch User"" feature and are not willing to give it up.On the positive side, the pros outweigh the cons and (so far) I am willing to live with this problem, hoping that the issue will be fixed in future releases.

3004,1,"I have more to say about this great program. I tried out 3 childrens/beginners chess programs on my 5-year old daughter:1. Maurice Ashley Teaches Chess2. Fritz and Chesster 1 & 23. Dinosaur ChessThe first 2 programs were written for older children and were too difficult for my daughter to grasp. Maurice Ashley Teaches Chess is for beginners ages pre-teen to adult (10+). It's an excellent piece of software, but my daughter can't read just yet so it is way above her head. If I sit next to her and guide her through the program's mini-games and activities she can pick things up, but I definitely have to sit down next to her and navigate through it the whole time. The Fritz and Chesster series are also excellent chess software for kids. But even Part I is too advanced for my 5-year old. It targets children ages 8-13, and it really does not teach chess in a pedagogical way. One has to wade through a long narrative and some non-chess related activities to learn the game of chess.Dinosaur Chess targets 4-7 year olds and teaches the game of chess in a standard pedagogical way, where chess knowledge is presented in bite-sized portions from the basic building blocks to the most complicated concepts. In addition, all of the mini-games and activities are directly related to chess. Most importantly, my daughter can go through the chess lessons without me being present. Dinosaur chess is the best chess software for younger kids.Dadi Jonnson has written a splendid review on Dinosaur Chess on ChessOK Cafe that you should look up and read."

31370,0,I bought this game and thought that it would be simple but it is not. It didn't work very well on my computer and my PC is only a year old. It would have been fun if I could have saved my cartoons because it is a very long and sometimes tedious job to make a cartoon. Overall it was worth the $3 I spent on it but it wasn'i quite what I had expected.
77373,1,"I'm speaking this review from my software that I just received about two hours ago. It was easy to train, and quickly picked up all the technical words I use in my therapy practice. It even picked up people's names and drug names and symptom names that I really thought I would have a lot of trouble programming into it. I bought what was probably the original about eight years ago and it was just more trouble than it was worth. But this is absolutely fantastic. I got the ""preferred"", I have Windows XP. An older, crappy laptop, and I don't even have the amount of RAM I'm supposed to have to use it. I bought it used it and and am using it with an upgraded microphone that is more comfortable and probably higher quality. Already it's been worth every penny, and I'm so glad I got it. I've been e-mailing people I haven't talked to in a long time because I hate typing so much. Try it you'll love it!"

32538,1,"I am not a real space fan but I saw this DVD in a store a couple of days ago and decided to buy it. After watching this DVD, I regret not seeing this documentary in the IMAX Theater. This documentary gives you an intimate look from the astronauts and cosmonauts' point of view that visited and lived on the International Space Station. You get an experience that is visually completely out of this world and an inside view of what goes on in the International Space Station (and how it was build). The views, footage, and image quality are absolutely breathtaking, both inside and outside the space station. Way better than the regular footage you see on TV. My advice however is to look at this DVD at night in complete darkness. The camera work the astronauts and cosmonauts did is amazing. This is also the first time I looked at the whole documentary over again but with the audio commentary which was very interesting to listen to. I also looked at all the bonus features. This inside look at the International Space Station on this DVD is truly amazing and something I will probably never experience."
31557,1,I've had no problems with installation or scanning process. It works fine for me. I have no idea why so many people have given negative reviews here.My only complaint is that it doesn't fix adware (which btw norton claims is a non-viral threat).
8314,1,"This is a really good Spanish language learning program. I bought this to help me study for my college Spanish course and it helped a lot. The two parts of the program A+ Spanish and Spanish Before You Know It work perfectly together. A+ Spanish gave me 15 lessons in Spanish on my computer and really gave me a good basis of understanding the Spanish Language. Spanish Before You Know It saved me on studying for those tests. It is a flashcard program that contains thousands of Spanish vocabulary words in different categories. With these two tools I was able to comprehend and learn way more Spanish than I thought I could. I would recomend this program to anyone who wants to learn to Spanish for any reason- business, school, travel ect."
39637,1,"Deus Ex is a wonderful game unlike anything before it. Its amazing, unexpected, and twisting plot is twenty times as compelling as most of the pathetic, cliched, excuses for movies that hollywood cranks out. It has a level of open-endedness that surpasses any game before it. Unlike other open-ended games like The Sims, or Everquest, Deus Ex ties its story together with goals and a way that you can actually win the game. Speaking of winning, Deus Ex has 3 different endings, the choosing of which is up to you. Over the course of the game, many characters who you may even become attached to, can live or die directly based on your actions. The only problem that I have with this otherwise stupendous game is the substandard graphics. However, given the game's age, this is to be expected. There is no wrong way to play Deus Ex. You can choose to fight from the shadows, you can fight head on, you can simply sneak and avoid combat. The possibilities are limitless. Based on how you play the game, you can choose different abilities, weapons, augmentations (these are like super powers). Based on your style of play, innocents may die, enemies may live and the outcome of the world may be changed. Over 4 years since its release, Deus Ex continues to be a revolutionary experience that paves new ground for the future of video games. Forget Half Life. This is the best game ever created and deserves every bit of its Game of The Year 2000 award. Given its age, you can probably pick it up for under $15. You'll be glad you did, because Deus Ex is more than a game. It's an experience."
1692,0,"It does not have all the bells and whistles that other more expensive products have but for the price it can't be beat!I used it on a 3300 mile RV trip with our laptop and it worked well considering its limitations. A person does need some patience when starting out using it.It is very accurate and can reroute when needed but not as fast as other navigational units. It does not allow map updates, so what you see is what you get but if you want a starter unit that works with a laptop I would recommend it. You will need a co-driver in order to use while driving as finding and changing functions is somewhat slow, otherwise you need to stop along the road to use the mouse pad. An advantage of a laptop is the availability of a large screen.The thing I did not like particularily is when choosing shortest route in or near a city it will find the shortest route but at the expense of taking more time and making lots of turns on all types of streets and roads, but it is accurate!"

92528,0,"""Monster-In-Law"" is not the train wreck I was expecting, but it could've been so much more.Charlie (Jennifer Lopez) works a series of temp jobs and enjoys everything she does, making ends meet. It makes life interesting. One day, she meets Kevin (Michael Vartan), a doctor, and they quickly fall in love. Kevin's Mom is Viola Fields (Jane Fonda), a successful Barbara Walters-like network news anchor, with problems of her own. Kevin brings Charlie to his mother's estate to meet her. Kevin decides to propose, in front of his mother. Viola clearly disapproves and sets about breaking them up. As she and Ruby (Wanda Sykes), her assistant, set a series of events in motion, Charlie gradually begins to realize what she is working against and fights back.""Monster-In-Law"", directed by Robert Luketic (""Legally Blond"", ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!""), frequently veers into sitcom territory.The acting is very broad and cartoonish. At one point, Charlie, having pulled one off on Viola, shakes her head and sniggers, much like a Hanna Barbera cartoon character. Lopez's character is all over the place. At one moment, she appears to be normal and caring and sympathetic, the other, she is acting like Peg Bundy from ""Married with Children"". Fonda, returning to feature films after 15 years, is clearly having fun chewing the scenery. And it is fun to watch her. But she is so over the top and Lopez is over the top only part of the time, that it seems like a bad sitcom. Wanda Sykes is very funny as Ruby. Her natural allegiance is with Viola, someone she has worked with for years, maybe decades, but she isn't beyond dressing down her boss, pointing out the problems with her theories. When she realizes that this isn't going to stop her boss, and Charlie is a stronger adversary, she begins to root a little for her. Michael Vartan (from TVs ""Alias"") is a very handsome guy, but he is virtually non-existent in this film. He is such a flat, boring character that he gets completely lost in the wake of Hurricane Fonda and Tropical Storm Lopez.The film would've worked better if the two lead actresses were more complimentary. As Fonda chews the scenery, Lopez moves from trying to portray a real woman to matching the overblown antics of her co-star. It might have been more successful if one of the two were cartoonish while the other was more natural. Providing more balance to the proceedings. Or, if they were equally outlandish. As it is, the film seems unbalanced. Strange.This sort of story naturally lends itself to a darker tone, but the filmmakers have steered clear of that. If the story moves slightly towards ""dark territory"", it quickly veers back into the safe and sunny territory everyone feels was necessary to earn the film mass acceptance. At one point, Viola is so fed up with Charlie that she is about to smash up some almonds and slip them into Charlie's food. Earlier, Charlie remarked that she was allergic to nuts. Ruby talks her out of it. Why does she have to talk Viola out of it? The story sets up that Viola is more than a little egomaniacal, more than a little crazy, more than a little excessive. It seems like her character would go through with something like this, no matter what. They pull Viola back because they want her to remain sympathetic, for the sappy, sweet ending.I did laugh. More than I expected to. Much of this laughter was created by Wanda Sykes. Ruby is the type of all-knowing character every lead used to have. Think Thelma Ritter in the 50s. A couple of her one-liners made me laugh out loud.Because the filmmakers pull the punches, they rob the film of any dark humor and relegate it to the annals of forgettable comedies on the shelf of every video store throughout the country.From all of the horrible reviews I have read, I was expecting ""Monster-In-Law"" to be completely dreadful. I was surprised that I found myself laughing at the absurd situations. Certainly worth checking out on video, but a bargain matinee is pushing it."
14475,1,"This game is well designed, bright, colorful and attractive. It captured and continues to captivate its 7-year old user - he loves the game-like challenges and learns and hones the fundamentals of chess along the way, on his terms. The fairy-tale characters are likable and credible and guide the student nicely through the mazes of the fairy tale story and the real game of chess. They use proper and correct English. Most speak American, one speaks a highly cultured but pleasant and unstilted form of British. As students acquire skills the program rewards them with access to new games and with periodic promotions; and as they accomplish specific tasks they are sometimes celebrated for them - complete with music and flowers. Kids just love challenges and positive feedback - and this program excels at both."
89608,1,"Go ahead and pinch yourself. I said it, Stable and Microsoft together. Until I started using Windows 2000, I didn't think that there was such a thing. Well, the next NT product is. Buyers beware though, it is very tough to find drivers for a lot of todays hardware. Also, this isn't a product for most consumers. It is a lot more difficult to navigate too. Once you get the hang of it though, it is pretty awesome. I particularly had trouble with getting my computer to view things on my lan and getting on the internet. But after a little tweaking and a lot of crossing my fingers, it is working quite flawlessly. Some changes that I appreciated are a hardware wizard and in the Add/Remove Programs it tells you how often a program is used. On the other hand, I didn't like the way that the Network and Network Properties pages are setup. Also, Dual Booting is quite easy to do now and the installation is pretty smooth also. Novices beware, but advanced user will enjoy it after they get all their hardware/drivers working."
71510,0,"Crystal Reports 8.5 provides a lot of features for designing reports on top of a relational database system and as far as consumer-tier goes, it's a fine product. Charts are pretty easy to use, the macro language is fairly powerful (and intuitive), and it's very easy to lay out items on the report.There are several annoying problems with it:1. During upgrade from a previous version, the installer removed the previous version, then complained it couldn't find a certain file needed to &quot;prove&quot; this was an upgrade. After reinstalling the previous version and repeating the process a couple of times, I found a workaround on the Seagate web site. Ugh... this shouldn't happen.2. The table linker is nice, but it is more primative than the one in Microsoft Access. For example, if I'm joining three fields from table &quot;foo&quot; to table &quot;bar,&quot; and I make one of those joins a &quot;right join&quot; then the others two parts of the table join should default to this. They don't and it errors out. I feel the tool could be easier to use.3. On several occasios the query tool got hopelessly confused. It was often easier to write a custom view or macro query on SQL Server (or Oracle) than it was to use the reporting front end. The problem I have with this is it makes my particular installation harder to do because in addition to just shipping a standalone report, I have to ship a SQL query. I wish there were a way for me to reliably tell it &quot;I KNOW what I'm doing... ust send the query as I've typed it to the database.&quot;4. Occasionally when a query had problems with it and I attempted to preview the report, it would go into &quot;infinite loop&quot; mode. The only way out of this was to use Windows to &quot;kill&quot; the program. Quite frequently, I'd have crw32.exe just crash on its own when accessing a SQL database."
18582,0,"I have been using Quicken since 1994. Only draw back / problem I have had with the product is its lack of ""forward looking"" capabilities in the area of Budgeting and Cash Forecasting. I was excited about the apparent future looking cash forecast capability of Quicken 2004 Home &amp; Business. However, after using it / testing it extensively, I found it to be buggy. That is, it produces a result with extensive calculation errors. It was difficult to get Quicken support's attention on this matter. I finally got an answer, after attempting to get a relevant response from Quicken for better than 10 weeks, and it appears the identified bug does not have enough priority to get fixed. If there are greater problems than this one (problems which get the higher priority) I'm a bit concerned about what additional product errors are there which the user is unaware. However, my testing and detailed checking hasn't identified any additional out and out computation errors. I would advise users to check the results from the planning features carefully for reasonableness.In summary, Quicken Home &amp; Business 2004 seems to be ok for looking back, looking where you spent your money (rear view mirror)... but use caution when looking to the future.Also, I found technical support much more difficult to use / to get now than it was in past years. I contacted Quicken no less than 8 times and got incorrect and / or bad information from their call center which I expect is Off shored to India based on the three phone calls I had with them. Communication was difficult and frankly two of the individuals who tried to help me didn't understand this area of Quicken at all. I was finally transferred to a very articulate English speaking support person who explained that this bug has been given a very low priority and that it is likely that this bug will not be addressed.This review sounds more negative that I intended. On balance Quicken is a good software package. Although I am very disappointed that Quicken does not work in this area, I am not aware of any other product that provides this cash flow forecasting capability. I will continue to use Quicken because, other than this feature, I think the software works well and is among the best out there."

My son is very proficient on the computer and easily does Tonka Construction 1 and 2, Tonka Garage, and Tonka Search and Rescue but this program is not only difficult for him but it is even difficult for me and his 12 year old brother. My son still loves Tonka Joe but I am very surprised in the difference in products and was considering Tonka Raceway but now I may even reconsider that purchase."

50458,0,"I bought this software over a year ago to edit video from my Sony Digital 8 camera.Installation:It took me close to 3 months to setup because of issues between Windows ME and the included FireWire card. I actually had to hack the Microsoft drivers .INF file to get the card to work properly on my system.User InterfaceThe software is amazing easy to use. The user interface is very intuitive.To capture, hookup your Digital camcorder to the Firewire card with the included cable. You just say you want to record and up to 15 minutes of video is transfered at a time. This is due to a limit in the size of AVI files.The system is capable of automatically sensing scene breaks, so when it captures, it automatically organizes scenes.For editing, it just have to arrange the scenes. You can also shorten the scenes through again a very good UI.The software has 3 voice tracks. You can easily add music from MP3s or CDs to your video. You can also do voiceovers ( I haven't tried this yet ).If you are making DVDs, you can add chapters and menus. The UI for doing this is pretty good as well.You can also add stills. I've made many videos which are combination of video and stills pictues from a digital cameraThe software comes with many transitions. You can do fads and other cool effects.You can output your movie to DVD, S-VCD, VCD, RealNetworks, Microsoft Media Player Format, or MPEG ( No Quicktime support ).Now the bad: The software has been very unreliable, at times, I lost hours of work. Anyone who looks at the message boards will see that the user base of this software is generally unhappy. I seem to finally have a patch that has made the software reasonable reliable. I can honestly say that I love the software but have never been so frustrated with the qauality of a piece of software before. When it works its really good, but it doesn't always work.Because of the unreliability of the software, I would not recommend it to a computer novice."
25137,1,"After already being fed up with Nortons incompetence, their 2007 edition was the final blow to their self destruction. I had to dump Norton because of so many problems which would take several pages to describe.I investigated the various benchmarks and reviews and decided on Kaspersky. I am absolutely impressed by this software. It was written by INTELLIGENT !!! people, & not by some nerds that are to stupid to kick over a bucket of water. The startup is faster. The updates are very fast. Their scanning for viruses will detect if the systems is busy and will pause the scanning until it is less busy. Meaning, that when you are using your machine, YOU, not the Internet Security has the highest priority. The way they handle the spam and popup is again very smartly written. This software was written by truly professionals with a high IQ.They thought about everything. I am a senior software engineer and I hate stupid software such as Nortons, with totally unnecessary messages which only serves to irritate you and slow you down. Kaspersky, congratulations for a job well done. This is the best on the market !!"

What was happening in Microsoft's usability department when they were testing this software? Can someone post some of the transcripts like ""AGHGH! This is awful!

42877,1,"Microsoft Office is essential software for your home or office. This version is a great upgrade for the Office Suite. It features some great updates to the interface of the Suite, as well as new capabilities and even one new program. One of the major changes to Office is the new ""Ribbon."" The old menus have given way to a new feature called the ribbon, which arranges tasks around how you use them, rather than the function-based menus in previous versions of Office. The menus offer the interface to be customized further.This version of Office also offers the ability to create visually stunning documents with ease. I love how I can create a professional looking document in minutes with all of the new backgrounds and templates. The interface now looks clean and very stylish. There are even new fonts to choose from. The new version of Office saves documents as a .docx file, but you can easily convert to and from older versions of Office with ease. If a format you choose is won't convert, the software will alert you and allow you to save it in a compatible version.I need Word, PowerPoint, and Excel for my uses, but in this version of Office, Outlook is replaced with a new program called One Note. One Note is a great alternative software to Word for producing informal documents, such as taking notes, or making to do lists. I use one note in my classes to write down notes from lectures. It even has a built in voice recorder for audio notes right on the spot. The notes can be written anywhere on the page and can be moved around on the fly. One Note is like a virtual notebook. The more I use it, the more I wondered how I lived without it!Overall, I enjoy the changes that have been made to Office in the 2007 version. The retail version comes with three licenses, which means that it can be installed on three different computers at one time. I wish they had given a little more warning to the differences between the new file types and the old, but overall, this is a good upgrade."

They provide no substantial documentation either in the box or on their website. Since I work in this field, I was able to figure it out on my own, but you're probably better off shelling out a few more bucks for 'Black Ice Defender' or 'Norton Personal Firewall'. As for the actual software, it seems to work fine and has most of the standard features for firewall software in this price range. Overall, it's a good package for anyone looking for simple protection for their home systems and will keep all but the serious hackers out."
74231,2,"I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since I purchased the Compaq Presario 4000. The reason I have stuck with Norton because this Presario came with Norton Internet Security 2002 attached to it. I never used the NIS 2002, though, but I purchased the Norton Anti-Virus (NAV) 2003 which I have bee using for the last three years. In fact I used the NAV 2004 for two straight years without any response from Symantec, then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by Symantec. I liked the NAV 2005 (which Symantec six months prior to its due date subscription, which made me mad and hence my wanting to try NIS at a subsidized rate) because like NAV 2003, it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer. It is after purchasing and trying NIS 2005, that I realized how low and base Norton can go with its software. First when I tried NIS 2005, it blocked all my websites. I couldnt access them and I could not read my e-mail (Whenever I tried to read my e-mail, the response would be that, that action has been cancelled). So I reformatted my hard drive and the NIS 2005 appeared to be working quite well until I tred to install Adobe Reader 7.08 and couldn't allow me to proceed. Moreover, it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another. So I uninstalled NIS 2005 and installed NAV 2006, which appears to be working well. I have now purchased Tend Micro PC-cillin 2006 as well as McAfee Viruscan 2006 at subsidized rates, should Symantec pematurely terminate my NAV 2006 prematurely i.e. before the 366 days of subscription are over. I think one of the reasons why NIS could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew. It tried to be an anti-virus, personal firewall, privacy control, antispam as well as parental control in one. It reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from the radio, since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player. I think Norton Internet Security is in that mode. It is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam,anti-spyware at the same time. Hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program. At this stage, I would stay away from any program that calls itself ""Internet Security."" I may try Trend Micro internet Security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users, but that will be if something goes wrong with my current NAV 2006. Otherwise, I am still wary of those programs that pass off as ""Internet Security"" such as ""Norton Internet Security"" or ""Trend Micro Internet Security,"" pending their perfection of this technology at some future date."
14598,1,"I must say that Front Page 2002 is a dream program compared to the 2000 version. I had some very weird things happen with 2000 such as its not publishing to the web on the index page unless I also saved it in Notepad. All the bugs are gone in 2002 plus it is much easier to use. I use it for everything, rarely using Word, Office and so forth. My two major tools for editing and writing are Front Page and super Notepad instead. I am going to learn Dreamweaver next term at the college where I teach because I am finally ready to move on and learn more about professional web design. Besides, I can now read and write html so I am not as utterly dependent on Front Page as I once was. If you don't know any html coding, the basis of all web pages, Front Page is the program for you. I also do all my image editing in Photoshop so don't even need that function in Front Page. Dreamweaver is the industry standard instead of Front Page yet Front Page is the ordinary user's program of choice. The reason for this is that you can know very little about computers and still make a website with Front Page. It even made publishing websites idiot proof by using Front Page Server extensions with many web host providers. Thus, one can totally skip learning ftp protocol by using Front Page server extensions instead. If someone wants to go professionally into web page design, this is not the product, Dreamweaver is. People who already are professionals in the computer industry or in web design tell me they don't like Front Page. I think the reason is that since they don't need (or want) Front Page to do their work for them, they desire a program which gives them a much freer hand. For the average computer user though, that is all pie in the sky, beyond their reach, and Front Page 2002 will more than do the job for them."

71056,1,"My 4 year old sat down for the first time with this software at 3PM this past Saturday afternoon, and aside for a quick break for dinner (which was wolfed down because she wanted to get back to her ""'puter""), she played non-stop until past 8PM.Learning her numbers, addition, phonics, grammar, following instructions (Tigger's Treasure Hunt is great!)...you name it. I can't think of a single problem with this software. There are even 3 levels of difficulty within most of the games.Was not as impressed with the Mickey Mouse disk, but only one real quibble, really. On the spash screen where you can choose what game to play, the Pooh Bear disk says what each game is when you hover your mouse over it...so you know what it is even if you're pre-reading. The Mickey Mouse game does not. The rest was just fine...and fine-tuning her listening/observation skills with the bell-hop game (hotel guests call the front desk asking for a bell-hop with blue pants, bowtie and no hat, and you have to choose the right bell-hop from what looks like the Goof Troop) is a WELL thought out game.Am DEFinitely recommending it to anyone with a 3-5 year old."
81692,1,"Dragon seems to be an undiscovered tool. It allows me to dictate consultation notes and business letters in copious quantities without the expense of a typist or what would surely turn into a carpal tunnel syndrome. It's faster than using a typist as the turnaround time is instant.It's not perfect. I frequently have to use the mouse and the keyboard for absolute accuracy, but it beats typing by far. You can train unusual words in no time. It's only 99 dollars and worth a shot. You have to have a computer of greater than 750 mH with at least 128 RAM."
83402,1,I purchased this program for my 5 year old and it was great...the software does so many things as an adult I could play with it for hours...you won't regret buying it.
61059,1,"AutoRoute Europe has the same functionality, look, and feel as Microsoft Streets and Trips which I have used with good results for several years. AutoRoute also works with the GPS sensor I purchsed previously with Streets and Trips. I have already used AutoRoute to plan some of our summer European vacation and it works exactly as expected. The fact that AutoRoute and Streets and Trips use the same icon leads to a little confusion on the tool bar, but maps that are saved from the respective programs do open the proper program when they are double-clicked. The only thing that would be better would be for AutoRoute Europe and Streets and Trips to be seemlessly integrated into a single product."
3014,1,I found this tool highly useful to pull together and organize all of my tax information. It's straightforward to use and will help those who are helpless.
86479,1,"Really like the U Point Technology, lots of nice features. Seems to be more pixel oriented in sizing of photos & Crop tool is hard to get a specific inch size. I will use Capture for my RAW work, then Photo ShopCS3"
2016,0,"I just wanted to provide a balance to some of the other reviews below. I currently have two machines running ME.The first was an upgrade from Win-95 two years ago, and I've had little problems with it during that time. The installation was easy. Once I learned to stay away from the Active Desktop, and got a reference on setting up some of the maintenance tasks, using it has been easy (scheduling disk maintenance and such). Since then I've added additional RAM, a CD-R/W, two different printers and several large software packages (such as Front Page and JBuilder) without problems. I might also note that the upgrade solved several problems I was having with slow modem connections. Since upgrading to ME I've never had a problem with currupted anything on this machine.Last weekend I purchased and installed the full version on a second machine. For the last year I had been struggling with various versions of Linux on it, and after getting REALLY frustrated trying to establish a network connection between the two machines I got mad, ran over to BestBuy and purchased ME. Within 4 hours of buying it I was file sharing with the other machine.Now, I'm a programmer by trade, so I don't say it lightly that I was having trouble making Linux work for me as a home OS. I decided that I was spending far to much time trying to get Linux to work rather than using it to develope software, word processing, installing or upgrading packages and other tasks. I get paid for that at work. Windows ME might have its warts, and I wish it would support FrontPage's server features, but for $... you can get a couple of good references for getting around some of the more annoying ones.If you are using an earlier version of Windows, it is well worth the $... to upgrade. I decided NOT to upgrade to or use XP because of some of the many issues surrounding privacy and configuration some people have, which is why this last weekend I purchased the full version of ME instead of XP.It also helps to make sure you include all the patch updates from the MS web site, again a task made easy to do and automate in ME compared to earlier versions of Windows and just plain confusing in Red Hat Linux (I never knew if what I was 'patching' was anything I really needed or not, where as with ME the package updates are clear to read and understand)."
79186,0,"I purchase this item, because I do an internal newsletter for my company. I needed images (preferably photos) as fillers and to add a little punch.I'm not sure what the difference is between this product and Hemera 50,000 Photo Objects Volume I, because the package looked the same. Marketing ploy?Anyhow, you can find almost everything you want. There are several pictures of the same object taken at different angles or the same person taken with different poses or expressions. In otherwords, variety suffers a little. Many of the images were a bit antiquated and some pictures were just (for lack of a better term) downright stupid. For example, there is a man dressed in Colonial-era attire typing on a computer.True, the models are not very attractive or hip looking, but the people in the &quot;business&quot; category are realistic. (My personal favorite is the belly dancers who have a whole lot of belly and not much dancing.)The quality for websites is good; for my electronically mailed newsletter, it was excellent. I even printed it out and the quality was very good. I didn't notice any pixilation.If you are a pro in the big time, this isn't for you (but then you could probably afford your own pics). If you need images for small to medium business use or personal use, this is a good product. If you need images for social club or school publications, this would also be a good product for you."
76399,1,I have been using TurboTax for last 15 yeras to do my taxes.It's very convenient and easy to use.
54915,1,There is no comparison between TurboTax and TaxCut. How can anyone say TaxCut is better??? TurboTax if far superior. If you want to save time and money the only way to go is Turbotax.
30307,1,"This is a very easy to use family tree data base. I was an unwilling participant in family tree gathering information, but the program just drew me in. I have connected with family members I haven't talked to in years just to gather more data to put into the program. The help I received on the phone was wonderful."
63756,1,"I am a first time user of this software, and it worked fine!!I have used various tax software in the past, but Amazon's priceand reputation caused me to use TurboTax this time and I am very satisfied withthe results."
35175,0,"A little confusing. Need to be patient to learn how it all works. Helpful. Interesting.However, it may not be your way of writing a book. But that is okay."
57497,1,"This is the first time I have ever used any security other than Norton. But with the all the unfavorable reviews on Norton decided it was time to change. My husband's new Dell computer came with PC-cillion installed, so thought that was a good recommendation and gave me a chance to see if I would like it before buying. Decided that I did like it and was easy to use. So ordered it and loaded without any problem and I have been able to successfully use it from the start. It is easy to use, doesn't have a couple of the shortcuts Norton has, like one click to identify addressed one wants blocked in their email, but other than that it is great. Works as fast as Norton and seems to do a better job without all the popups. If I can use it anyone can and I definately recommend it."
73532,2,"I gave it a chance, was determined to learn, and finally gave up. It repeated images without translation, and gave no reference on what anything meant. Frustrated, I advanced to the next few lessons to see if I could learn anything at all, and found it useless. Repeating the words through a mic was useless as well, there were some that I repeated perfectly, and the program still wouldn't advance. I think there was a glitch in it. It was truly a waste of money. The advertisers for this product have flooded the market so you will believe its the best thing that ever happened. Well it isn't. I'm having more success with Instant Immersion, at 1/4th the cost. Rosette stone is a scam."
58379,0,"I bought this product after hearing good things about it. I am an amateur web graphics designer and was hoping I could use it for my graphics. I bought it and when I told my friend about it, she bought a copy to, to use to design her graphics. Well, she got the hang of it almost immeadiately but I still can't use it! The tools confuse me and never seem to work right. It also doesn't have brushes like PSP and Photoshop. You can use PSP tubes w/ PIP's stamp tool, but those aren't the same. Photo editing, that's a different story. It has great editing tools that are very easy to use. As an amateur photographer as well, it comes in handy sometimes. But overall, I think I will switch to PSP."
30341,2,I regret buying the product. I bought it direct from Susteen. Had I been smarter I would have tried to get a refund.
56494,1,"This is their best version yet. I only had one small problem with installation. Suggest to new buyers, remove any old Symantec antivirus software completely--go to their web site for details, then install."
93912,0,"Very bloated and kinda buggy. Definitely a bad choice for Windows 2000 users (even with the latest patch from Roxio, still has problems, especially with data CDs). Not even that great for Windows 95/98/ME users. Novices are probably better off with Easy CD 4.03, and users who know what they are doing should check out Nero Burning Rom."
57421,1,"Easy to use, 5 stars reliable. As long as you installed PC-Cillin Internet Security, your PC is totally risk free, no longer need to install any other security softwares. This is my ONLY trusted internet security s/w."
77408,1,"The purpose for buying the Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 Preferred Speech Recognition was to assist me with my writing. In the end, I received so much more. The Dragon forces you to think about what you wanted to write, before you even say the first word. You are forced to speak clearly. It is a very helpful tool. Even my husband, who is much better with words than I am is seriously thinking about getting his own Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 for his own use."
19442,1,"Its good to have and nice to use, but it is a little confusing unless you read the entire manual. I can't really complain."
79229,0,"I installed it on 2 computers. One was an upgrade. One was a clean install. Both have had many complete system lock ups. Both systems seem somewhat unstable, unlike xp which was relatively good for a new os. There are many, many pieces of software that are not ready yet (check Linksys support for only one example). The security is so extreme that a virus looks easy to deal with. Turning off ""user account control"" even they say not to seems to help greatly if you are doing a clean install and have to reinstall a lot of programs. I wish I had waited 6 months or more before doing this."
55556,1,"While I've read the mixed reviews here and at other sites, my experience was positive. It installed easily with no glitches. From some of what I've read, I expected disk doom.It copied a complete hard drive of several partitions from one drive to a larger one. It did this several times faster than the free software included with the drive itself (Seagate.) Seagate's program had no problems but it was ridiculously slow --maybe 30 minutes for 7% of a 4 GB partitiom.That may be a normal speed, but True Image 9.0 was much faster.These were ATA and Ultra ATA drives, so as to SCSI or other drive IO issues, I have no experience. Then too, I'm using the new hard drive right now, so I have no experience with Acronis support, because the product worked flawlessly.I would recommend the program, but care must be taken to be sure you get a good install without antivirus or other programs interfering with the setup.My only idea for improvement would be greater flexibility in the manual setup of partitions. (An original FAT16 partition could not be set up on the new drive as FAT32, even with a separate conversion step.)"
41003,0,"I was having fun with the injector items at first, but then I had a problem on my hands. I couldn't get any of the kits! There is a place near the incubator room (that's where you hatch your eggs) where there is a token about as big as the average norn spinning around with the symbol of the science on it. What do I do with that? I never did find out. Now I'll give you tips on things I found frustrating. First, to get an egg you have to go to the hatchery and double click on the egg you want. The egg will pop up in the incubator room. Then you can hatch it with the incubator. One day I started up the game and my norns (and every other creature) was stuck head first into the ground. I don't know what happend! I hope it doesn't happen to you!"
13686,1,East to install and easy to use. I am very glad I got rid of Norton!
15291,1,"The program is easy to install, as well as use. It asks direct questions which helps you fill out the necessary forms. It affords you to knowledge of changed tax laws, much easier than reading the IRS manuals for filing. Since I am a new user, I am unsure as to how it will help with 2006 taxes, regarding updating the program, etc. Will have to wait and see for that one. For the money, I think this product is well worth it."
29007,1,I work with kids in a school's extended care program. The 4 and 5 yr olds love this game. We had one before that got damaged and no longer worked. I was delighted to find another one was available.
13337,0,"It's hard to say if I liked this SM Professional, It did stop threats, but it also stopped me from using programs I us on a regular basis. It tries to hard to protect your system and seems to do more harm than good sometimes. I never had any serious problems, but I only used it for a few months. It had too many features and options, it got confusing fast. I'm not real good with networking unless its plug and play kind of thing. My video streaming speed increased after UNINSTALLING it.It's like those overprotective parents who wont let their kids outside because they think Sunlight will give their kids skin cancer or something. Also, it would override my startup options, crash flashplayer, block my video codecs, forget about updating your programs, and made it hard to do anything. Also, no matter how often I selected ""Fix all Problems"", I would have to do it again an hour later or see ""Your computer has _ protentail problems"" popup every five min.In my opinion it works but at a huge cost. Get it for your ""E-mail only"" parents or grandparents. Anyone else will find it to restrictive."
20772,1,this program is so neat. i've redone about every room in my house-at least on paper from this program. great price and fun to do.
17170,1,"Based on the negative performance reviews - I almost didn't give Virtual PC a chance.I'm a recent convert to Mac, having spent the last 14 years in PC/UNIX environments. Doing graphics and web development now, I had hoped the move to Mac would be fairly painless - and it has been, with one exception. Two programs that I use significantly are PC-only, and after months of searching, there's just simply not anything on OSX that has the comparable functionality.And, when testing browser compatibility it's just as arrogant for Mac designers to ignore testing on the PC browsers as it is for PC designers to ignore the Mac browsers.So, I was faced with three choices: 1) have a standalone PC for these programs, 2) have a PC but going through a KVM so I could use just one keyboard/mouse/monitor to switch between, or 3) use Virtual PC.Number 1 was out because I just don't want a completely separate setup - and don't have the room. But I was heavily leaning towards #2 simply because it seemed ""right"" to have my two Windows programs running on a Windows box. Plus most of what I had read on Virtual PC made it sound like it would be unusable - it was just too slow.(Un)fortunately, my #2 option above was proving to be a costly affair. A new PC, plus either a DVI switch or a new dual-input monitor was looking to be in the $500+ range. And there were limitations with that too - like no direct interaction between the two machines, not being able to use the Mac and PC at the same time, etc.So, for $129 I decided Virtual PC 7 was worth the shot (I already have a Windows 2000 license from a previous system). The complete setup on my Dual 1.8 G5 (2GB Ram) took about 2 hours. And I was skeptical at best - I've used emulators before and they suck.Wow, was I pleasantly surprised! Not only does stuff (like networking, shared folders and printing) just seem to work, but the performance is perfectly fine for what I'm doing. I can see where someone who was expecting true ""Windows"" top-level graphics performance would be upset, because you don't get instantaneous screen redraws all the time, and after a heavy graphics-laden screen redraw the cursor may be slow to move for a second. This could definitely make things like game-play and Photoshop problematic.But for most programs, and if you're only running 1 or 2 at a time, the VPC responsiveness is pretty impressive - especially considering it's an emulator. It is definitely very usable - typing has no delay - and it never really feels sluggish that I've been able to tell. On average, VPC seems to take about 25%-30% of CPU resources when I'm doing something in it, but if it is sent to the background, it only takes about 1-3%. That's nice.If your goal is to use VPC to run Windows on a Mac, you may well be disappointed. If your goal is to use VPC simply as a way to run a needed PC program on the Mac, then I think you'll be impressed.One note. Once you've got your VPC up and running, copy your VM document somewhere as a backup. That way if you ever need to ""reinstall"" your Windows OS in VPC, you can simply drag this copy in for a clean ""install"" without having to go through the real 1 hour + OS install."
94552,1,"Quick and easy installation, no problems activating or registering and it didn't slow up my computer. It has a very user friendly interfase, I highly recommend this antivirus over others."
11243,1,"Adobe FrameMaker 6.0 is a high-end utility, which combines the functions of an advanced word processor, layout program, mathematical editor and pre-processing software for commercial printing.___________________________DOCUMENT-WIDE EDITINGThe document structure construction tools are the most powerful feature of FrameMaker. Instead of simple overlay of text formatting, Frame also allows you to work with character and paragraph designs which, once set, can be applied to any paragraph at any time. Moreover, once you change your mind, it's sufficient to change the definition in an easy-to-use and extremely powerful and comprehensive ""paragraph designer"". Then, changes are applied to every paragraph of this type across the document, and to the user's joy - in all files that use this paragraph. FrameMaker makes extensive use of an additional document structure tool - the famous *.book file, which virtually binds your chapters into a book, a single, operational structural file. Apply a paragraph change to a book, and every single chapter, kept in a separate file - will reflect the change. You don't have to do it by hand, and worry that you will omit one instance or another. Automation and book-wide commands are the ultimate strength of this program. A special Character Designer allows you to apply an additional layer for a selected set of words or text objects in your document. This is handy for casual editing. The Paragraph Designer and Character Designer, which appear in Adobe-unique floating boxes, are your everyday working tools._________________________DOCUMENT STRUCTUREIn addition to powerful editing tools, FrameMaker makes extensive use of document-layers, much in the vein of Photoshop. Except the document body, you keep separate files, called the Master Pages, which are the utilizable templates affecting all body pages. A master page defines document-uniform layout properties like page size, position, header, footer, page numbering, text frames, graphic layout elements like dim background, border art, footer symbols, etc. Widely available on the web, and also from Adobe, are the document templates, with pre-defined styles and useful text-formatting definitions. All of those work like macros. Once specified, they can be applied instantaneously to any selection or all documents at once via the book window. Importing select definitions is a snap, so that you have infinite possibilities of formatting, while preserving the benefits of automation.____________________________________________________ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOYYes, but not in Frame. Whatever you needed to do by hand in popular programs, you can automate in FrameMaker - an enormous advantage of this program. Whether you need to apply specific changes like text layout, text-flow, sidebars, or various paragraph formats, it's a matter of a single click, IRRESPECTIVE of the length of the document, its degree of complexity, and the number of chapters in a book. Popular programs give you only some control over the text and are helpless with layout or complex documents of substantial length. If you need to work on a textbook or a highly technical scientific document of any length, Frame applies all changes in a split-second - a real eye-opener for those who thus far lived in the World of Word._________OBJECTSFrame places all objects in frames, and allows a full customization of frames, their layout, graphic resolution, etc. This is handy for all graphics, including bullets in numbered lists, and any anchored objects that appear in sidebars. From experience I can vouch for the easiness with which FrameMaker handles these usually cumbersome tasks. In other applications, equations are treated as objects, and should you need to change a setting, you need to do changes by hand for every object. Imagine the degree of workload for a 1000-page document full of math! Frame applies changes in a second, since it treats equations as text. This feature is the sole reason why technical writers should stop using other popular programs and switch to Frame immediately.___________________________________________________CROSS-REFERENCES, INDEX, TABLES OF CONTENTSFrameMaker handles cross-references like a dream. So often we need to use footnotes, endnotes, references, definitions, not to mention a good index or table of contents. There is nothing wimpy in Frame in this respect. Updating cross-references, working with them - is very easy, once you learn how to use context-specific menu. Then, all changes are updated automatically, and your index shall be admirable, and will not take days of erroneous manual wading through a document. That is the sole reason for Frame to be the primary choice for textbooks and technical documents. The capabilities and scope of configuration options might give you a headache of bliss.____________EXPORTINGThe package contains also built-in utilities for exporting the mother format into portable web documents, and a separate utility, Webworks Publisher Standard that allows you to transform the Frame documents into web-wide languages of HTML, DHTML and XML. Obviously, Frame supports PDF - you can export your complicated book into PDF with all structure preserved. Adobe Distiller is on the program CD, so that you can ""print"" your document, or set of documents - into this virtual printer and generate an Adobe PDF. In consequence, you do not really need a full version Adobe Acrobat. Many dynamic user-active web documents were created in Frame, and converted by Webworks utility with XML specification.__________________________PRICE AND COMPETITIONYes, it does cost two or three times the competitive products. Once you overcome the learning curve, not only you will have easy time with all documents you will need to work with in your life, irrespective of their length or complexity, but you will also create documents of excellent quality, which are cross-platform-compatible, and which are more than acceptable for commercial printing. In fact, if you work closely with your publisher, they will either demand a Frame-generated postscript, or a Tex file. They are very similar products, but Frame is much more user friendly, since the latter is essentially a programming language. Frame has its mouse-clicker advantages, and thanks Adobe for that. The world of high-end publishing is finally available for everyone."
65402,1,I have been very pleased with this purchase. It is well tailored to teach spoken German. The software starts with basic words and fairly quickly introduces conversation sequences from relevant situations. Voice recording allows the user to hear is own voice and compare it with that of a native speaker a feature which helps learning the correct pronunciation. Grammar is reviewed thoroughly but is not very well exercised.

76145,1,"I've been using Retrospect Express for a couple of years now, both on my Mac and PC. It works great. I had some trouble with the new PC version (5.6) working under Windows XP, but a couple of calls to tech support straightened everything out. Dantz support is pretty good -- much better than I'm used to these days!"
33050,1,"In this game Putt-Putt has to reunite the baby animals with their parents in the new Car Town zoo. It helps develop problem solving skills. It is also entertaining. I enjoyed playing it with my daughter. If fact, she had played alot of it on her own so she showed me how to play it. A children's game is well written when a 5 year old can start it, play it and then expain it to an adult without a problem. Hats off to Humongous Entertainment."
50146,1,"As far as updates to OS X go, leopard is sub par to Tiger. The functionality is good but you are sacrificing a little speed as leopard feels more bulky, less streamlined. I am a power user and a former employee of the fruit stand and think that Leopard lost a little of what made Apple the niche that it was. Some of the features work quite well but I think this dark, spacey feel pulls towards ""the dark side"" or a microsoftian feel. Whatever it takes to get more customers I guess. My suggestion to make this all ok is to include a simple mode that reduces options for users that would almost never be necessary. Cheers"
57148,1,"I sent a Terrain Navigator California Set to my father earlier this year as a gift. He just can't stop saying good things about it. So I got the New England region for myself. I use it for hiking, canoeing and sea kayaking. The GPS wizard makes connecting to my Garmin a snap. The map prints are clear and provide a UTM grid and lots of reference points. Looking at the maps in 3-D provides a real good sense of the terrain. I use this feature with the 3-D glasses which are provided. I would recommend Terrain Navoigator to anyone who works or plays off-road."
36287,1,"I bought PCC a week ago and had some problems installing it. However, the customer support at Trend Micro was very prompt and provided an accurate solution to my problem. I was successfully able to install it and it works great now!"

1940,0,"I tried to use Windows 98 SE on my old laptop, But all I got 16 color display with no sound, PLUS, My flash drive wouldn't install with the drivers in it. When I decided to give Windows ME, The so called Mistake Edition [It's Millennium Edition, But I still find it a mistake on a other machines.] another chance. I got it done with no problems. Display is correct, Sound is working, And my flash drive is fully installed. Sometimes I find this bad Operating System on some machines, But for the Latitude CPT S, This was no Mistake Edition. I would only recommend this if it was worth a penny or free. But if you like Windows ME, Make sure your careful with the money. Make sure your PC or Laptop is perfect for this Version. And don't forget the power saving changes. Make sure you get many updates that you need."
20078,2,"I went through Tax Cut and answered every question honestly and truthfully, but if I had actually sent in the return it prepared for me, I would be on my way to jail!Just a sampling of the problems:-- Even though I entered that I had contributed to a ROTH (non-deductable) IRA, Tax Cut still deducted my contribution from my income. I had to fix the problem manually. If this gross error had slipped by, I would have certainly been audited and penalized.-- Tax Cut did not ask me if any of my work-related education expenses were reimbursed by my employer (some of them were). Again, this required a manual fix, and could have resulted in more trouble from the IRS had I actually sent the erroneous return in.-- Tax Cut totally hosed up importing my capital gains info from Quicken. This took me HOURS to recalculate and enter manually.-- Even though I told Tax Cut during the interview section that I had no deductible medical expenses, it took my imported Quicken medical expenses and tried to deduct them anyway. If you still (foolishly) decide to use Tax Cut, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT TRY TO IMPORT DATA FROM QUICKEN!!!On top of everything else, this product is loaded with advertising tie-ins to try to get you into an H&R; Block for more business. I cannot say enough bad things about this program. It is awful. It is more than a waste of money -- it may cost you thousands in penalties."
15283,1,"If we must pay taxes, and we must, this program makes it less harrowing. The instrucctions are simple and the program does all the figuring for you. My only complaint is that it keeps advertising other H&R Block services. Not a big deal, but somewhat annoying."
62570,1,"I have had this set for over four years now. I am well studied in the use of tarot cards and currently own 5 different decks. Although I am happy with all my tarot cards I prefer to use the Tarot Magic disc. It is very insightful and suprisingly accurate everytime. The Palmistry disc is very detailed, but not as fun because you have to read everything. The astrology disc is also OK I prefer Kepler 7.0 (That is GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!), and I have never got the Oracle of Change disc to work. Altogether I think the set is well put together, but I would have only given it 2.5 stars if it was not for the Tarot Magic."
40930,1,"InFocus will tell you that this is not the projector for movies or TV. It's for presentations. It has another projector similar to the X2 that IS made for movies and TV, and because of this it does cost more.I chose this as my full time TV, and I've had it for 2 years. I purchased an extra bulb just to have with me, but at 2150 hours, I have not needed to. I run it in low power mode (1100 lumens), and I don't expect HD quality video. The video is BETTER than a rear projection TV, but can't touch a plasma or even an LCD tv. It wasn't even meant for this purpose. Given it's price however, It is certainly well deserving of better reviews than people give it. If you have the money, and your a quality buff, step up to a projector made for movies and TV. If your doing powerpoint presentations all the time or just want a big screen, higher quality picture than your old TV, then this is an excellent option."
47797,1,It is a great product for someone who has limited typing abilities or for those who just hate the keyboard. You have to speak one word at a time. It takes about 15 min to finish the voice setup. This Product is easy to setup. Overall it's the bomb!
36322,1,"If you are looking to possess nothing but recipes this is the program for you. However, if nutritional information is a must for you, you should know that this has only a table which lists nutritional information for individual ingredients; not for entire recipes.

89131,1,"In my business, I'm forced to use two Windows-only products: Visio and Project. Rather than buy another PC, I tried Parallels. So far, the product has exceeded my expectations.The only issue I've had is in using an external USB disk drive. But the solution to the problem of Parallels not recognizing it is simple. It's just a matter of first ""ejecting"" the disk from Finder, unplugging the disk's USB cable from the Mac, then launching Parallels. Once Windows loads, plug the disk drive back in and all is cool."

92371,0,"It had been fifteen years since Jane Fonda made ""Stanley & Iris"" with Robert De Niro. Then she sort of retired to be Ted Turner's wife, which actually ended up being a longer gig than most people thought. Then at some point in the last couple of years she must have decided she wanted to make movies again, or at least one more movie, and apparently she has fallen so far from being a two-time Academy Award winner, daughter of Henry Fonda, and the space babe ""Barbarella,"" that all she could get was ""Monster-in-Law."" This is certainly a sorry state of affairs, but then De Niro made ""Meet the Fockers"" last year, so maybe this really was the best script Fonda could get.The idea of Jane Fonda as the (future) mother-in-law from Hell for Jennifer Lopez sounds good at face value. Why not? The idea of the mother-in-law from Hell is old as the hills. The problem is that screenwriter Anya Kochoff is not and this script, her first screenwriting credit, is basically a decent first draft. There are a few big laughs in the movie, but if you are going to bring Jane Fonda back from the dead to make a film with J Lo you want something worth watching a second time, and that ""Monster-in-Law"" is not.This one goes off the tracks when we meet the two characters. Lopez is Charlotte call me ""Charlie"" Cantilini, who does temp jobs and walks dogs to get by. Her horoscope tells her that love is right in front of her and when she looks up there is Kevin Fields (Michael Vartan). That would be too easy, so they have to keep on meeting until they finally exchange names and move in together. Meanwhile, we learn that Viola Field (Jane Fonda) was a Barbara Walters type television personality who was summarily fired for being too old and allowed to broadcast one more show so that she could become unhinged on national TV and have to be institutionalized.Okay, so we know that Charlie is nice and that Viola can go off the deep end. The question is why, when Kevin brings Charlie home to meet Viola and both his girl friend and his mother by proposing marriage, does Viola decide to try and destroy Charlie? Apparently it is not because she is overly protective of the son she has been ignoring during her busy career, but rather because she violently throttled one young woman so why not do it again? Because otherwise Viola would have to be racist or elitist or a combination thereof. Still, the simplest explanation for why Viola does what she does is that the script was written that way. You want character motivation, go back to doing movies that will get you nominated for an Oscar.I agree with the idea that Charlie should fight back, but almost as soon as the movie starts down that path it abandons it. Charlie overplays her hand and then Fate makes things take an ugly turn, and then the last act of the movie plays it straight by the numbers without trying to connect the dots so that the obligatory moment of reconciliation actually makes sense. Yeah, it is a nice little speech, as Ruby (Wanda Sykes), Viola's assistant, notes, but it would be more effective if it was a culmination of what comes previously and not just a two-minute warning that the film is almost over.Vartan is given nothing to do besides look good and stay out of the way of the ladies who have their names over the title. But Sykes is really wasted in this one. Almost all of her dialogue consists of muttered comic asides, because since she is speaking the truth she cannot really be heard by Viola until the end of the film, otherwise the movie avoids a lot of nonsense and it needs a new title. Credits to J Lo for doing the bit with the lips, but somebody should have asked for at least a rewrite if not some major script doctoring on this forgettable 2005 comedy. At least Fonda has to make another movie after this one, because otherwise film historians will be saying, yes, Bela Lugosi's last film was Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" but Jane Fonda finished her career by making ""Monster-in-Law."""

36226,1,"I've never been a great fan of Adobe software so it was with some reluctance that I tested GoLIve CS2. My need was for a WYSIWYG package that supported CSS properly. Normally, I develop sites using NetObjects Fusion, but support for CSS has been slow coming. I'm afraid I have had none of the problems other reviewers report for GoLive. It has never crashed, appears no more buggy than any other software, has allowed me to develop a complete site formatted entirely with CSS that displays well in all browsers, and, even though the interface is completely novel, I found it easy to learn and anjoyable to use. My only caveat is that, with the acquisition of Macromedia, it is likely that Adobe will eventually drop GoLive in favour of the much inferior but more popular DreamWeaver. Until that happens, I will stick with GoLive."

19119,1,"Brought my Garmin Nuvi to Austria with a Europe card in it. Honestly, it made my trip so much better. First, I didn't have to keep referring to maps or stopping for directions. And...I never got lost! Well, once, but for a 2 week trip...that's pretty good.Also, because the Nuvi goes into pedestrian mode, when I parked our car, I was able to save it in Favorites and easily find my way back when the time came. But as for having the Europe card, it was so much more productive to know exactly where to walk to see different sites.Also, the sights and restaurant suggestions were pretty good and up to date.One criticism is that sometimes when I put in a smaller town to drive to, there were several towns with the same name and while I could logically figure out which one I wanted by the distance, some of the regions and countries were mentioned in foreign languages which made it confusing. In other words, all of a sudden, when they would name the country the town was in, they would use the Austrian word for ""Austria"" for no apparent reason at all. A minor disturbance forA product that really helped me travel.Myles"
88847,0,"As a fan of the ""Original Miniseries"" & the sub-par ""Final Battle"", I decided to get ""The Series"" after a long hesitation, like many I had grew up with this show in the 80's, & had a hard time remembering the ""Series"", so I got it recently & I don't feel like I wasted my money on it, but I was a bit disappointed at the direction it took, the 1st episode ""Liberation Day"" picks up where the ""Final Battle"" left off, where Donovan manages to capture Diana who had escaped at the end of the ""Final Battle"" & we see the survivors of the ""Final Battle"", Donovan, Julie, Elias, Ham Tyler, Robin & Robert Maxwell, & friendly visitors Martin & Willie trying to live a normal life again a year later, Donovan & Martin covering news stories, Julie resuming her science education, Ham once again a mercenary for hire, & Elias & Willie owning a resturant, but it is short lived once Diana escapes custody & makes her way to a satellite station & signals more visitors, it is here that Diana discovers the rest dust is only active for so long & once again the visitors try to regain control of Earth, this show had promise at first, & the first few episodes are on par with the two miniseries, Nathan & Kyle Bates are two new interesting characters & Nathan is a believable character as a Donald Trump clone who owns ""Science Frontiers"" a corporate company, who keeps Diana at bay,(imagine that), & Kyle, his rebellious son who joins the resistance, we are also introduced to visitor Lydia, who replaces the doomed Pamela from the ""Final Battle"" as Diana's catfighting rival & Charles who is by far one of the more charismatic characters ever to appear on ""V"", but by the 12th episode the magic is gone & I mean gone!!, to start with, they kill off Martin & Robert Maxwell in the beginning, which didn't bother me, what bothered me was how the production value diminished with each episode, by the 12th one, Elias, Nathan Bates, his japanese henchman, & Charles are killed off, Ham Tyler & Robin are written out, & the Science Frontiers subplot is gone, & L.A. seems to shrink suddnely, & by episode 13, we are left with Donovan, Julie, Willie, Kyle, & Starchild Elizabeth who has morphed into a hot woman for some time, who now rides around like the ""A Team"" fighting visitors in what looks like Hazzard county from ""Dukes of Hazzard"" which also was a Warner Bros. production the same as ""V"" & had ended its run about this same time, it is as if Warner Bros. decided to use the ""Dukes"" sets to SAVE MONEY!!! & it really cheapens the ""V"" story arc as a whole, Donovan & Julie become a joke & Diana & Lydia act as if they were on ""Dynasty"" & Frank Ashmore who played Martin returns as his twin brother in I guess Warner's last ditch attempt to boost the ratings, so much potential lost due to Warner Bros. & NBC's ignorance & greed, not to mention the reuse of scenes which didn't bother me as long as the story was solid, this is my take, & if your a hardcore ""V"" fan, then it is worth it for the first 12 episodes anyway, the last 6 you might be able to get through if you don't die laughing, but it is worth it for the first 12 at least"

90639,2,"Microsoft essentially took all the useful functions of Word and shuffled them around, while adding some useless functions to distract you (do I really need a blog template?) The new ribbon (it's not even visually attractive) takes all intuition out of navigating through the app. Each command is now a small icon (for all those illiterate Word users) and is variably sized (meaning your eye jerks over each section, instead of down aligned lists). Customization is almost totally left out. Old versions let you customize the toolbars with commands you use most so they're what you need, grouped together to easily find. Now you're limited to one pathetic Quick Access bar. The abbreviated icons / heiroglyphics means it no longer reminds you of shortcut keys (and you have to wade back into that infernal ribbon to find them, meaning they're no longer a shortcut.) I'm all for learning if new & improved, but this yellow-boxed garbage is just counterintuitive."
87205,0,"Perhaps it's because I'm used to using professional programs like Photoshop and Final Cut Pro, but each of the components in the iLife '04 package leaves something to be desired. The integration of so many formats of media into one network of interrelated programs is a good idea, but each program still has nagging issues that prevent it from being all that it can be.Let's start with the new flagship, GarageBand, the reason I bought this package. I loved the concept and jumped at the chance to get a low-priced music-recording program, but using it is just not an inviting experience. The ordinary computer user with no music-recording experience would be thrilled simply at being offered the opportunity to try out music composition and arrangement, but I've been recording for years and this program doesn't offer enough. The first piece I tried to record was a short, arhythmic orchestral string piece intended for a short film, and the program gave me problems left and right. The frame sizes are too large, preventing you from doing detailed editing (for example, my soundwaves tend to cross from one frame to another and I can't put the cursor to after the wave so as to be able to cut it off where it ends). Playback is extremely poor, even though I have a top-of-the-line G5 with dual 2.0 GHz processors; every time you click on the timeline and play, the track takes one to two seconds to kick in, an eternity in music recording. And even after buying the JamPack, which costs close to $100, the number of instruments available is small. Why would you offer &quot;Chain Saw Bass&quot; and &quot;Telephone Lines&quot; as available instruments but not something as basic as harp? Clarinet? Harmonica? Mandolin? Banjo? Playing guitar parts on a MIDI keyboard is admittedly questionable, but having only one distorted electric-guitar sound is also deficient. And no ability to rename tracks? Definitely a bad thing. Tracks have to be named after the instrument you're using! If you layer five parts with one instrument but different effects applied, you won't be able to rename the tracks the way you want. You can't even suffix the track name with a number just to distinguish one part from another.So GarageBand was a letdown. Perhaps not surprising given that it's part of a $50 package, but the things I'm talking about sound like design issues, not a limitation based on cost. I&quot;m not talking about the ability to redraw waveforms or even to quantize here.The rest of the package: iTunes is the standard for &quot;computer jukeboxes&quot; and I've been using it for years. The layout is user-friendly and I like the ability of later versions to match name changes in libraries as well as playlists, but there remain several problems. Why no ability to determine what your destination disks are called? Instead, each import you do creates two, sometimes three subfolders, which makes for messy file management. And iTunes' interaction with GarageBand is horrible -- when exporting a GarageBand mix, the computer renames your files with impudence and sticks them into subfolders without telling you where. I've checked the options under GarageBand and it doesn't look like something you can configure to your liking.iDVD is a good resource for people to have, provided you can generate file formats compatible with this program. Inexplicably, though, iDVD doesn't recognize the MPEG-4 format -- the standard for DVD encoding! I had a long project on Final Cut that I wanted to compress into MPEG-4 before burning to DVD, and iDVD refused to recognize it. iDVD project files can also become bloated -- seems like it includes the encodings as part of the project file, rather than using the project-media separation so common among non-linear editing programs. Worst yet, iDVD can't be launched without trying to open the last project saved, which can result in a lot of wasted time if your last project is large. While I do use it, iDVD is far from being a good DVD program.iPhoto -- I access and edit my visuals with Photoshop, so almost all of iPhoto's features are useless to me. I use it to import digital photos and it works fine for the purpose, but it's probably more useful for other consumers.iMovie -- Since I own Final Cut Pro, I have no reason to use this program. The interface looks clumsy, though, so I was never even tempted to try it out.Overall, I think that Apple's designs in these programs underestimate the computer ability of their users. Most of these programs don't allow you ultimate freedom in file management, and I think most users are savvy enough to know how to organize their files in the computer to a certain degree. It seems to me iTunes is the most &quot;mature&quot; program of the bunch, with the fewest problems. GarageBand was a good concept but will require massive rethinking, and more input from musicians. I can't think of any recording musician I know who would be satisfied with the options on this program. For a package like this, I wouldn't have minded paying more money to get more options and for improved design."

I tried using manual color calibration tools which did make a big difference, but my color was still not quite right. This was so easy and accurate I regret not doing it sooner. All you have to do is install the software, disable any color altering settings you currently have in use, plug it in and let it go. It takes a few minutes going through various colors and then it is done, just like that. I have done this on both my desktop LCD and notebook LCD and they both look great. The colors just seem to have more contrast and detail. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get accurate color representation out of their monitors but don't want to spend a lot of time doing it."

53598,0,"Much has been written in these Amazon.com reviews about the problems with this product. And, I find it hard to disagree with much of what has been said. However, when I load it into my GPS Map 76S it is a beautiful thing. It looks better on the GPS than on the computer. I also like the ability to build, and save, routes on my computer and then load them in the GPS as needed. It is much easier to use a full computer screen and a mouse to click the waypoints, rather than using the much smaller GPS screen and controls. Probably my biggest gripe is the pre-defined areas that can be loaded to the GPS. One corner of New York City is on the New Jersey map. So to get the as small part of the western side of the Island of Matthatten, you have to use valuable memory loading the top half of New Jersey. MapSource is not as nice a map as my DeLorme, which I use all the time on my computer. However, this is the only game in town for use with the Garmin GPS. If you want a map to use on your computer get DeLorme or the Microsoft product, both of which are cheaper that MapSource. If you have a Garmin GPS this is a product, despite some flaws, does work very well."
87728,1,"I got Atari Anniversary Edition as one of my wife's Valentine's Day gifts and it was definitely one of the best gifts she's gotten in recent years, based on her reaction when she got it and how often she's been playing it since. The fact that it only cost a few bucks and included ten great games made it nothing short of an outstanding purchase! We played direct from the disc so there was no installation or set-up time, just instant gratification. Playing the games is a highly entertaining step back in time. The look and sounds of each game is dead on. At this point, we've tried three grames so far: Asteroids, Centipede and Millipede. Playing Asteroids on a laptop is similar to, but not the same as playing on the arcade machine. Using the laptop cursor keys and space bar in lieu of the arcade controls requires some getting used to. However, Centipede and Millipede played almost exactly like playing on the arcade machine. We use the laptop's built-in mousepad like the roller ball and the space bar to fire. Bottom line, these games are the real deal and represent endless hours of fun for us and our two young kids. For the price, Atari Anniversary Edition is almost impossible to beat!"

728,1,"I've recently been reading a ton of complaints around the web about the Symantec Norton Antivirus and Internet Security Suite of software. The following little review has been written in response to those complaints:One of the biggest complaints that I read about Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security is the cost. For me, however, the annual upgrade on Norton Products always ends up free--at least it has since the turn of the millenium. Inevitably if you wait long enough their rebates come out that make the upgrade to the new product absolutely cost free. This holds true even with their full suite which may retail at $70, but I've managed to get 5 copies for various computers I manage at a final cost to me of $0. Actually, with Amazon.com because I get a discount because of the A9 search engine, I think I've managed to earn a couple of bucks by installing Norton Internet Security. Next year, I'll use the rebates to do the same.With Internet Security, the concerns of many people who are against Norton and Symantec (especially firewall) with the exception of the resource hog issue (Symantec really needs to address this issue) are handled.Symantec needs to fix their technical service side of things by offering free help of at least some sort. They need to tone down the issues of resource hogging. But as long as they offer me free upgrades every year and consistently maintain virus-free computers (6 years virus free on all on the computers I've managed: usually 5-7 at one time) I'll stick with Symantec. Nevertheless, despite these pitfalls, as long as I can keep upgrading for free and my systems remain virus-free, Norton is my source for internet security.http://www.hantla.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=10"

That next day, I called back and was on the phone w/ support for over 1 hour, just having conversation about the features and functions of this product. I was expecting the 5 minute rush drill before I was rushed off the phone. Not w/ these guys. GREAT SUPPORT. Now, for the product ... here is the deal. I used to use Ghost. Ghost was great, as it created an image that can be used for disaster recovery scenarios. Acronis is BETTER, because you can append to the image. This is stellar. If my hard drive fails, I can throw in a new hardrive, and rebuild. It doesn't get any easier than this. If you aren't using this product, and anything like this ... then don't complain when your hard drive crashes, and you loose everything. There is too much technology today that will help you prepare for anything (much like an insurance policy). Oh ...

32036,2,"This is the first Barbie computer game we purchased. I was very disappointed in the quality of graphics and sound. It really reminds me of computer games from 15 years ago. I played the original King's Quest games and THEY were better than this.There is little or no explanation of what or how to do anything and it is NOT intuitive. Yesterday, my daughter (5 1/2) was playing it and was told to stand on the circle matching the one Shiver is on. She did, and nothing happened. My husband tried, and nothing happened. I tried, and nothing happened. DD finally figured out (after MUCH time) that after standing on the circle, you had to press the space bar. There was no indication that was needed and no where else in the game (that I could see) was that a requirement for any other activity.On top of the poor graphics, sound, and ease of use ~ the game is completely pointless. You just walk around and around and you keep looking for that (!!) Shiver! FINALLY after hours of play, my DD told me she found an area that you can play games. But, even to her, they seemed pretty lame. Of course, she keeps playing the blasted game because it is Barbie and she loves it.Save your money! I got this 1/2 off at a Scholastic Warehouse sale and even THAT was too much. This is definitely not worth the aggravation."
92743,1,"Like it or not, Office is THE standard and this is the last version before the radically new user interface in Office 2007.By the way, Outlook is not really a ""virus magnet"" - any email client can bring in something you don't want.Also, watch out for ""used"" copies because this product requires activation. If you get one that was already activated it might not activate for you."
64691,1,"My four year old loves this game! He's still a little young to figure it all out by himself, but with aome help from mom or dad he does just fine. The very best thing about this game is the way it changes from one playing to the next. You should have seen the look on my son's face the first time he saw a tunnel in the mine that wasn't there the first time he played it.I'm giving this five stars because it deserves it, but also to help balance out the one star review..."
1747,1,"I find that Microsoft's streets and trips very easy to use . Setup is a snap configuring the GPS is a no brainer . I particularly like the voice commands , it keeps you apprised of upcoming turns. Being able to display your map on a large screen is a lot better than a small two to four inch display . I do suggest a DC converter for your power supply ,you really become dependent on the mapping system . I have the 2006 version,and purchased 2007 DVD for my son and also suggested to a friend of mine buy one for her husband , everyone is happy ."
74147,1,this is a versatile set. with enough goodies to give a beginner a working knowledge of the POSER application. it doesn't include POSER 4 but it works as a nice intro for it.
22037,0,"I bought this program for my 6-year-old to play by herself while I finished out my workday at home after she returns from school. I suppose I can't complain because the program states it uses the immersion method, but I thought it would give more cues (like a picture of a butterfly, and someone saying in French ""A butterfly. There is a butterfly."") Instead, it just launches into full French with very little context or vocabulary practice to help understand what is being said. My daughter knows some French, but she was quickly annoyed because she had no idea what was being said or how to play other than randomly clicking icons. The only way the program is useful is if I sit with her and explain everything, which was not I had hoped for. Graphics and games are also very basic."
53255,0,"Pros :1. A mapping software that I have used for 5 years... same Streets and Trips. No learning curve there2. Nice auto pan and zoomCons:1. The audio directions occur only just before the turn I need to make, does not give me enough time to change lanes etc (this could be big issue in NY and NY area :). In other s/ws Delrome, Tom Tom etc you get more than one prompts. But Streets & Trips gives only one announcement and that too only about .1 - .2 miles before you gotta make the turn or take an exit.2. Voice prompts are text-to-speech, and not the pre-recorded voice, which I think is better to understand3. Voice volume is very low, even though I have changed and played with all my Windows XP as well as laptop volume settings.4. No indication of 'miles to destination' - it shoul be in bif bolds."
48684,1,"I've tried many-many internet security products--have been using a PC since 1983 and am on my fifth one in the home office where I earn my living--and for years I was sure there was nothing as good as Norton/Symantec. Until I tried this. This company is so on top of threats that they often download updates for new threats twice in a single day. There are all kinds of different ways you can set it for just the things you personally need it for, from spam to viruses to whatever; block certain sites with ease, always allow other sites--whatever. Great support too!--which Norton has almost none of at all. And talk about blazing fast scans, wow! Comes up in the blink of an eye, does it stuff, and it's done--that's what I needed for my job. Then just think: without buying a package for each of your other computers, this is legal to use on three at one time--without paying any more. So it's up-to-the-minute protection, it's super-fast, and it's thorough. Can't get any better than that. I don't see how they can sell such a great product, with such support and ongoing expertise, for such a low price. After using it for a couple of months, I find it gives me such peace of mind about internet threats. Whew."

38609,1,"I have worked with various photo/movie editors. This is a simple solution for editing, if you don't wan't to waste time in complicted editing. If I want to edit something simple, cute and easy I use this one. The price isn't bad either. It is excellent for tivo because you can remove the comercials and parts you don't want on your dvd very easilly. Compared to it's competition in the SAME price range this one is the best.Can't coompare a product with software that cost a lot more.Compare to going to Macdonald's and being fed in 5 minutes, or preparing a gourmet food. Some people hate Macdonald's, others love the convinience of having food prepared fast with litlle work.I gave it a five stars because for what the product is out to do it does an excellent job."

92792,2,"This program is awful! Not only is it incredibly difficult to figure out but it is severely limited. I was suckered by the box comparisons and swayed by the price, but now I'm stuck with a 20$ piece of garbage and I have to buy a new program to do what this one claimed it would. Don't waste your time or money!!"

2394,1,"Long awaited (altogether too long), but worth it. This is a major improvement over version 2.5, and, quite frankly, is in my opinion the only real option for large scale (ie. symphonic) sampling work. By my estimation, its improved ram handling allows you to load about 33% more samples on your system - and it load thems very quickly! What before might have taken ten minutes, now takes less than one.The inclusion of Gigapulse cannot be overemphasized - it is astonishing, the best convolution reverb I have heard. No need for anything else once you have this.The new piano included is also a nice piece of work - in fact, it is better than most piano libraries available commercially. A shame they didn't decide to sample a concert grand (of the Steinway, Bosendorfer, or Fazioli variety), but it can be applied to many different uses.A must have for the serious composer.P.S.There can be some problems when first installing, but these can be overcome in virtually all cases. Frustrating yes, but the rewards are too great to ignore."
2278,1,"Photoshop is a little tough to use, but extremely powerful for photo manipulation.The browser combined with the RAW editor is a great combination to process the quantities of RAW pictures I take with my trusty EOS 20D.In the rare cases I do red eyes (that unfortunately still, though rarely) happens, I would like an easy tool to get rid of that, like Paint Shop Pro provides.Photoshop works extremely fast on dual-core CPUs like my AMD64 X2."
39304,0,"This is an EXCELLENT product if you're tourist-travelling, or if you plan to use it as I do: a resource for students who are studying geography of the world. The students will be researching the spoken language(s) of their selected/assigned countries and will incorporate as many native languages as possible into the various products they produce to demonstrate learning. The phrases/words that are utilized in 101 Languages isn't enough to actually LEARN a language, but may be of help if you're tourist-travelling or if you're begining to dabble in the feel of a particular language. It is certainly NO Rosetta Stone, which is where a person should go if needing to actually LEARN a language with software. EASY to use and install."
87943,1,"My kids owned this game since they were very small. Every one of their friends played it. Someone liked it so much that they stole it from us. Even though my kids are teenagers now, they still love this game, so when I bought the game again for them, they all wanted to play it! It's original, fun and you can make all sorts of foods with it. I rate this game ""E"" for Everyone!!"
47422,1,"I have been using Desktop To Go for the last six months, synchronizing my Palm III (and previously used it with my PalmPilot Professional) with Outlook 97 (at home) and Outlook 2000 (at work). I synchronize from several times a week to several times a day, and I find it an invaluable tool.The latest version (2.505) has added several valuable new functions, including synchronization of only changed items (which speeds up synchronization), and an optional feedback panel that shows what is being synchronized as it happens. There is also an option that let's you quickly and temporarily turn off Outlook synchronization for those times when all you want to do is install some new software.As with any software, I would advise carefully reading the documentation before using Desktop To Go for the first time.I had a difficulty with installing Desktop To Go on a newly installed Windows NT equipped computer (it later turned out that the NT installation was screwed up), giving me the opportunity to find out how good DataViz Tech Support really is. This is how I found out about the very fine debug option that allows the manufacturer to get a detailed report on all synchronization activity and ways to resolve even the most stubborn tech support issues.I recommend that anyone who wants to use Palm with Outlook try this product."
75159,1,"Very impressed with Western Digital hard drive and the software that came with it. I was able to make the new hard drive my new boot drive, with all the data and operating system from my old drive. I am very pleased with the resulting system."
51487,0,"I found this product to be appropriate for the price I paid. The first one that was delivered was faulty and so it pays to check that the installation disk works. I also found that after importing a file from a previous version into this latest version, the format of the calendar had changed drastically and it took a good period of time to go from month to month correcting the format and alignment of the text. Other that I feel the product was ok. I would probably buy a different product next time."
86405,1,"I've went through many softwares for music composition, including but not limited to composer, sibelius, finale, etc. However, I'd like to say that this is the best program that I have seen so far. The visualizations you get with the software (it's like controlling all the different equipments but with your mouse instead of your hand) as well as the awesome sounds (compared to the other programs I've used/standard midi sound - I believe reason uses sample recordings of actual instruments... the keyboard sounds are especially good). I do agree that this software is geared towards more of electronica music than the 'classical' types; nevertheless, this program provides far superior sounds as well as so many 'built-in sound controls' so that you don't have to spend thousands of dollars on those expensive equipments (unless you're a professional studio musician.. who have the financial resources to afford it)I am not sure if reason is planning on fixing this problem, but the only thing that I did not like about Reason was that they did not have the sheet music that I could actually look at (like finale or composer - I don't know if they've fixed the problem or are planning on fixing this). Other than this, I cannot just praise enough about how much I love this program and frankly, 400 is not that expensive considering what you're getting for your bucks. If you're considering buying a music comp software, then this is the one to buy for sure."
47894,1,"I can still remember sitting in front of a giant Windows 95 moniter. I still love this game, although Amazon should offer a download option instead of purchasing the discontinued disc. In this game you raise dogs or cats. You can build play areas for them, or make them have puppies by spraying love potion. You can also make them go to exotic locations like a beach, or the wild west. The possibilities were addicting (one of the reasons my parents threw my Windows 95 out), and the dogs are adorable. They dig holes, they jump on furniture, so cute. It is a shame Ubisoft got ahold of this franchise though, so buy the disc while they last."
27170,1,"good game, but some people are saying in their reviews that they cant pick out the hooves.What do you do in real life,class?YOU GO UP AND DOWN!!SAME IN THE GAME!!!It gets anoyying though,because if you dont take care of a horse,it gets sick.The wheel thing is hard,my friend who i loaned it to cant even get past it!!!Pretty good game,though."
44774,1,I inserted the card in my Garmin and it quickly displayed my location in Brussels. It worked just like the US version. Very accurate between cities but some issues in the extremely tangled and spaghetti like streets in most Euro cities. In any case it saved us much time and confusion. A winner.
81314,1,"I downloaded the full demo and now am going to order this. I've used Rosetta Stone, and will again. But this is an entirely different method; more like a traditional schoolroom approach. It makes all the difference in the world to have a (virtual) live instructor, versus a bunch of pictures like flash cards.Now, once I've gotten this down, then Rosetta Stone will be a wonderful complement. However, this is my starting point, and I think others will benefit. At least try the demo."
3525,1,"I was unsure about purchasing Word Perfect 12 Home Edition as I have always used Microsoft Office at work. I decided to give it a try as a colleague of mine has it and is very happy with it. Boy, am I happy I made the jump to Word Perfect Office. It has all the features of Microsoft Office but with a more affordable price tag. Today I use it a lot for home and business uses. I can even edit documents from work that I created with Microsoft Excel. If you have Excel documents, you can still open, edit and save them using Word Perfect Office. I highly recommend Word Perfect."
1636,1,"This is not that different than Outlook 2003, however it works with Windows 7 and Vista. But, it should have been included in Office 2007 Home Edition, which it is not. Vista had its own mail client (Windows Mail), but Microsoft ""inconveniently"" left it out of Windows 7 - ugh. No email client comes with Windows 7 so I bought this. Make sure you get the Windows updates for this."
37543,1,"I think that Mcafee did a bang up job! They really thought this version through. Over all this is a great product, but it can take awile to start if you have a slower computer, I also found a few bugs in my system befor I got the patch for it, after that it was easy sailing!"
78048,1,"This is an excellent game. My son delights in playing it whenever he is able. We have a long saga about this game,but the general gist of it is: the hardware requirements need to be much more explicit prior to purchase. My husband literally purchased a new computer, just in order to play this game and found that not even a new computer had the required hardware. We bought hardware and had a friend install it, only to find that it didn't work either. That was with the PC version. We were delighted when the Mac version was released and bought it hoping to play it on my relatively new computer, but to no avail! Finally, we found another person's computer that has more RAM and my son is able to play it finally. Needless to say, it has been difficult for our son to remain patient. He has loved Star Wars since he was six. He loves the game. And, it has been a two year saga of failed attempts until recently. Even now, it is not ideal. And, he is grateful that he CAN play his game (now that we own both versions, though neither work at home!!)Please do parents who might be considered ""technically challenged"" a favor---be explicit with the technical requirements in BOLD prior to purchase. Thank you!"
88491,1,This Jam pack is super fun and a lot of fun to play around with. I've made some really cool songs with this program and highly recommend it!!
11830,0,"I tried this game out awhile back, and even though I was impressed with the overall look of the game, and enjoyed the catchy music and crazy sound effects, I have to put down the control-ability. I could not keep all of the controls in line, there was too many of them! Plus, it didn't help that the opponents are VERY hard, even on the easiest setting (I never got past 3rd on any given track), so while you're struggling with the fact that you don't have 7 fingers on each hand, you're getting continuously pummeled by the other drivers. The only mode worth playing is time trial and that gets old really fast!"
83331,1,"For the first time in several versions Microsoft has changed the file format. However, it is for the better. The new files are all compressed using the ZIP compression format so files are MUCH smaller (old files are 3-4 times larger than new files). The new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification (i.e. Linux geeks can open Office documents).The new interface is RADICALLY different. Do not install this if you have a large project to complete. The interface is SO different you will not complete on time. However, after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it."
35512,1,My son liked it! It's was used. But in great condition.I received it with in the time(according to the shipping I payed for).I give them 4 stars! I think that it's best for kids 5-9 and under.
47280,2,It is the worst childrens software I have seen in a long time. It does not engage the child at all. It is also very limited in what it teaches. Don't buy it -- it sucks!

9995,1,"Easy to install...easy to use, and best of all I was able to upgrade my HP printer software (free download) making it much more compatible with my Mac!"
59542,1,"I have been playing for less than a year. This unit is great for a beginner because it does not require an investment in an amp and multiple effects pedals for the beginner to be able to sample some great tones. It sounds really good through the stereo (I alternate between a Gibson SG '61 and an Ibanez AFS75 Archtop). The basic lessons through the online service are good, and access to the service is very convenient over my home wireless network. The unit is extremely portable and extremely easy to set up and just play. I run a VAIO Notebook under Windows XP and had no problem with the initial install or the upgrade. I have kids and don't have a lot of room for gear so this works well for me. I can just tuck it away in a drawer when I'm done playing. I usually play though 'phones while the kids are sleeping. Overall, if I had purchased it (I got it as a gift) I would say it's the best investment I have made in guitar gear (aside, of course, from my beautiful SG)."

42115,1,"I had an unfortunate experience with an under-warranty Gateway running XP. To make a long story short, they eventually fixed it but only after re-installing XP (which they did not have to do). I was left with no software at all (even that which came with the computer since it was destroyed by a moving company). I determined this would not happen again. I purchased Drive Image 7 and it was the easiest program I ever used. Following their step by step instructions I tested to see if it would boot off the CD (it did) and backed up in no time to an external drive. You can even schedule backups and copy the backup to a CD. I wish I had this sooner. Best thing is you don't need to be a computer genius to use it."
36194,1,This product is soooo cool.I am currently using it w/ a hauppauge card and an ati tv wonder card. This one application will support multiple cards (as many as you can fit) and can record shows just like other set top boxes. It also sets up a web server that allows you to access any tv shows and download them from across the network and set recordings. As if thats not enough you can also log into [...] and add shows when your away from your home network. This software IS PERFECT. Do not waste any more time and BUY THIS.
20496,1,"I must say that you have to be really, and I mean really really patient to use this program. I worked with a 30 minute video project that I burned to a DVD and didn't have a bit of problem except off course slowness. I use a Dell 1.6GHz with 640MB Ram and 80GB drive. It never crashed for me although I have read a lot of reviews stating that program is very unstable. This is not the case for me. I finished entire project in one day. I did a lot of editing with over 100 transition effects and background music. Rendering took over 8 hours but I let it run overnight and the dvd was burned in the morning without any flaws. The only bad part about it is that when I was adding tranitions it made me wait a long time to add each transition effect. Over all I am satisfied with the program. It produced excellent results for me."
2331,0,"For all I know, this is a great product. But it is NOT a DVD. I searched in Movies and TV for CHESS and this came up. I do not run Windows, so I cannot use this. Amazon needs to be more careful how titles are categorized. Why this couldn't produced on viewable DVD, for those who don't want to be stuck at the workstation, would be nice to know. What those who choose Mac/Apple are supposed to do, I don't know either."
1583,1,"was shipped really fast. I selected 3 day shipping, and received it on the 2nd day. The software itself is...well..Microsoft; It has its ups and downs."
67562,1,"I got this for my 10-year-old daughter. She installed it. The tools are fairly easy to figure out. As you would expect, the effects are pretty limited, but I think it's perfect for kids, or grown-ups who have no desire to learn more powerful (yet complex) programs like photoshop."
39057,0,I brought this program because I thought that it would give me detailed information concerning chemistry math which is what I was looking for and needed at the time. I did not find it to be very much help to me in the math section but was basically okay for the detailed chemistry section.
7649,1,I have been a QuickBooks user since 2000 and have been a QuickBooks trainer. I used the Beta version of QuickBooks Premier 2006 and found it to be a major upgrade to previous versions. Your opening page can be customized to show all areas of Quickbooks that you use. You can find all the information on all client transactions on one page. QuickBooks finally makes sense to the average business user and the learning curve is within reach. As a trainer of QuickBooks I thank you for making QuickBooks 2006 easier to teach and learn.
63855,1,"Best tax preparation software I've used. Some of the worksheets are a bit tedious, and trying to figure out where some of the numbers come from takes time. But, the calculations are all accurate and the printed forms look just like the originals. It also carries over data from the previous years and can show the trend in taxes paid as well as changes in salary, donations, investments, etc. From my perspective, its an invaluable aide during tax time."
74493,1,"Another customer had a problem with 10% on 10,000 for one year being more than 11,000. Quicken is not doing it wrong, they are compounding the interest, the way it should be done. There is nothing wrong with the financial calculators, you just not doing math the way financial institutions do."
48683,1,I have been using PC-Cillin after dumping McAfee following some lousy customer support with no issues. This new version I was very concerned after reading all of the reviews. It does seem to slow things a little on my AMD PC if I am running all of the options I can run but even with them it is tolerable. I am sure you would not want to run this on anything less but it does work and managing it has been simple.
18756,0,"Being a first time user I found Quicken to be very difficult to understand and assumes everyone will use the complete online features to manage the home and business expenses, retirement and other accounts. I found it very difficult to download files from my financial accounts and import them in to Quicken. Also, when it asks you to set up your account (Online), you must know your service provider DNS, Proxy ID and security stuff. I am still learning it, it is not easy for those of us from the non-account world. Tks, AD"
41321,1,"This software delivers exactly what it promises. Ease of use (there is no &quot;installation&quot; required) and very consistent design among the 10 languages offered makes it easy to navigate. We have a 2YO, and I originally intended to use this myself for now, and introduce it to my child when he is older (the packaging recommends ages 6 and up). But he finds the animations captivating now, and he is already interested in letters, numbers, animals, colors, and using the computer. So while I won't pretend he's a whiz-bang user, I do feel confident that this is software your child can grow with and not become easily bored. The accompanying booklet offers proficiency standards you can use to help direct your child in learning the language, so you could take the approach of getting basic familiarity with letters/pictograms, or numbers, etc. Or you could direct your child through the languages one at a time. And the games are fun to play...they're not mindless and boring, and you can raise the difficulty level on activities (each game has 3 levels). I feel that even if you only ever used one or two of the language modules, you would get your money's worth, especially considering the additional paper exercises that are included (you need Adobe Acrobat to download these, and you can print them up as often as you like). And it's not all just fill-in-the-blank type stuff. You can make flashcards and simple puzzles from some of the sheets. I do wish that maybe Russian or Greek or Arabic was available in the package, but good grief! There are TEN languages in this package! It's a great learning opportunity at a good value."
48422,1,I found this program years back and used it religiously to learn typing. I was beginning to learn how to type.Now I can tell you proudly that i am a fast typer with an excellent speed. Just buy and try it. While clearng my stuff I just found the CD today and can not hold the urge to write this review to show Ho greatfull I am

86068,1,"I have been using this map software for a few weeks now and I keep discovering more things that it will do. The maps are well-detailed. I am using a Garmin eTrex Vista Hcx hand held.After taking a hike into the mountains, I downloaded the track that my GPS recorded and was able to study the detail of my hike with elevation detail and timestamps for all of the trackpoints.The POI's included are good but not complete (not surprising)."
76002,2,"SpamKiller 4 is much better. I promptly reinstalled it after trying 5.0. SpamKiller 5 doesn't run in the system tray and doesn't notify you when your receive new email. The interface looks nicer but is slower and less functional. Recommend getting SpamKiller 4 while it's still available. (Update: One person told me they liked Norton AntiSpam, but all the reviews say it's buggy and slow, so I wouldn't recommend it over SpamKiller 4.)"
70183,2,"Their software came with my Dell computer. I wasn't happy with the service. Now every year at this time they charge my credit card. Their customer support is TERRIBLE, I've had to call in multiple times each year to get them to refund my money (each call was about 20-30mins), and they continue to bill me. I haven't figured out a way to get my credit # out of their system to avoid these charges in the future.VERY FRUSTRATING. I am livid that I have spent so much time on this, and that they contiue to bill me. I think their poor service is by design so that it's more painful to go through the work of a refund than just accepting the charges for a product I haven't used in 3yrs."
38202,0,Still a clunky interface compared to TurboTax. Had to get both this year as TurboTax didn't have one of the forms I needed. In TaxCut Home & Business you actually have to install 2 programs from 2 CDs. They almost seem like they're written by 2 different companies and the Businss one seems to be buggier. All I get is the welcome screen and thne the program disappears. Have had to reinstall several times.

Levels become more difficult as students complete different games. Adults can changes levels of difficulty manually if desired. The second CD includes a printable workbook for extra practice.Graphics are like cartoons and characters do not interact with students in any way, so don't expect a realistic type of game."
50231,1,"1. Leopard is an evolutionary upgrade like every upgrade of OS X since 2001. Feature-wise, it's somewhere in-between modest and major.2. It's a good one. It's got a good deal more hits and misses. Quick Look, Time Machine, Spaces, a better Finder, and a ton of polish everywhere stand out as stars. Even Stacks (which frankly still need a little love from Apple) have their pleasures.3. If you like software, you will want this. Leopard-savvy apps coming out over the next year or two will take advantage of Leopard's very snazzy CoreAnimation toolkit, and they will be very, very cool.4. Bottom line: it's pretty hard to go back to Tiger after using Leopard for a few days."
24777,0,"I learned to build web pages with FrontPage 2000. This is nothing like FrontPage. This is going to take some time to learn and get use to. I am a little discouraged, but will give it more time. Nothing what I expected. I'm seriously thinking I should have upgraded to Frontpage 2003. Maybe I will write a better review once I get to know what in the hell I'm doing."
16374,1,"I tried several webpage packages (notably HotMetal Pro) and I have to say, FrontPage is by far the easiest, most intuitive and powerful software in its class.In no time I had a webpage up and running. Maintaining it is easy, too. Setting up the navigation scheme is simple. There are nice art themes included, and they aren't hard to modify, either. So you can get an attractive webpage published very quickly with FrontPage.It has some quirks. Netscape, forget it. And some of the free webpage hosting sites have trouble with FrontPage's web publishing protocol. This means you have to upload the pages one by one with FTP (file transfer protocol.) And you may not be able to some of the features of the themes like CSS. This doesn't bother me a lot, as it is really more a problem of the hosting site, not FrontPage.The package also allows easy use of ActiveX controls, plug-ins, and Java applets, and normal scripting for fancy stuff on graphics-heavy webpages (careful, as these slow down loading time for many visitors. Know your audience.) If you are going to get heavily into scripts, ActiveX, plug-ins and more, including Flash, better to go into something like Dreamweaver, where you get more control over what goes into the HTML coding.If you want more than a casual homepage as can be designed by such hosting providers as Geocities, this is definitely the package to use. It's fun, too. (When was the last time you could say that about a software package other than a game?)"
2862,0,"Enough Tweaks!!! - Now for REAL some new features!!!!Two year ago I wrote a review on Quicken 2005 begging for some new features in Quicken 2006. Now here we are with Quicken 2007 and the idea bag is just plain empty for Intuit.Let me declare that I am a big fan of Quicken and use it every day. However that just makes me also more demanding of the things that Intuit can really do to improve the product.While the new version looks nicer, there is really nothing new to report. Quicken users need real new features to help in managing our daily affairs. Here are just a few of the ideas still begging for Intuit to get going on.From my Quicken 2005 comments these items are still waiting ....(I should note that since then Quicken has made much easier to send customer feedback on the product.... not that you can every really tell that they do anything with the suggestions but the process is much better.)Savings and Expense Control NOT just Investing.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Lately I have found that while Quicken has done very well on the Investment Tracking features of the program the very critical area of saving and expense planning is sadly under studied.From my list of wanted product features written to Intuit over the years are things that will really help the end user like;1. A Shopping Planner- All of us must shop (groceries, clothes etc) and it is in this area where users can plan to save on some expenses. A good shopping planner would allow for the easy creation of shopping lists, record item prices from different stores so was to prepare estimates of costs for shopping list and track price movements, identify stores that manage their prices better, track real consumer inflation for the good we really buy, etc.2. Utility Accounts (Electricity, Water, Gas, Phone etc)- In paying for our utilities we need to track how much is consumed along with the expense (the KWH, Gallons, Minutes etc). Tracking and graphing utility bill items will help to keep the use mindful of consumption patterns and help identify places to save again. This new class of account should be added.-(Yes, I already use the Quicken Home & Business and it does not have the capacity to capture units of items consumed in a bill. It can do it in an Invoice for items sold however which means that it is possible).3. Budgeting- The only way to say it. The budgeting feature in Quicken is not as easy to use as the one in Money. Period. It needs a re-think!4. Life Planning (Retirement, College etc)- Money just blows quicken away in this area! The differences are dramatic. The feature in Money is just about excellent though it could be improved in a few areas but Quicken's offering here is vastly inferior. Fix the thing!- The Life Planner should be multi-currency also. It does not support this now.- (Hint: you can download the MS Money 90 day trial for free and see what it can do)5. Savings and Investment Accounts- Quicken needs to be able to calculate expected interest income in Accounts based on cash balances, Interest rate, period and balances and to deduct taxes based and other charges on the interest income.- Quicken needs to hand money market investment contracts much better with perhaps and contract input screen that would allow the user to input the details of a money market contract with reminders before the maturity dates.6. Insurance Accounts- Quicken need to allow the users to keep better track of life insurance and home insurance policies with user input for the insurance policy coverage, the monthly premiums, cash value track, alerts for critical renew dates and premium payment dates. A summary report of the total amount of coverage across several polices along with the premium costs would be handy. Policy expirations report would also be useful.Shall we await Quicken 2008 for some real changes?"

56924,1,The most important thing to do when reviewing your digital photos is to make sure the colors on your monitor are correctly calibrated. You don't have to be a graphics maven or computer geek to do this relatively easy color adjustment. Pantone Huey does it for you simply and accurately. The price of this device pays for itself within the time you upload your images and watch with delight the captures of birthday parties to concert photos. What makes it so useful and cost effective is the ease in which to setup this calibration. I have both version of Pantone Huey's for my desk top and laptop.
62483,0,"Streets and Trips is a powerful and fast consumer mapping tool with lots of bells and whistles. I have found it very useful when on business trips where I did not have Internet access. Couple it with a GPS sensor and it is quite a powerful tool for road warriors. One of the more interesting features its ability to find nearby locations (i.e. hotels) - even along a route, which is not entirely apparent to the user. You can actually show every hotel, restaurant, etc x miles in either direction of a route or a single location. It also can calculate trip costs and has construction updates.In terms of performance, it is much, much faster than the Derlorme Street Atlas 2003 or any online map tool. I haven't yet done a head to head comparison with Streets and Trips 2003 because I haven't received it yet.What I don't like...PROBLEMS:1) The locations, especially hotels, are often wildly inaccurate - by 30 miles away. It almost appears if the master data set was compiled by hand in China as I can't imagine how the inaccuracies were created (correct phone, street address, and wrong city). There appears to be no quality control with the locations. Moreover, many are dated by at least three years.2) The exit numbers are often inaccurate, which can cause a huge problem if you are on a business trip3) The GPS update is once every 15 seconds4) There is no data update feature via the web. There is a construction update, but that is it."

Being a Geography major in college, and working in the mapping industry now, I've used all the others, but maptech is by far the best. Detailed topos, great overlays, outstanding GPS hookup, and the 3-D graphics are unbelieveable!!!!! For anyone in a mapping field, or anyone looking to spice up their outdoor adventures, you have got to get this software."
66383,2,"I've been a web professional for over seven years. I loved Dreamweaver 2,3 and 4. I also have the utmost respect for Macromedia. However...Macromedia fell short on Dreamweaver MX. It seems as if the good folks at Macromedia tried to accomodate both front end (html) and back end developers (asp, php, etc).I have yet to see a backend developer use Dreamweaver and why should the front end developers pay extra for features designed for the backend developer. Me, being a front end developer, will hardly use half of the menu items and buttonsDreamweaver is nice in that combined some of the features of Homesite for those of us who know HTML code, the CSS features are also good...but here are other problems1). Properties window changes when working on text. I want to see right align, center, and left align icons, but suddenly, I get none of these! I have to right click on the text and use the menu there.2). The software has bugs! Crashes alot even doing the simplest tasks.3). No longer can we copy and paste from a source code into the Dreamweaver platform...that was a nice feature in previous versions of Dreamweaver.4).The software is a very much of a MEMORY HOG! To develop, I softimes need Photoshop, Flash, and Dreamweaver open at the same time. In addition, I surf the net, get my emails...so I usually have five or six applications running at the same time.When I shut down Dreamweaver, the performance of my other apps improve.So in other words, I will uninstall Dreamweaver MX and go back to Dreamweaver 3.0."

57314,1,"I remember VB 1.0 I was project leader 12 years ago on a job that needed a GUI visualization front-end (the core was a telephony application to be written in C). I could have had the front-end custom written in Motif with Unix workstations, but that would have been prohibitively expensive.VB had been on the market for just one week, and I knew it was ragged and not mature. But it did the job. And it was dirt cheap.And so with Data Analyzer. Sure, it's ragged and immature (no cross-tabs in the grid, for example). But at less than 200 bucks a pop, it's BI for the masses. Will it do the job? Maybe 70% of it. Compared to zero for most business users currently, that's a quantum leap. And all this thin/thick client business? What does a business user care about the techie stuff? Am I going to see about installing en masse into my clent base? Absolutely!Your point about Business Objects etc is well taken. I put BO into my last two clients. It's fabulously powerful. But it's also several thou per seat! The one to worry about is Crystal Analysis. In my view, this is direct competition. Especially when I can put DA onto a hundred desktops for about 6K with volume discounts.I expect to see DA bundled eventually. Probably not into Office, more likely into the SQL Server bundle. This one is a stayer. If I were an ISV Partner, I'd be losing sleep."

51842,1,"My kids (6 and 8) are learning so much from Fritz and Chesster 2!! In fact, my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game (from Fritz and Chesster 1).Today I decided to play with them (since they don't like to play against each other - they're still working on that ""good sportsmanship"" thing), and I let them team up against me. I was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead, predict moves, and protect their pieces.However, I was the one who learned!! They surprised me again and again by reciting strategies (move your bishops and knights out, save your Queen for the real battle, don't move your pawns without a plan, break your oponnent's wall, etc...) they had learned from this game.They also knew the relative value of the pieces, but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes. For example, they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall, which they later exploited to checkmate my king. This was a strategy that even 1 month ago would have been unthinkable to them.Anyway, I defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics, dialogue, and strategies. I am sure that at some point, my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer.But for now I couldn't be happier with the Chesster and Fritz games! My kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess - and not just ""computer chess"", but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club - not to mention me.I think I'm going to go demand a rematch :)"
37115,0,"A decent program, seeing as you probably won't find Norway galore at your local bookstore (I know I didn't), it's a good way to familiarize yourself with the language, just don't expect to learn too much. You learn basic basic words, and a few phrases, and the record feature is definitely helpful. The format is simple and very easy to understand. My only complaint is that I wish they would have included a little more information. They tell you how to ask/say a few questions/phrases, but never give possible answers, which almost defeats the purpose of asking a question in the first place, if you can't understand the response. Some, but not all, colors, clothing items, and foods are included, but many are left out and it would have been nice to at least been taught the plural forms of words, and the basic verbs, and of course, basic sentence structure. Kind of pointless knowing all those words if you can't put them together. All in all, it's an okay program, a good way to kick things off but after a couple of weeks it'll be pretty useless."

54281,1,"If you're reading this. You are interested in buying Dragon NaturallySpeaking version eight if you are. I highly recommend it! I had versions of Dragon software, dating back to 1995. Let me tell you the software was clunky back then, being a quadriplegic, I used it to type and move the mouse. But as soon as I got a touchpad mouse. I dropped Dragon altogether. Step forward almost 10 years, I decided that I needed to send longer e-mails than two sentences (because that's all I could type, it gets tiring using only one hand and one knuckle on that hand). So I took the plunge drop the cash on Dragon, and after three days am totally satisfied.I added up and running and dictating in less than 20 minutes. The accuracy is amazing I'm actually typing this by voice. Since I can use a touchpad, I do not use the Dragon NaturallySpeaking for mouse commands. But for dictating it is perfect and quick!!!I'm using it with a 2 GHz processor, and it is fine. Getting it set up was a little quirky with my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS. I'm actually using it with a tabletop condenser microphone, not the heads that they came with it (which I found to be quite uncomfortable). Since I'm unable to get the headset on my head, but a tabletop mike is working perfect.So I recommend this product anyone who has a disability that makes typing difficult. Anybody who doesn't want to learn to type (though I think he would be lazy, just suck it up and learn). The software is leaps and bounds above previous versions go for it! Enjoy!"
3501,1,"I ordered the TripMaker by Rand McNally because I misplaced the one I already had and needed it for another computer. It certainly is well worth the buy if you like to travel and want to save some time by letting the TripMaker figure the time and mileage for you. It also gives you your choice of the most scenic or quickest way to go and will map it out for you. It also has other features such as attractions, places to stay and so on. Well worth the buy for the traveler.I ordered this item at Amazon. The price was right and it arrived in excellent condition and in quick order.

34728,0,"After reading all of these reviews, it sounds like Intuit was a tad bit zealous. If that's true about having to buy another license if you switch to a new computer or hard drive, that is very wrong of Intuit. Not everyone copies the software. Give the customer the benefit of the doubt.Question: Does anyone who has installed Turbotax with the accompanying C_Dilla software experienced any problems burning CD's?And can anyone corroborate that the Safecast/C_Dilla stuff actually *does* written data to a hidden area on the hard disk that necessitates a low-level format to remove? Where did this bit of information come from?"
63658,0,"PhotoShop is without a doubt the best digital image editing software on the market. However, Adobe seems to have placed testing of the application on the users who fork over the big bucks and stake their livelihood on its use. If you check the User to User Forum on Adobe's WebSite, you will see the large number of problems people are experiencing with this product. Foremost is speed. Take the minimum system requirements on the box and times those by 4 if you expect it to run efficiently. Also there are many features that either do not work correctly or were just not thought out well when designed. If you are a graphics professional, you will find some of the new features and design a work flow killer. The guides and slice tool are not precise, the text tool is half thought out and there are many features hidden away in right mouse click menus such as text attributes like bold and italic and layer options (you can't rename layers without going to a menu anymore). There is a complete lack of consistency between PhotoShop, ImageReady and Illustrator, which makes no sense at all. I am finding myself switching back and forth between 5.5 and 6. Hopefully, with all of the complaints, Adobe is finding out what real world users need in an application (not what programmers and product people think we need) and are working on a patch."
58387,2,Bought it 3 days ago. Did a page and its beautiful. I had no technical difficulties. I was able to print a beautiful scrap page. I just wished it had more photo realistic accents because I like that look in my pages.

I've also created a &#34;Family Favorite&#34; cookbook that will be passed on to my kids.

It now has more bells and whistles.We have had a problem using their SmartRender progam. It is an option when saving out a video file. We have had to turn it off to prevent locking up the computer. Other than that I love this stuff. I never had a problem with version 7,8,9 or 10. For the price it is great. The program is intuative making it easy to teach others."
2926,1,"Encarta started out about 15 years ago as a premier multimedia electronic encyclopedia, and quickly established itself as a viable computer-based encylopedia to paper ones. Each edition adds a lot of new features, so, in a way, it's become somewhat of ""bloatware,"" but most of its contents are of excellent editorial quality and will please both adults and kids alike. The emphasis on multimedia really makes it shine.This CD version is less convenient than the single-disc DVD version, but is also much cheaper, so I think it's a great value. Get it while the $20 rebate is still good."

62386,1,This software is not top of the line.. therefor isn't promoted as such... or priced as such. I was very pleased with the outcome of it's use. The install was fast and simple (and I was only working with one monitor between two PCs). Transfer time was a bit lengthy but WELL worth the while. I suspect that maybe the other users who had problems were either not very knowledgeable about taking on such a task by themselves... OR they had pre-existing PC problems.I recommend this (for the money).(In quick reference to another review here - nowhere does this product state that it comes with a USB cable for transfer - that comes with the pricier PC transfer software kits - and NO alterations to your PC are necessary).

It was a great purchase and I know the children will be able to do even more with this CD like learning the words and reading. By watching the CD, they can now read the book to me!!!!!!

89589,0,"It is unbelievable to me that Microsoft would charge so much for an upgrade version. The full version isn't much more expensive, so it seems like they aren't giving those of us who have bought a previous version much of a break. The operating system is great, much more stable and faster than anything I've seen Microsoft put out before. Major problems that I have seen so far is with compatibility with hardware, but I'm sure those issues will be cleared up in time as new drivers are released.Windows 2000 would ordinarily be very much deserving of 5 stars, but the outragous price tag brings that rating down. I wonder if they realize that they are actually promoting piracy of their products. Those who can't afford to, or don't want to, spend $200 could just borrow it from a friend and burn it to a blank CD that costs less than $1. Even Apple, with their historically high prices, only charge $89 for their latest OS."
58683,2,"IntelliMover , which is marketed by both Momorex and Detto Technologies, is a software product for transferring (migrating) data from the user's old PC to his/her new one. Unfortunately, it is a poor product that fails to deliver in my experience. Packaging and Websites by Memorex and Detto misleadingly promise that the software will transfer data quickly and easily from the user's old PC to his/her new one. In my experience, it failed miserably. I will never use the product again and recommend that no one buy it.First, except perhaps in fine print hidden somewhere, Memorex and Detto fail clearly to inform the buyer on product packaging or its Websites, that the program does *not* transfer applications.Second, during the transfer IntelliMover is supposed to move all files associated with each program from the old computer to the new one, including those that define the user's personal settings and customizations of said programs. However, in my experience the software did this for only some programs.In sum, I recommend the PC users look elsewhere for solutions to transferring data from an old PC to a new one. Clearly, in my experience the manufacturer overstates what IntelliMover can deliver. In my opinion, the product is poor.James W. Revakjwrevak@villarevak.orgDecember 24, 2003"
7374,0,"We now have seven months experience using Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting 2006 (MSO SBA) to manage accounts for a product development company with a fairly small transaction volume. It has proven adequate for the job, but it has irritating quirks and key limitations. Some scrollbars do not scroll. Some displays jump after they are updated. Some selections take one click, and others take two. Some screens have a button for a function that on other screens is found in a menu. Several displays have extremely poor contrast.The chart of accounts is limited to two levels. In our experience the built-in banking and payroll functions were not usable. They are both tied to vendors: a single bank that has no branches in our area, and a single payroll vendor using a company model with only hourly wages, no direct deposit, and no departments or other cost centers. Reconciliation of accounts is cumbersome and may fail; we use the register checkboxes and a calculator.Microsoft touts the integration of MSO SBA with Office, but we found it of limited use. After forms such as invoices are exported to Word, extra work is needed to format them because MSO SBA provides rigid models and no macros. Potential usefulness of Excel is limited because, out-of-the-box, MSO SBA can only export. However, we found a reasonably priced add-in from DpDynamics of Morgantown, WV, that imports transactions from Excel. We currently use it in combination with data downloads from our payroll vendor to implement a departmental payroll, and we are planning to use it to calculate and import sales commissions and multistate sales taxes.At the Amazon price, MSO SBA is a bargain, provided you are willing to ride out its quirks and do some work on the side as we do with the DpDynamics add-in. We have two network-coupled copies in the office and got a third for our accountant. We installed each of the three service packs issued to date. So far, we have had no trouble with essential functions and no garbled data or data loss."
18816,2,"I know, I'm an adult- don't even have kids so what am I doing with this game? Well, I'm interested in games, have not been entirely satisfied with the ea sports games I've tried and heard good things about this series, so when I ran across a cheap 2005 hockey I thought I'd try it out. I found it disappointing enough that I probably would not try another backyard game and would not really recommend this to anyone be they 6 or 600.I've rated it on the following factors that are important to me.Story: B-, okay, it's a sports game- no story, but the commentators are amusing and the little goal dances are cuteCharacters: B, I could care less about the real hockey players as kids stuff, but the create your own player thing (which I often find limited and/or boring in games) is reasonably simple, yet cute, and I was able to make versions of people I know sometimes with success.Gameplay: D-, starts falling apart here most crucially. The simple mostly mouse only controls are okay, you win some and lose some with it- less control, but nice and simple. but unfortunatly things like what sort of situation would make you score a goal are very off and don't make sense to me. The power ups are cute but sort of ruin the game as some of them basically provide free goals. Better just have easier to score goals. Too much of the game revolved around the power ups. And I know its for kids, and that maybe the idea is if you can't score too easily then wait till you get an under icer (the puck goes under the ice when you shoot so no one can stop it) and you'll get a goal, but why not just make it so that on easy setting, at least, if you get a decent shot off in the open it might actually go in? also, what about getting to control your goalie! This would be a very big improvement if you could go into goalie mode or something.Graphics: C+, pleasant. They work. Rinks could really be a little cuter.Dreariness factor: B, sunny and positive, you don't spend hours in dank corridors killing aliens, which is usually a nice change from other games-even some kid ones.Technical issues: I had no problems on a mid range system.Learning factor: D, I know it's simple, but that just means they could have put in a nice, very thorough, tutorial without too much effort. In the time before I gave up on this game it seemed you don't so much get better as just figure out how it works.Product materials: D, tiny booklet, could use a little more information, tips, etc.Chore factor: C, didn't make it through a whole season- almost did. Was a bit of a slog.Difficulty: F, it's a kids game for, um, cripes sake, easy setting is way too hard really, though it's not terribly hard to win at any setting. And even on easy I think the computer cheats. I suspect the other team makes goals I never make in the same situation. i could be wrong on that, but... And just for once I'd like to see a sports game where the easy setting means that not paying too close attention or being too careful I can win 11 to 2. Paying good attention and really concentrating after a few games I should be able to win 15 to nothing. In this game, paying good attention I could win, oh, maybe 8 to 3. I know there are loads of 9 year olds who could do better, but there are also a lot who can't.Game saves: C, adequate, quite a few menus. Can't save during games, which would have maybe been nice, but would probably just be trouble for me as i'd try and perfect my games or something, though in this game that ability would maybe be an improvement.Other: D+, all that league stuff with real teams and all seemed a bit of a waste as its sort of too huge a league. It would be more fun if it were more intimate and teams had a bit more personality. They should also make a lot more out of stats and have player rankings and stuff like that. They touch on it with all star voting which is a good start, but kind of thin. There are awards at the end of the season I didn't get to, but it sounds hopeful. I really like a feature where you get news and certificates like `so and so got her first hat trick' and would have liked even more of that."

Turbo Tax for 2006 loads quickly, simply updates when necessary, includes your State version and it's step-by-step questions/answers are seamless. The interface to the previous year's tax return make Turbo-tax a no-brainer for repeated use. I use Quickbooks Pro (which I also Beta Test and it. too integrated flawlessly.

66725,0,"This is a pretty good product if you have LPs or other music sources you've encoded to MP3. I tried it for music I recorded off the radio onto my MP3 player.The problem with it is that it doesn't allow you to split tracks by selecting sections of it. So if you have a song, like some of Tori Amos' tunes, that have silent pauses during the track, the auto-splitter built into the program will break 1 song into multiple MP3 files. You can go back and join them together but that's a pain. If it gave you a visual mapping of the track so you could highlight sections you want, it would vastly improve the program.Other problem with it is you can't add the MP3 tags in the program. You have to save the MP3s and then add the Tags using MusicMatch or other player.So, not bad for tasks like recording LPs where you already know the start/stop times of the tracks. Not nearly sufficient for breaking mixes or large MP3s that you don't have the break time for songs for."

While it does say on the box and common marketing material that it supports multiple displays, what it does not point out is that this is only true (PC) if you have a video card-PER-display!

46315,0,"Once you get the hang of it, though, the program is powerful. Be prepared to waste several CD's and a lot of time practicing.Some pitfalls of this program:1. Difficult to install. The program insists on installing DirectX 6.2, even when you have a later version of DirectX. This causes the program to lock up. Once it locks up, you must reboot, then the program will not run nor will it uninstall. (The secret to uninstalling is to delete the magix.ini file, and then delete the installation folder. Your registry is still messed up, though). Be wary of using an uninstaller in the background too. It doesn't like them.2. Difficult program to learn and the manual is difficult to understand. The awkward wording suggests the book was written in German than translated into English.3. Limited MP3 support - the program allows only 20 MP3 uses. After than, you must pay an additional fee to export your files to MP3.4. It will not burn CD's when Easy CD Creator is installed, although all the other functions will work. For some reason, It doesn't like EasyCD Creator. It works properly with Nero 5.5."

42667,1,"The updated interface for this version of Office is superb. There are many people who have been complaining about the interface redesign (ribbon bar ,etc...), but one must take into account that people in general simply don't like change, and will complain non-stop whenever something changes. I am a fairly advanced user of Word, and the changes to the interface have only made me a better user. I've now been able to find and use features that I didn't even know existed, and this is a big help.If you are a user of the old versions, yes, it will be a change, but you must take a step back and evaluate the interface for what it is. Drop your preconceived notions about what you want it to be. Also, it's time for a reality check, since these changes are not going away, so you might as well get used to it.If you're a new user to Office, you will have no problem using the interface and you will probably learn how to use it faster and better than it took people to learn the older versions."
66083,0,"I first saw this software at the local Office Depot and found the idea of recording off of internet radio interesting enough to buy a copy. I mean, with the RIAA trying to sue file sharing people out of existence I needed to find a safer alternative to my favorites: Limewire and WinMX.OK, first the good stuff:1. It does do what it claims. You can record off of internet radio stations.2. The sound quality is very good (on some stations), rivaling that found on CD's. You need to select a station that is 128 bitrate with a 44,100 sample rate.3. It will allow you to record several different audio streams simultaneously which is a very nice feature.4. You CAN burn CD's with this software. Not a big deal these days but, hey, it works.Here are the negatives:1. Audio Xtract does not advertise the fact that it is compatible with only one format of internet radio, something called ShoutCast. I found this out by digging through the FAQ's on the company's website (see link: http://secure.nsscheckout.com/solo/customers/support.asp?AID=2452290&mode;=FAQ). So, if you want to record your local station and it isn't supported by AudioXtract then you are out of luck.BTW: If you are seriously condsidering purchasing this product then you should carefully read ALL of the FAQ's posted on their site.2. There are frequent dropouts of the streams (at least this was what I experienced with the stations that I was interested in). This is, of course, very annoying. The FAQ for this blames internet traffic and the station. This makes sense. However, since AudioXtract only supports one type of station software, this heavy traffic may be caused by AudioXtract users.3. Sometimes everything locks up. The FAQ for this says that this is a known problem (read: bug) and that they are working on it. Hmmm.4. Sometimes you can't connect to a station on the list. See #2 for probable explanation.5. The songs are chopped by the program based on the info broadcast by the station. This means that unless the station is dead-on (unlikely) you end up with cuts that are way, way off. In other words, the beginning of a song is late and the tail end of the song has the beginning of another one spliced on. Not exactly as automatic as they would have you believe. There is a way around this, though. You can record the station stream as one big file (it is an option in the software) and then use a sound editing program to chop it up yourself. Well, this is OK as long as you can find a station that doesn't fade one song into another or have a DJ talk over the music. Once again, it may be hard to find a station that doesn't do that because of the limited number of AudioXtract compatible stations that are available.[...]"

I admit I may have a little different perspective since I'm an accountant. Some people have problems with programs because they don't have the background in accounting to understand some functions. I have used Multiledger to keep the books of several clients companies and have never had any trouble doing anything that was needed. I have also recommended it and trained others to use it.

I wanted to play it again and the price was fair.It is a fun theme park game where you build a park and try to keep customers happy by adding a variety of rides, shops, places to eat, and vegatation. It recommends ages 6 to 12 but fun for older LegoLand fans as well.------For people with Windows XP/Vista:I used Custom Install and chose everything (about 440 MB of space) for maximum compatibility but it ran fine in the normal install (220 MB).It will not run in Windows Vista NATIVE MODE but all you have to do is right click on the icon and set it for Windows 98 compatibility mode. After that, it works fine. Windows XP/Vista has quite a few choices on programs made for older operating systems. In the case of LegoLand, I set it for ""Run as Administrator"" and ""Windows 98/Me"" compatibility. I had absolutely no problem with graphics, video, sound, timing or even game saves.As always, it is recommended to download all Windows Updates so your computer is up to date."

With this product you're forced to design a house and then focus on a specific room. I live in an area where there are alot of raised houses. A raised foundation/house on piers is not an option. I will say that it has a nice selection of finishes, though many of them look too similar to tell a difference. Overall, it's a decent product and not a bad buy."

Even after several weeks, I am still finding new things I like about this OS. I had relatively few issues with apps that no longer worked after the upgrade.

I installed my hard drive, loaded my Windows XP - home edition and then loaded Norton Internet Security 2005. It's been the best little investment. It was not difficult to set up, hasn't been difficult to use and it works wonders - I now surf the web without any aggravating pop-ups.

These days companies are creating more formats for digital media, but I like that the program has tried to keep that complication away from the interface. The photo program has also been altered. I can go to the tools more easily than before. There used to be more wizards but this didn't always work well for photo editing. Nice to see that someone is constantly tweaking the programs to make them more usable.I just came back from a short vacation and used a digital camera. You can go directly from the camera to a disc now, bypassing hard drive transfer. This worked out well since I brought an old pc w/o much space. I've also tried the liveshare feature which emails thumbsize pictures so you don't have to send large files. The email receivers can click on the thumbnails and get the full size photos.

83489,1,"I have been using another Photoshop version (LE or Limited Edition) for about a year now and am generally very happy with it. While it is not as powerful as many professional graphics programs, it is enough for my limited use and ability. However, I've heard good things about Elements and Amazon's price (including a big rebate) was so great I decided it was time to buy it.I ordered it and while waiting for it to arrive, decided to look into the new features and learn the basics of how it works. I went to the Adobe web site and found a 30-day trial version I could download. I installed the trial version and took a look and was surprised to basically find LE with a better interface. While it has some improvements over LE, there are not many and it was mostly just simplified editing tools. After a day of exploring and testing, I returned to Amazon and cancelled my order (sorry Amazon!)If you don't have either of these programs and you are an amateur or novice graphics person looking for a basic graphic/photo editing program, I would definitely go with Elements -- it has everything LE has plus more. I've tried a number of other programs and Photoshop is my overwhelming favorite. For that reason it gets five stars. But my only note of caution is just for those looking to upgrade from LE. I would suggest you download the trail version first and see if it is really worth the investment. For me it wasn't, but it probably depends on what features are important to you.And actually, even if you have not used LE, you may want to go to Adobe's web site and try it out first anyway. I appreciate when software makers do this so we can take it for a test drive. It suggests to me that Adobe is confident in their product and they believe that after trying it you will like it and want to buy it."

Why can't a computer program do math now?The new ""Savings and Spending budgeting"" doesn't have an obvious autobudget to insert a value depending on your previous history so you have to hand tweak this now. It's also pretty gimmicky as it doesn't rely on any published peer-reviewed economic methods, but some ""bright"" idea by a MSN exec.

They told me which mode I should start with, explained me that the software is based on immersion, so it is normal you listen right away to Spanish words or sentences...Once I picked that up and used the translation icon, I was on my way to start talking Spanish at work.

51263,1,"This is a 'must have' software if you hike, bike and recreate outdoors. The software interface takes a bit of getting use to, but once mastered it provides simple navigation and a lot of information. I do a lot of mountain biking in Northern California and this software lets you 'preview' a trail by mapping it (you draw a line on the trail) and the software then calculates distance travelled and the cumulative vertical ascent. This is very helpful in determining how long a ride will take, and how much physical exertion will be required. It also helps you to track your condition level - as you get in better shape you will be able to do more vertical in less time ...Once you have created a route you can send it (via e-mail) to friends, or post it on the Topo website to share with others. Other neat features are a 3 dimensional viewing package (sold separately fo $20) and the ablity to send waypoints to handheld GPS units.There really aren't any 'cons' to the software. Some things you should be aware of though are that Garmin (maker of many handheld GPS units) promotes its own topographical software. This is a pain because Garmin only allows you to send waypoints form the 'Topo' software and you can't upload the detailed maps into the handheld GPS unit. I own an Extrex Vista and the inability to load maps without buying the Garmin software is an irratant. The only other comment is that some of the maps in the software are dated so they don't always show the latest information in terms of roads and buildings. This you just get used to. Similar to other posts - When hiking or biking in remote areas don't rely on a handheld GPS exclusively, bring a printed map, and have some familiarity with a compass and know generally the area into which you are going - also let other people know where you are going (send an e-mail of your route ...). This is common sense that will save a lot of headache.Overall this software is 'a good thing' and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy spending time outside, and it is particularly good for the mountain biking community."

I use & like Money2002, and since Microsoft owns Kiplinger, I thought I'd give it a shot. It worked great! E-filing was a breeze. My fed refund was in my checking account in 7 days, my state, one week later. It's a better value than TurboTax too..."
36674,1,"This is a really good deal for the money, I think it is well worth more than the 2.99. It really shows you how to start typing and has practice drills and it tracks your progress after each lesson. It also has lessons for the advanced typer like how to improve your accuracy and speed. And it has 3 typing skills games too. Since Amazon did not provide any info about this CD I will tell you excatly what the back of this program reads: &quot;START TYPING TODAY! TYPING IS THE ULTIMATE TYPING TEACHER! COMBINING EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNIQUES WITH EASY-TO-USE MENUS, YOU WILL LEARN TOUCH TYPING QUICKLY &amp; EASILY.

88786,1,"Not as good as V the original Movie or V the Miniseries, but it was fun watching the miniseries anyway. I saw some of the episodes already but not most of them. As I stated in the title, the Miniseries was not as good as the main movie or final battle but some of the episodes were alright. It's almost as if they ran out of good plots to run with (probably why it got cancelled). Plus it did't have a very good ending in my opionion (again Probably because it got cancelled) & they probably didt have time to plan a better ending. Some of the scenes as far the as ships flying are from the original movie I think & some of the episodes go into trying to be love story scenes & are kinda boring but some of the battle scenes are good especially neat if you like V & haven't seen them. One other thing, that I thought about a couple of times as I watching the miniseries was that everytime the visitors planned an attack (which almost always failed) was that they seem to never have enough troops & with the big mother ship & all the other ships you would of thought they would of sent like 100's of troops kinda like when they first landed & came down to meet everyone when they playing the star wars theme in the original movie, but in the miniseries there was always no more than I would say 20-25 visitors trying to attack the resistants & even if there was only 2-4 resistants fighting all 25 visitors, the visitors would almost always lose, not that I was routing for the visitors but you would of just thought they would of sent 50-250 at a time especially after failing to win time & time again. But anyway it's worth watching only if for nostagia 80's V sci-fi memories."

The best part is that it comes with a lot of built in features that are like a lot of Norton Utilities. However, the only draw back to this product is the fact that it can only be installed on one computer."

It has GST Input and Output Tax features and has fantastic GST reports to track the purchases and sales. The GST reports produced are what the GST Comptroller wants.3. I have been using QB since 1993!!! and have been buying the upgrades since then. Currently already using 2010 version.4. Quickbooks is smart to make money from users. They have upgrades every year. After 2 years, you are forced to upgrade because QB does not support the old versions and the email invoicing feature does not work. If you want to continue using this email invoicing, you just have to pay and upgrade. It is very good in the internet age where you can email to customers the invoices in pdf format.5. The Project or Job feature is very good to track your events, customers, projects, activities and see if those projects make money.6. Produced very good reports.7. You can sure that you have an upgrade every year and you just pay to get it. If you dont need, upgrade every 2 years to get continued support for your software version.8. Very stable software.9. SG users can email me if you need help."

92887,1,"I have used WordPerfect and Quattro almost from their inception, so I have seen both of them improve over many years. Those years of practise have resulted in WordPerfect Office X3, a really outstanding product.Because many other organizations and people that I work with use MS Word and MS Excel, in the past I have had no choice but to grudingly use them in response. Now, however, WordPerfect and QuatroPro can translate Word and Excel, incoming and outgoing. Therefore, I no longer have to maintain two Office programs.Many years of using WP Office have probably prejudiced me, but I find it more user friendly than MS Office; however, the biggest difference is that Corel is responsive and helpful whereas MS is almost impossible to deal with."

I only bought it because I could not get Visual Basic 6.This is nothing like the earlier BASIC systems. For example: it take a full page of code just to print one line to a printer.Somewhere along the line Microsoft has forgotten the concept that BASIC stands for Beginners All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. This is a complex language intended to produce Web XML pages. It integrates Microsofts TOTAL demand to stick to windows and windows forms.This also comes with ZERO documentation. There is a small book to get you started on a simple project, but the on-line reference is useless.Plan on spending [money] on books including a language reference to even do the simplest things."

The software with its interview format worked for me, was able to save my return as pdf and e-file without a hassle. The only real pain was getting the updates. I had to go to Intuit's website to look for info and play around with my broadband connection to get the updates to download.My return has gotten easier over the past few years but with the update annoyance, I may just buy TaxCut next year. I don't import last year's stuff so Intuit - give me a reason to get TurboTax 2004."
29284,0,"Jasc's Photo Paint Shop Album (PPSA) Version 5.0.1 is a nice upgrade to version 4 that puts the program on equal or slightly better footing with ACDSystem's ACDSee version 6 and Adobe's PhotoShop Album (PSA) version 2. Version 5 introduces a prettier interface; adds a calendar-based organizational view, a bunch of creative project and print templates - for coffee books, CD/DVD labels, calendars, etc.; and some basic archival features. PPSA's strength is that it bundles together the most variety of features of any consumer-grade digital media library manager, and that makes Paint Shop Photo Album the most well-rounded choice for mainstream beginner and intermediate users new to digital image management.With the addition of creative project templates, Photo Paint Shop Album 5 becomes a better choice than Adobe PhotoShop Album 2. The latter's crippling weakness is that it is unable to automatically detect and synchronize new or deleted photographs to and from its internal catalog database. Unlike ACDSee 6 and PhotoShow Deluxe 3, PPSA's creative projects are things users may print themselves. ACDSee and PhotoShow Deluxe simply supply links to websites (Snapfish, etc.) where users order and pay for their own creations.Consumers should understand that given Photo Paint Shop Album's low price, competitor programs may exceed the depth of any particular module(s) in PPSA. For example, ACDSee has the better file-level manager. Simple Star's PhotoShow Deluxe 3 has the better slideshow module. With these other choices however, users may find themselves purchasing additional programs to match the breadth of Photo Paint Shop Album's functionality.If there is a weakness to Photo Paint Shop Album, it is metadata. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but not always. Without aid, the casual viewer may not understand a picture's content or context. (E.g., When and where was this picture taken? What is this a picture of? Who are these people?) Even the photographer himself may not remember these things one or five years later. Metadata is the useful mnemonic device that stores this information.Photo Paint Shop Album locks picture metadata (image title, description, and keyword category) inside a proprietary database instead of supporting the EXIF and IPTC metadata standards (which embed metadata inside the picture file). PPSA users therefore cannot easily share a complete memory with those who do not use Photo Paint Shop Album. Without accompanying metadata, an office party photograph (Office Holiday Party 2004: Roy and his wife Maya, Ciara and Laura. Unbeknownst to Maya, Ciara is Roy's workplace mistress.) quickly becomes just another picture. As digital photograph collections become mainstream, support for EXIF and IPTC metadata should become only more important, to provide a standard, seamless way to share, search for and organize images based on timestamp and picture caption content - among a user's chosen image manager, online photo-sharing service (such as Fotki.com), and family and friends (who may use something other than Photo Paint Shop Album). PPSA users who want to share picture metadata with other users must manually copy and paste it for each picture they want to share.In Version 5, Paint Shop Photo Album's continued lack of EXIF and IPTC metadata support becomes a functional liability. Version 5's new Calendar View utilizes EXIF timestamp information to create its timeline-based organizational view of pictures, but ironically, the program lacks an EXIF editor. Users who want to scan and organize their shoeboxes of old photographs and film negatives, and those who order picture CD's along with their analog film developing orders cannot take full advantage of PPSA's Calendar View. PPSA sorts pictures lacking EXIF timestamps by the file system's Last Modified Date, because the program cannot timestamp the original date the photograph was taken. Fortunately, users can turn to freeware EXIF metadata editors to mitigate this issue, such as Exifer (http://www.exifer.friedemann.info).Despite PPSA's letdown on EXIF and IPTC metadata support, most consumer-grade digital media library managers also still do poorly in metadata management, which sort of defeats the purpose of their existence. Of Paint Shop Photo Album's competitors, only ACDSee has EXIF metadata editing abilities, and therefore, a fully-functional Calendar View.Jasc's Paint Shop Photo Album 5 is a well-rounded introduction to digital image library management. Curious users may quickly outgrow PPSA's rudimentary implementations of many features and look for more advanced software, but Paint Shop Photo Album 5 introduces people to more exciting possibilities of digital photography and digital image library management than its competitors."

The next time I buy a GPS system (which I will}, I will look more closely at the cost of the upgrades and accessories necessary to use it. I think Garmin will come out very low on my list and I probably will choose another brand."
6259,1,"I bought the Office 2004 upgrade, finally, because certain minor misfits of Office X with current versions of Mac OS X became too annoying. It is an improvement. Those annoying crashes and refusals to bring the desired window to the front disappeared. It has a few nice formatting improvements, such as Page view in Excel. Powerpoint seems a little more refined. I thought that I'd like Word's notebook view, because I used the stand-alone product on Windows. I have not found it useful, however, partly because I like the Circus Ponies products."

13004,0,"I did NOT use the e-file provision, simply because I WILL NOT allow Intuit Inc. to see my tax return, especially in an electronic form they can search and hide away and whatever.There is no physical need for Intuit to be an intermediary for e-filing: the software could easily be made to communicate the forms directly back to the IRS computers. When that change is made, I will efile, BUT NOT BEFORE.Otherwise, this software more or less just walks you through the forms in somewhat-plain language, and does the math and most of the copying for you. I guess it's worth its small price."
56980,1,"After reading some of the reviews here (which may have been based on old hardware or software) I decided to buy one based on Pantone's reputation. NOTE: Be SURE to download the latest software from the Pantone website... the CD in the box had 1.0 on it... there is a Version 1.5 now.I have a Mac Pro with two Nvidia 8800GT video cards, and a slightly unusual monitor configuration with a fairly new Apple 30"" Cinema display in the middle, flanked by two older 20.1"" Viewsonic VP2000s monitors. The Viewsonics pivot 90 degrees on their stands to be 1200x1600 and are a great match to the Cinema display's 2560x1600... so they are all the same ""height"" in pixels, and are extremely close in DPI.But try as I might, I could not manually adjust the color of the Viewsonics to come anywhere close to the Apple display... which was pretty jarring to work with all day.Just ran a calibration with the HueyPro on all three monitors... and it is amazingly good. The older Viewsonics just do not have the brightness and contrast capability of the Apple display, but now the color balance of the three is very close. The Mac Leopard UI gray window toolbars are very neutral looking on all three displays... and it even corrected a noticeable blue cast on the newer Apple display.Considering the non-trivial dollars in this computer/monitor setup, this was an amazing difference for a hundred bucks! So much so that I am almost annoyed Apple doesn't ship one of these with every 30"" display given its price :-)"

4752,1,"This is a combo pack of Norton's Anti-virus software, personal firewall, and anti-spam programs that are all sold individually as well. The price of buying this complete all-in-one package is a great value. I upgraded from NIS '02- which worked great for me, the '04 version is the latest, improved, and most up to date. I love the easy to use interface and automatic live updates (via the 'net). No computer should ever be connected to the 'net with out protection from viruses, cowardly hackers, and privacy threats. It does it's job, easy to install and use, and most importantly keeps my PC safe. Great product, must have, Highly recommended !!"
2312,1,"This is a great program to use for anyone looking for a more enhanced version of MS Paint. It has tons of features, and any well-trained user can really use PS to its true max. The program does take a bit of time to learn however, just not to know what the different tools are, but to use each one to see what they do, and the knowledge of when to apply them. I use it often, from basic photo editing, screen captures, full-art (I use it for Deviantart and stuff) and just fun. I've been using it for a while and still basically a novice, so that should give you an idea of how powerful it is. However, the price holds many people back, but any person with a bit of internet experience can find cheaper versions. Great progam all-in-all."

3685,1,"This is almost perfect in terms of features and interface. The new formats added since 7.5 make a lot of sense. I myself have upgraded to a dual layer dvd burner and set up stereo sound to my dvd player. EMC8 has the support for my new set up. Now I can burn dvds for playing on the dvd player, but best of all I can make dolby music dvds. I think that music cds may become obsolete and dvds and mp3 players are the way to go. I prefer dvds for music right now because higher end capacity digital players are majorily expensive. I can fit 40 hours plus on a dual layer disc. For tv watching I have a cable dvr instead of tivo, but with the software I figured out a way to transfer programs to my pc. If only we could transfer movies legitimately for personal use. I know that Hollywood and company are worried about copyright infringement and pirating, but since I buy legitmate dvds and just want the option of viewing on my pc I have to go about it in a roundabout way. I transfer from dvr to vhs and then to pc. The good part about EMC8 is that it handles the video transfer from start to finish. I can cut out ads and extras easily so the file is managable. The video merging feature let's me put the program parts back together. I'm extremely satisfied with the program as I now have control over my music and video."
19555,1,"My husband bought this game for me, and he and I spent hours playing as a team - we had a great time together and found it very satifying working together (it was amusing to me to discover what my strengths were compared with his, and it was entertaining learning to complement each other with those strengths) to beat the clock and finish a puzzle in time! We both love the variety in different places to hunt for clues, and the challenge of being in the same scene but having different clues to find!We also play alone, under our own name, and we talk about how much slower it is for each of us to find the clues ... playing on your own is fun (and competing with someone else to see who can get to the next level first), playing as a team is even more fun.I like how this game encourages vocabulary growth ... I've had to use the dictionary more than once to figure out what I was supposed to be looking for! I don't have much time to play computer games, but I've gotten quickly hooked and sneak a level in whenever I can (it's nice to be able to leave at any point and not have to start all over again later)!"
61076,1,"This was my absolute favorite game to play in school! Maybe you think I only liked it because we got to play it in school, and any game would beat doing schoolwork, but you would be mistaken. This game(and pretty much all the Mecc or The Learning Company games in fact), is so much fun, and it's educational at the same time, how many games can say that? You play as Muncher, some kind of frog thing, and you are on a black screen of rows and columns of numbers with a title at the top that says ""Munch multiples of 4"" or something along those lines, and you just move Muncher along the blocks and munch the correct numbers. But watch out, while all this is going on the Troggles are coming after you that have only one purpose in life, to eat Muncher! This game is an epic battle for survival! But just keep munching the correct numbers and stay away from the Troggles and you'll be fine. Every 3 levels you get to see a cute cut scene where the Troggles are up to no good but Muncher always outsmarts them and laughs in their face, in his primitive MIDI format laugh, it's so cute.The only bad things I can say about this game is when playing multiples it only goes up to multiples of 20, I wish it would have gone further. Also I wish there would have been more cut scenes, after you get far enough in the game they just repeat, that's just lazy. Another thing, this game came out in the late 80's I believe, so don't expect some spectacular graphics, but so what, graphics do not make the game, gameplay makes the game.This game has a major nostalgic battle for me and I'm sure it does to anyone else who remembers playing it. I was the queen of the computer lab when I sat down to play this. The biggest challenge was to see if I could beat it before the class was over, and as long as the moron kid next to me wasn't all up in my kool-aid I could beat it in time. I don't understand why kids today aren't playing this game in school. Maybe that's why they're so screwed up. Bring Number Munchers back to computer labs everywhere!PS For anyone whos wanting to play this game but has windows 7 like me, they're is a thing called DOSBOX that will allow you to play games such as this one and others like Oregon Trail, Duke Nukem, Doom, and all the others. Just Google it. Have fun."
31316,1,"This is where Marvel comics as we know it today really began. My main interest begins with Fantastic Four #1 in '61, and then FF #232 in '81 by John Byrne, but there are many other issues & runs I like in this collection.Highlights here for me...Issues 1 to 102, 108- Jack Kirby, starting in '61.Issues 232 to 293- John Byrne, starting in '81.Issues 296 to 309- John & Sal Buscema, starting in '86.Issues 334 to 354- Walt Simonson, starting in '89.It's amazing to me we get 44 years of comics on a single disc! It's interesting to see issues with Jim Lee & Heroes Reborn, as well as runs with creators like George Perez, Alan Davis, Carlos Pacheco, Salvador Larroca, Mike Wieringo, and Paul Ryan. If you're thinking about buying FF trade paperbacks and Masterworks collections, this is a great way to preview these issues *before* you buy. And as others have pointed out, while thenewer editionof this software contains more content at the same list price, Amazon currently offers this 1st edition DVD at a discount, so it's still worth getting in my opinion. It's a fantastically *great* way to save time, space & money!P.S. I had technical difficulties with the Avengers version of this software by GITCorp. I include the problem here just in case it helps someone. Some people will only be able to see the 1960s folder. My computer is running both Windows 2000 & XP. In Windows 2000, I couldn't for the life of me get my computer to see more than that 1st folder. It's as if that's *all* that's on the disc. Gitcorp thinks CD packet writing software on a person's computer will interfere with the way the disc is viewed, so they recommend uninstalling packet writing software like Roxio to see if that'll help. It didn't. I tried rebooting in Safe Mode, uninstalling programs, reinstalling programs: nothing I tried could make the disc readable. Switching to XP though ""fixed"" the problem immediately. In my Windows XP installation, this DVD's contents were easily readable. Sure enough, the *entire* contents were now there. I should note that I don't use Roxio or Nero software in XP, so if XP users are having this problem, that might be it. I *only* experienced this issue with Windows 2000.The problem is in the way the disc was made. All the content is really there, but some computers can't read more than the first folder, so you might think that's all that's on the disc. Getting a replacement disc won't help: all copies of the Avengers gitcorp made are like this: viewable on some computers, not on others. Many people just take this disc to another computer and copy its contents there. You can copy onto CDs, DVDs, hard drives, etc. and then bring that info back to your original computer."
6954,1,At least this doesn't scatter files all over my hard drive. I bought it on a recommendation from an all digital music studio owner. I complained that I didn't like Norton Utilities because you could never clean all the files off your dirve and it did disk save stuff that I couldn't turn off. Now after using TechTool I'm impressed that it only did what I wanted it to do which was to defrag my disk. It has a lot of other tools in it's kit but they didn't self install and clutter up my drive. It allowed me to use only the features I wanted without loading up my dirve with stuff I didn't want. I too will be recommending this product.

It was a great decision.As a the owner of a web design and development shop, I have already found uses for InDesign CS and Illustrator CS, programs I never thought I would use.My favorite part of this program is the file management system. It is easy to use and convenient.One drawback is the upgrade does not come with documentation. There are web based PDFs, but no books. It is daunting for an old dog like myself to open a new program - particularly one as complex as this one - and start a new project. There is a CD with video lessons that helped, but nothing beats a book in your lap when you are lost."

78876,1,"This starter kit is awesome! In about 3 simple steps you can be downloading and watching movies, tv shows, or any other programs you choose(cds, games, etc.) I'm not very computer-savvy, and with this product I just slipped in the disc and voila! Access to any movies or tv shows I wanted. The instructions are easy to follow, with lots of advice and sites to visit to learn more about what's available in the growing bittorrent file-sharing phenomenon! The programs on the disc were a snap to download. I highly recommend this product!"
63008,1,"(1) You will notice a speed increase on any Mac that fits the specs. Boot time is sliced almost in half on my dual processor G5, and by a third on an older G4 tower. They've obviously put a lot of effort into optimizing the OS code and bringing a new level of ""snappiness"" to OS X's already quick performance. In my opinion, the speed improvement is reason alone to get Tiger ... it's that impressive.(2) As with other OS X upgrades, I'd suggest a fresh install, wiping the hard drive completely (backing up your stuff, of course, first!), not an upgrade install or ""clean"" install. I've tried both and, frankly, the fresh install on a pristine hard drive has a better ""feel"" to it and, if experience is any guide, will reduce problems down the line.(3) Spotlight is everything it's claimed to be. However ... your computer may seem to be acting oddly for the first hour or so as Spotlight (I assume) creates an index. Once that's done, you're flying.This is an amazing upgrade ... well worth the wait and the price. What I love most is the continuing attention to detail ... the cool visual effects with widgets are but one example. Launch a widget and the entire desktop ripples like cool, clear water. I'm still having fun with that!Windows is now way behind ... or is that a cloud of dust a few miles back?"
24900,1,"This product does what is otherwise impossible: shrinks a partition without disturbing the data therein.Also it works very fast! It takes just a minute or two to shrink or expand a partition.It has always worked for me. If you wonder why you would need this software, don't worry about it. If you need it, you know it. And when you need it, this is the only program on earth that will do this work.When you need it and it works it is AWESOME!Here's an example:Say you have a teaching lab with 8 computers. You want to use Power Quest Drive Image to create a clone of the hard disk on computer #1 on CD. Then every Friday night after class you can restore the image on all 8 computers and Monday morning all your computers are fresh and ready, regardless of what last week's students did.Computer #1 has a 100 GB hard drive in a single partition, but only 1GB is actually in use. The rest is free space. Since Drive Image backs up a partition at a time, you will need enough CDs to hold 100GB of compressed data, even though most of it will just be zeros. That might take you many CDs. What you need is a way to shrink the partition size down to just the 1GB in use. Conventional tools will not allow you to do this....they erase all the data in the partition if you shrink it. That kills you! That forces you to back up all the data to another hard drive, delete the partition, recreate the partition to the 1GB size, then format the partition, then reload the data from the spare hard drive, if possible, then create your Drive Image CD, and then go to through the whole process again to expand the partition back. This could take all day.With Partition Magic, you just insert a diskette and about two minutes later you are done shrinking the partition to the needed size! Snap your image CD and then fire up Partition Magic again and in another two minutes the partition is back where it started! With this technology available doing it the old way makes about as much sense as using a Radio Shack cassette tape player for data storage on your IBM-PC instead of a hard drive.The former owner of this program, Power Quest, was granted several patents on this technique. Check it out at www.uspto.gov - it's fascinating reading. Paraphrasing their words: obviously this function is not easy since it took 15 years from the introduction of the IBM-PC for someone to invent it."
37501,1,"From high school student to professional, it you are at all serious about scholarly writing or even just expect to do a lot of it (whether you like it or not), this product is for you! My productivity has skyrocketed since I purchased EndNote last year. Sure, there are some improvements that could be made, but all in all, a fantastic product!Here's how it works: EndNote builds a database of information about the articles, books, and other items you want to cite in your paper. You fill in a template with the bits of information needed to cite a source properly, which might vary for an edited book, a web site, or whatever type of source you are using. (You can even type in or scan in text from your sources as well.) Then, as you write your paper in Word or WordPerfect, you will find an added EndNote toolbar along the top of your page. After you type in something you want to cite, click to open the list of sources, and drop the one you want into the paper. (At this point I always edit the citation by adding the page number). EndNote *automatically* puts this citation into the citation style you choose, and at the same time generates a &quot;works cited&quot; list at the end of the file. It's that simple!!And even better: if you need to change the citation style -- say you wrote it in MLA style but are submitting to an APA style journal -- it just takes a few clicks to change the style! I have had to go back and clean up citations once or twice when doing this, but it's a lot easier than re-doing the whole paper.Another nice feature is the ability to download citations directly from some databases and library catalogs, saving you keystrokes. It's a nice program to use to keep track of your personal library as well, since it has searchable keyword fields.I highly recommend this program! If you are a student contemplating a few years of serious writing in college, this will save you an enormous amount of time. If you write scholarly articles, this will keep you so organized you will have hours more time for research. And if you just collect books and articles of topics that interest you, it's still a great way to keep your information organized."
79789,1,"I used TaxCut on years '00 & '01, and TurboTax the last two years. I definitely prefer TurboTax -- the organization and design of the software is less headache-inducing, and the ""interview"" questions are just better-written. I can remember instances with TC where I had to simply guess as to what information goes where.Yes, it can be annoying that the cash register rings everytime you want to do something (do your state taxes, file online, etc.) and you have to go through a rebate process to get some of it back. And it does try to sell you other software while you are simply installing the thing. Somehow the overall experience for me is still much less annoying than TaxCut."
45198,1,"I use PowerPDF since January and it works perfect. It creates very small PDF files and I can email them right out of the little window that pops up. A nice feature is also that it lets you preview the PDF before you actually print it into a PDF.Powerpdf saves me tons of paper, especially when printing from my IE 5. Their serial number is a pain to enter during installation, but once it is installed it works wonderfull."

63510,0,"Berlitz Spanish Premium is a good supplement for those learning Spanish in a classroom or through an immersion video or audio course. This program has two strengths. First, it builds vocabulary using Transparent Languages Before You Knew It (BYKI) flashcard system. If you want to test drive BYKI for free, you can download an express version at Transparent's website ([...]). Unfortunately, the Berlitz version doesn't allow you to build your own flashcards which you can do if you buy Transparent's Deluxe BYKI softwareByki Learn Spanish Language Tutor Software & Audio Learning CD-ROM for Windows & Mac - Version 4. However, there are a lot of free BYKI vocabulary lists in many languages on the Transparent site that you can download into the Berlitz software. There are BYKI vocabulary lists for many of the Spanish textbooks used in schools which makes the Berlitz software useful for students. I found this to be a great bonus that the Berlitz documentation doesn't mention.There are mp3 versions of the flashcards which can be imported into iTunes and put on an iPod / iPad. I didn't find this of much value since it includes just the audio and the flashcard itself doesn't show up on the iPod screen.This package bundles in the Berlitz Spanish GuaranteedBerlitz Spanish Guaranteed (Berlitz Guaranteed) (Spanish Edition)audio course which I found helpful to listen to while driving. As another reviewer mentioned, this audio course is for Castilian Spanish not Latin American Spanish so you may find some of the pronunciation unusual. It feels like a completely separate course since there is no connection to the computer course.You won't be fluent in Spanish by using this software, but if you're already taking another course, this software will complement and reinforce what you're learning there."
55495,1,Loved this game...it was cheap when I bought it (can't complain at $0.01) and amused me for hours...wonderful!
75958,0,"I bought this product because two of my friends had it and gave it wonderful reviews. I was told the security/virus features on it were top of the line. That was my biggest concern for I felt a little too unprotected using Norton AntiVirus and Norton Firewall.The program seems to work against itself a little too much! First, I immediately found that it was blocking ITSELF from accessing the internet for updates or accessing files for its' own virus scanning. Then the whole process of getting updates is annoying, it doesn't seem to do it by itself. You have to login to a webpage to get updates! Plus it always needs to pop up a bunch of windows to show me it's updating. I don't think that whole production to get an update is particularly necessary.During Virus scan it asks permission to view several files. However, it finishes the virus scan before I return to my computer to click &quot;OK&quot; to access the files. Possibly the worst problem is virus scan in email. When I send large files it scans as it sends, this prolongs sending and for some reason it times out the email server and NEVER sends the message.The SpamKiller works horribly. I didn't buy it thinking I would use it anyway since no SpamKiller is really that wise, but I gave it a try. All of the messages it thought were spam were real emails and all the emails it approved as real were spam!The Spyware killer included seems a bit buggy and the Document Shredder doesn't make you FEEL that it's working. Both ran but gave a bunch of errors. Mostly I think the errors happened because McAffee was keeping it from accessing certain files.The features in the entire suite all are very confusing. I don't know where everything is and it's complicated to run. It has so much stuff and it seems that it's just thrown about in these categories. I'm not a person who usually has problems with programs. I always like and understand this stuff, but McAfee always seems to be way out in left field. I swore I never would go back to them after their &quot;Gaurd Dog&quot; program gave me problems, but I figured it's been a long time and I'd give them another chance. It's sad to see they have improved little.What do I like about this program? I LOVE THE FIREWALL. It has caught tons of IP addresses trying to gain access to my computer. This proves that my Norton firewall was not doing the job as I suspected. It has also blocked harmful popups and sneaky downloads that want to take over my computer. The Firewall in this thing is totally flawless, I have had no problem with it yet.The entire program may run flawlessly if they just made sure it didn't block itself from running its own tasks!! I will most likely end up uninstalling everything and keeping the firewall. I will have to go back to Norton AntiVirus because this is just too buggy for me."
71635,1,"The people who actually lived through it called it not WWII but ""The War"". What if The War had never ended; what if it kept going on its youth grinding path for decades, absorbing lives and destroying dreams, and, eventually, becoming an economic entity of its own? Well, that would have been an alternative world in great need of heroes.You will be fitting the well-used boots of James Anderson, an officer on the Allied side, sent deep behind enemy lines with the core objective of disrupting and disabling the Russian weapons program. Things, of course, do no go as planed. They rarely do in games with good stories.The atmosphere is bleak and grey and the level design is exceptional. The environments clearly depict a grim world where the shadow of war has set in the land and in deep the hearts of people. Shell-torn houses, muddy ditches and endless trenches are all that is left of Europe after 2 generations of endless warfare. Alternating between drab outdoor vistas, claustrophobic trenches and war-delapitaded buildings helps submerge the player in the game world, and makes him feel like he's the one creating the story.The set of weapons is excellently balanced, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. A lot of FPS games get ruined by badly designed, ineffective or overly-effective weapons. IRON STORM's weapons should be taught in game-designer seminars! Sniping is highly encouraged, however, when in close and confided spaces nothing beats a shotgun's deadly spread.Where it looses the 5th star: for starters, the controls are not remapable! I prefer using the arrow-keys (instead of the WASD-configuration), and customizing the keyboard controls to conform with my habits. However, whenever this was attempted the game...crashed - unacceptable for a game of this caliber.Moreover, the game setting just begs for a multiplayer. However, the lag is totally atrocious and renders the multiplayer practically useless.Now, this is a beautiful but in no way an easy game. There are snipers everywhere and you are all alone (frankly though, this not as bad as it sounds given that the quality of squads' AI has not improved over the years). On top of that, there is an endless number of nerve-racking German K9 units, tough enemy infantry, hidden bunkers, elite gunmen and ever-changing objectives from headquarters: all will stand in your way to victory. Bravery is rewarded - but, sometimes, a full frontal attack will only make sure you will be reloading again and again. Sneaking your way through heavily guarded areas is, in many instances, the only way to stay alive and fight another day...All in all, although not perfect, it does come close. This is a serious FPS game for serious gamers.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"
36545,1,"I tried this software for my 1st grader. I would say that some of the activities are above her level but playing this one is fun. Early geometry, sorting, accounting and much more. My friend saw it and is planning to buy one for his kids. Recommend this one to anyone who wants math challenge for the kids."
75663,1,I bought this for my kindergartener. Now that we have figured it out (I found the onscreen guide easier to understand than the booklet that comes with the game)he really likes it. He does need an adult nearby to read things such as pop-up hints to him. He also was scared by the eerie sound effects but they can be turned off. He is still at the easy level and I limited him to just one character to play. The game is pretty slow on our aging Pentium 166 and it takes a while to move from place to place in the park.

18991,1,"Hi, I'm StoryMaker. I've long been a fan of Knowledge Adventure's JumpStart products, and JumpStart Artist is no exception. In fact, it may just be the best JumpStart out there! It teaches basically anything a kid might need to know about art using JumpStart's signature games, songs, characters and reward system.Enter Kisha Koala's art fair - an interactive, fun place where kids can be creative to their heart's content. There's only one problem - Kisha couldn't manage to complete her rides. In order to earn pieces to create the Texture Merry-Go-Round, Collage Fun-house, Line Roller Coaster, and Painting Ferris Wheel (OK, maybe that's not what it was called, but memory fails me), you must play 5 interactive games that teach all sorts of things about art. Eleanor Elephant's game will teach about creativity and art styles using a painting game filled with tons of fun features and tools, CJ Frog's game will teach about art from around the world using a simple but fun and creative adventure game, Frankie's game boosts creativity by letting you paint pictures that really animate for a movie, Casey Cat's game teaches about famous masterpieces and different aspects of art using a creative new way to do concentration, and Hopsalot's game lets you learn following directions for creating artwork.Yes, there's a lot available in this one program. Better yet, all of this learning about art is fun and the songs are superb. By building the rides, you are rewarded with a fun music video that teaches about art. I love the tune to the texture song, and it's hard not to learn something from listening to these. My only slight quibble is that the collage one is rather weird...it says you can put ""poodles and people"" on collages. I suppose they probably mean pictures of them, but it was a little unclear. Plus, it shows Pierre Polar Bear (he doesn't have his own game in this product but makes numerous cameos) glued to the ceiling of a fun-house...huh?? However, the song is still (or maybe because of such) very funny.Overall, this extremely fun game not only entertains to the max but teaches as well. So much about art is taught very, very painlessly, and it gives kids a chance to be creative. A winner for kids ages 4-8! Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"" P.S. I recommend other JumpStart products, such asJumpStart Explorersand their grade-based products."
52944,0,"If you have the correct version, Checksoft works well. I've been using it for years to print checks from Quicken in one pass. However when I upgraded to Quicken 2010, my old version of Checksoft wasn't compatible. Avanquest tech support told me I needed to buy the latest version. I went to an office supply store and purchased a new copy. NOWHERE on the box does it state which version it is! But it does say it will work with current and previous versions of Quicken, and to check with Avanquest for updates when newer versions of Quicken are released. They also have a 30 day money back guarantee. Here's the catch! After much emailing and finally telephone calls, I discovered that: The money back guarantee requires that you pay to ship the product back to Avanquest, and they will reimburse the purchase price, but not any sales taxes collected! 2. If they do agree that you are entitled to a ""Free"" update, you still need to pay $7.95 for shipping!Apparently you can't download an update, perhaps because most of what comes on the DVD is Clip-art! If you need this software, buy it directly from (gag) Avanquest. You will need to search their site for the cheaper Personal Deluxe Edition, as the only direct link is to the more expensive Home and Business version!Avanquest needs to put the version information on the OUTSIDE of the box! They also need to be clear about what an update will cost. I doubt I will ever buy any more software from Avanquest."

68307,1,Purchased this because I have a 6 year old who loves puzzles. He needed about 10 minutes of guided use to learn how to navigate and from there he has spent hours with this game and goes back to it almost everyday. The training camp is fun and challenging while the laboratory is funny and fun. The teenagers in the house have enjoyed this but not as much as I have or the 6 year old.

After all it was the industry standard, but after it let many a virus slip on through; I had enough.I knew I would not get McAfee as I have repaired many computers with Mcaffee in the past (working in the computer field.)So I checked all the ratings and saw that Trend Micro and Kaspersky did the best in all of the ratings. I dediced to go with Trend Micro since their software edged out Kaspersky.Well two years later I have not looked back. I got a Trojan recently, but I called the free tech support at Trend Micro (they are the only antivirus company that offers that)- and they bailed me out. They were very helpful, spent a lot of time with me, etc. After following a few quick instructions I was back in business and my computer was clean as a whistle.When I had Norton, I would have to email them or be charged $40 for a phone call after their software let a virus in. Talk about nerve. No more, Trend Micro is head and shoulders above the rest!"
14946,1,"This program had worked well for me on Windows 2000. I never tried it on XP, having read about other users' trials and tribulations. But, I have a new Windows 7 machine and I decided to give it a try. It works just the same as on Win2K. As others say, it's rather juvenile in its user interface - to the point you'd only want to use it in private if you're over seven.

86358,1,"I have MA in linguistics and intercultural communication and I went through many programs and sources during my studying other languages (Russian,German and English and Italian) that now I can state with full right : Learning foreign language is 80% faster when you learn it with your ears. There is no other source like this one! When I opened the software on my computer and started to click on options, I couldn'tbelieve the choices you get there. You have so many of them to learn authentic french (offered to you in three level choice!), each of them is like served on the plate for you, just open your mouth.It is designed very entertaining and you don't get tired and exhausted, like in many other sources, after you listen to the dialogue you have to take a book and read on your own and read examples (which pronunciation is not guided for you), not here: Christian explains grammar as it is met in the offered dialogue, reads other examples with these structure usage! while he voices over with extremely correct pronunciation (like no other source!). You have options either listen to him in french and repeat, or if it is comfortable for you to have translation at the same time, he actually translates it and then gives french equivalent for you. Your memory for correct reproduction of foreign language increases this way amazingly! When I would tutor my students, my main method was to make them translate into foreign language form their own on the fly or in written form. Works wonderful as they would improve their skills in no time, they were even surprised without putting that much effort as you have to put for traditional learning.You have to have it if you are serious about the language, all 3 levels in onepackage, it is amazing!"

16023,1,"I use both a Palm and a Pocket PC for different applications and the Mapopolis Pocket PC Navigator solution here is outstanding. The ability to route across country, street to street seamlessly is a plus, allowing multiple 'route through' points and showing whatevetr level of detail you require. It provides turn by turn spoken and visual commands and if you go the wrong way it recalculates your route from where you are - no stopping to fiddle with the PDA. I particularly like three of the features; firstly it allows you to scroll or drag the map across the screen - you can see the WHOLE of the USA and by simply sliding your stylus across the screen , a new portion of map appears, regardless of the zoom level - great for checking out what's on the way to your destination. Secondly, it allows multiple options for avoiding Toll Roads and Freeways which is great if you're not planning on sitting in 5 o'clock traffic. Finally, I guess my favorite, is the ability to add your own favorite locations - called Geomarks - such as customers, friends, Fedex buildings or whatever, and then route to, through or from these places - it saves retyping your addresses over and over again! I love it, I hope you do too - thoroughly recommended"

15380,1,"I have owned this product for serveral years now. I recommend it very highly. It's one of those rare products that is as good as they say (perhaps even better).What it does:- pitch generation (like an electronic pitch pipe);- pitch detection (even from voices or in noisy environments);--- this is useful in tuning a guitar or in checking vocal pitch when singing;- chord display (multiple simultaneous notes);- adjustable A frequency (tuning is usually based on A=440 hertz but not always);- displays the note letter (C, B, A#, etc);- displays the 'percentage of error' (difference from the nearest pitch);- displays the exact frequency;- has a pause button so you can freeze the display and examine it closely;- displays a green indicator line and a green dot where the pitch is;- displays a yellow circle around the green dot if the pitch is within 25% +/-;- displayes a bar on the side that shows whether you are over or under the nearest pitch;- displays a pink spot in the center that shows the clarity or the timber of the tone. For singers this shows if your vocal tone is clear or fuzzy and how clear or fuzzy.PhoneTuner is very fast, very accurate, and very cool (if you are into singing and you need some help).You may be wondering what's up with the spiral display. it turns out this is a very logical display, though it takes some time to get used to it. The reason for the spiral is that as you go up the scale, the distance between each note increases. The spiral is a very natural way to display this.I got it because I had recently joined a barbershop chorus and I needed something to help me train my ear. This was the perfect tool and it worked with my Pocket PC.My only complaint is that they have not updated the product since December of 2003. The current version is 2.2.2 and is only available for Pocket PC. It would be really great if the maker would create a version for the iPhone.You can download and install it and it will work in Trial mode which only works for 60 seconds at a time. This is enough to see if it works and to test it's value. Honestly, this is a huge bargain. You'll see if you try it. It's so good that I may buy a new Pocket PC just to run it since my ailing old PPC is dying. But I would rather get an iPhone version if at all possible.You can learn more here:[...]Enjoy!"

52104,0,"I remember being blown away with how great some of the first Systemworks programs were. They cleaned up the computer, protected from viruses, everything you needed. Systemworks 2006 seems to do an adequate job, but at the price of dogging your system down unbelievably. Full virus scans take a long time no matter what program you use, but SW2006 has been taking well over two hours every time. As for its spyware protection, it has yet to detect anything on my hard-drive, but Ad-Aware (free download) always picks up about 10-20 immediately after the Norton Scan. The worst feature is the System Doctor which is supposed to constantly monitor your computer for problems which might slow down or crash your system. Ironically, what System Doctor does best is slow down and crash your system. Immediately after installing SW2006, just disable System Doctor. You'll be much happier.On the plus side, however, the utilities, anti-virus, and live update are usually pretty good. The ""One button checkup"" [which now takes 3 clicks to use :)] gives a good once over of your system and does seem to fix things that are wrong. Live Update does a good job of keeping your software current, and updates and improvements come around several times a week. Besides all that, you really can't beat the price for all the programs you're getting, even if you'll wind up disabling or not using several of them. I hope some of the size and speed issues are adressed in Systemworks 2007, but until then, 2006 seems to be working just fine.***Additional comments Dec. 20- Too bad I can't change the star rating to one. I've owned this for a while now, and more and more problems are cropping up. One Button Check-up freezes my system now, Tech support is slow and not very helpful, and Systemworks has become even slower if you can imagine it. This product doesn't do what it claims."
83409,1,"I have 2 kids ages 6 &amp; 3. Both of them can work with this program independently. My 6 year old son loves to create scenes using the animated characters with music. Then he saves the scenes, pulls them up later, and adds color to them. My 3 year old daughter just loves to color in the spaces with the different coloring utensils. She can change the utensils by herself. My son has figured out parts of it that I haven't even done yet. Get it with the Sketch Board so the kids can use it like a drawing tablet and it is tons of fun! The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I can't figure out how to work some of it. Then again, I don't spend as much time with it as my son."
58307,1,"Well, here we go. Secrets Can Kill is the start of an extraordinary series of Nancy Drew games made by Her Interactive teamed up with Dreamcatcher. This wonderful game has great graphics, a challenging mystery, and difficult yet solvable puzzles. Many people who do not play many PC games will be delightfully surprised.The game starts out with an introduction of Nancy writing a letter to her father (I find the voices of the characters very intriguing to listen to). Nancy is visiting her Aunt Eloise, but they find out a murder has been committed at Paseo Del Mar High School. Of course, Nancy is asked to solve the case.The original music and captivating sound effects keep you glued to the computer screen the whole time you're playing the game. This game will really surprise you. You'll be motivated to get every other game in the series after you play this one. Secrets Can Kill is wonderfully challenging, yet easy enough for younger players to solve all the puzzles, figure out what comes next in the game, and then finally crack the mystery.In my first couple of hours playing the game, I had to explore Aunt Eloise's house, figure out the combination to a safe, solve a flower slider puzzle, and poke through a diner.What I found intriguing in the game was that there were lots of little clues scattered about, and you really have to be a good detective and search to find them. Most of the items and clues you pick up are meant to help you beat the game, but always be on the look-out for 'hidden' things that help you to come to the conclusion that so-and-so is innocent, or there could be something that you find in a book or laying on the ground that makes one of the suspects seem very suspicious...are they the suspect, or someone else? You never can tell unless you have good sleuthing skills!Whatever the case, each suspect has some secret to hide, and it's your job to find out these secrets and the real murderer. I recommend this game. You will not waste your money or regret getting the game!"
62658,1,"After having a false start with Flex 1.0 and Flex 1.5, Flex 2.0 finally is the first proper version of Flex that works solidly. Not only has the Flex team learned from the problems, they have improved the usability with Flex Builder running in Eclipse that we are upgrading all of our Flash Web Applications to Flex with our next version releases. With Flex 3 coming soon, Flex is a technology worth investing in if you want to provide interactive and rapid developed web application. All the competing technologies are experiencing their 'Flex 1 release' and Adobe is about to be two versions ahead of them. Think Web 2.0 and you will want to use Flex 2.0."
27514,1,"I've played all the Nancy Drew games and like this one the best. You see, Nancy has to help find her friend Maya who has been kidnapped. The other characters in the game are good. This game is great because it is a little bit different from the other ones. The start of the game has you watch a kind of movie that tells you what the story is and you realize what the mystery is and that is very excited. My mom didn't play the game but she thought it was really good when I had her look at things or needed help."

The Surething product is easy to use and the results are beautiful. The output from even a...inkjet printer, when coupled with the glossy labels, is stunning."
18281,1,"I've used this product for Spanish through Level III, Russian and now French. I also study Spanish with a private tutor, and I can't say I speak perfectly - I still had a lot to learn and still do - but she says that I speak ""differently"" than her other students. She thought maybe I'd grown up around the language, but had never been formally taught. And I'd been learning Spanish for less than a year.If you use this product, I urge you to use it consistently, but don't force it. If a meaning or a phrase isn't clear, don't worry about. Study as passively as possible, as that is how you learned your first language. I would say don't even try to speak it for a few months. Just keep listening to the sounds. Let them settle in your brain.So some critics say that there's no explanatin of grammar. Well, that's good. You don't want to distract yourself with that. By the age of four, most children understand a lot more than what they can say, without studying grammar. They make mistakes, they mispronounce words, but they still have the language template. That's what you want to start with. It only comes from daily, passive immersion. Study the grammar later."
35429,0,"This game is cool, but it is way too short. This was the first time I bought a game without reading reviews first. This was not really worth the money because it was to short, but this is one of those games that you can play a couple times after you bet it and you wont get too bored."

I reported the bug to them but there is no update yet.The scroll bar is much slower now. The bar moves very slowly for 2-3 seconds before you can scroll up or down. Try it in the portfolio view in the investment center. You'll know what I'm referring to.Ofcourse the home inventory is not updated again and still is using the old DOS version.No undoPositives:Graphs look great, improved interface, newer investment transactions display, excellent reports and graphs section (same as 2003), excellent budget program, tons of institutions to link to, less advertising than before, easy online set-up, and now you can chat online with live tech support."
67286,0,"The product comes with very little technical information in regards to the installation on both the computer and device (in my case SD card). When I finally got the product installed on my Treo, and talking to the GPS reciever the product worked as well as I expected it would. I have formatted my SD card twice, and reinstall the software twice. For some reason the phone, device, and receiver lost communications. I'm disappointed in the fact that I cannot save and up load my favorites through my computer (which is a Mac). Also I am very disappointed with the limited number of favorite destinations that can be saved. I will not be buying Navigator 6 for my fellow associates."
2382,1,"I teach presentation skills, so I'm always on the lookout for things that make PowerPoint better. I've tried and recommended other software in the past, but none of them have the power of Ovation.This is an outstanding piece of software. The visual effects are stunning, and it's so easy to use that a child could learn it in a few minutes. PowerPoint is boring, and everyone's presentations look the same. Not any more! Full-motion backgrounds and effects really jazz up your presentations, and they have over 100 professional-looking business themes available. See their website (seriousmagic dot com) for a demonstration of what it can do. All you have to do is drag and drop your PowerPoint presentation on the Ovation icon, choose a theme and the effects, and voila! - a new presentation!The current version 1.0 can not process embedded video or audio files, but they say that will be fixed with the first patch within the next month or two. Despite that shortcoming, this is the best PowerPoint enhancement available - heads and shoulders above the competitors."
61592,1,"If you're looking for software that will just type what you say the moment you install it, you are going to be disappointed with ALL voice recognition software. Training a computer to understand you takes time, it is like learning a foreign language. IListen is WAY better than the other VR programs out there, much better organized, seamless, I'd say. I got this program working much quicker than Dragon. There's a misconception that this sort of program is just going to work out of the box. It's not like that, it's more of a power-user program. Stick with it, it DOES work."
9818,0,"This movie is a great adaptation of the original video game. The action sequences were amazing and the special effects were great. The underlying plot line is that several of Earth's greatest warriors are recruited to compete in a tournament that will decide the fate of their souls and of us all - if an individual looses then their soul is forfeit to the evil wizard Shang Tsung. If one of Earth's combatants doesn't win the tournament then a God-like dictator from another dimension gets to take over the planet. All of the major characters from the original game make an appearance along with reproductions of the original fight locations.As far as movies go, this one pretty much follows the classical Hollywood cinema style where Dorthy leaves Kansis, things get out of control in Oz and then things go back to normal in the end - although there is a bit of a twist at the end."
2818,1,This version does everything I need and is what I have come to expect from Quicken. I have used Quicken for almost 10 years and have always been satisfied with their products. The only thing negative is the upgrades from year to year are not always worth the money so I only upgrade to a new version when I need to because the version I am using is no longer supported by Quicken (like my old 2003 version).
26399,0,"I will keep it short and sweet and help you decide it. Before buying, go to Symantec's website and get a 15-day trial. If it doesn't crash your system or the anti-virus is still stable, chances are it will work for you.However, it didn't work for me: I am trying to run a Live Update and it tells me that I have another Live Update running, even after restarting day after day after day. It broke down forme on Day 2 and because I couldn't perform a live update, this program was worthless to me.Bottom Line: It's a shame that a so-called leader in anti-virus protection cannot develop a program that will be stable on most PCs. Either it will work for you or it won't: It's a crapshoot. If you are feeling lucky, get it or better yet, download their trial first."
6316,0,"Frankly, I was disappointed by Office 2004 for the Mac. I purchased it as an upgrade from Office X. While it did add a few new features, most really weren't of significant interest to me. What I wanted was for Excel's Pivot Table features to match those of the Windows version -- they didn't. Then, to top it off, Word's revision tracking features were changed in such a manner as to make them far less useful and a lot more intrusive (and I have to use Word for all my work as an author and editor). Entourage was significantly improved from previous versions. I won't speak to PowerPoint as that is a part of the product I don't use. While other applications can read or write Office files, none do so with the fidelity or the full feature set of the ""real Office."" So, if real compatibility is what you need, this is the best game in town."
33775,1,"I just used this product to make a video yesterday. While it took me the better part of the day to develop, the software is great. Once you get in and start using it, it's super user friendly. Great help manuals, etc. I highly recommend using this. I've tried other products for cd creation &amp; movies but this is by far the best one so far. Easy for people just starting out and also great for the more experienced user."
82516,1,"I don't know about 2003, but 2004 is great. All of the features of other mapping software plus the GPS, the ability to send maps via email, the ability to print maps, the ability to load the entire data disk onto your hard drive so your cd drive is free and the map access is much faster. You don't need the internet for any of the normal features so it works on the road. It also has audio commands for directions. It even has voice recognition but I have not tried to use it. Some people get hung up on GPS accuracy but my experience has been that all civilian systems are not that accurate on every street, on every block of every city in the entire country. This is a great value for $130.00."

And also let me recommend to the previous poster getting another degree, maybe from an accredited University."
80496,1,"Sure, if you want Windows then why are you looking at this? If you want to try something new and works great then this will replace Windows just fine. It comes with hundreds of dollars in software. You would spend that amount easily on the Windows side of things.Oh and as far as modems go... I've used it for years with modems, ISDN and now cable modems. Just don't buy junk and you'll be fine.Finally, RedHat isn't pulling it from the market. Thats the fun half truths we regularly get from Redmond. The product is alive and well. We simply have to read about what they are doing at www.redhat.com. Fedora is the next release of RedHat Linux. Remember that these release versions are stable though they have been pushing people to use the WS or ES versions of RedHat. You want a version like this then it will work just fine. The WS and ES versions however are built from this.

But otherwise, it's pretty much okay."

90620,0,"I am a very critical reviewer (see other reviews). I think this is an excellent update to 2003 Office. I like the ribbons...very much. I find the organization now far more intuitive than before.I think a lot of negatives come from people that work 10 hours a day with a dated interface. I do not. I remember the same comments when Word came out at Wordperfect people had to change to Word. Vista will have similar concerns.CONS:A major problem for me is that they did absolutely nothing to improve media (video) handling in this version, particularly for Powerpoint. It is archaic and inexcusably stupid.This is really a cosmetic overhaul with new file formats...which you cannot really use well until everyone accepts them."
73484,1,"If you have your heart set on learning a language while sitting at the computer, then this is the best computer based language learning program there is. The competition in this genre is terrible. Rosetta Stone software is stable and usable. And it is the only program I've seen with a user interface that doesn't look like a children's book.Having said that, I wouldn't recommend that anyone who is serious about learning a language use a computer program as a primary tool. Sure, you need a computer to load up your mp3 player and write to your foreign language speaking pen pal. But it takes some really serious determination to sit your butt in a chair, night after night for hours learning Spanish. Don't set yourself up for failure.Unless you are a very exceptional learner, you're going to have to practice for at least a half-hour every day. For me, that means fitting it into my lifestyle. I study while I'm driving, washing dishes, waiting in line, whenever. And I've been doing it for years. If I had to sit in front of a computer, it wouldn't have lasted a week.If you still really want computer based language training, this is the best I've seen. I believe they've added a third level to the Spanish program which should make it more complete. The boxed edition is very pricey, but Rosetta Stone has an online version for which you can pay monthly. They also have sample lessons on the website.I would recommend starting with an mp3 player and a good comprehensive audio course (Pimsleur or Platiquemos). Forget the computer programs, or use them as a supplement."
67120,1,"I bought another program (Neato) and spent a frustrating 2 hours trying to create one label. Found Surething on the net and used the free trial version.

No more majic marker for my labels! Wish this program cost less, but sometimes, you get what you pay for, and this is worth it."

You can keep dreaming, because after contacting Apple, I didn't get the impression that these features will EVER work on a PowerPc. There are many advertised features that simply do not exist on my iMac because it's not an Intel based system. However, what DOES work is pretty darn nice.

12278,1,"I ama computer builder and owner of 16 computers. I own every single Windows operating system except Windows 3.1. Windows XP is the most stable operating sytem there is. The only thing that comes close is Windows 2000 Pro, but it has many compatiblity issues. Windows XP boots extremely fast, about twice that of Win 2000 and leaves 95,98,Me behind. The only issue that you must BE VERY CAREFULL about is memory. The minimum requirements are very low, but remember that they are minimum and therefore if you are vry close to the minimum requirements it is going to run slow. I would say that to use this product properly you need at least 256MB RAM (go to crucial.com to get they have the best prices) and 512MB to really enjoy games and online stuff. As for the people who said that the default color scheme can not be changed it can be changed to over 500 diffrent combonations with any custom color you want. And if you buy a new hard drive you WOULD need to install it again because the old harddrive had your Operating Sytem on it (Windows XP\ME\98|95|2000). If you want to add a second drive you have too keep the first one in, then put the second drive in as a primary slave and format it. Also Linux Redhat or the multitude of free versions are not a wise choice to make because there is very limited software for them and any software you have for your windows PC wont work. You should also be warned that a new Windows Operatin System is coming out sometime between OCtober and December 2003 code named Windows Longhorn. You might want to wait for that, but then you might not because win XP is a very good OS."
18451,0,"I've been a user of Dramatica since earlier versions. And while I find Dramatica has some good points, I find that there are some parts of this application that are just clunky. Number 1. The character creation screens and data is just terrible. For an application of this price I would expect a little more thorough approach. I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done. In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait? Its not easy let me tell you! When trying to chose an icon to represent my protagonist I had a choice between X-Men and small cheap looking pictures of ugly cartoons. Come on now.On to the software, I like the storyforming tools. But really the terminology at points is obscure. When it says my main character's ""thematic opposite to the area of John's greatest sensitivity concerns willingness to reevaluate"" it would be nice if I didn't have to refer to the manual to figure out what that means. I'm not a dummy, but I would like to be able to use the software without having to refer to the HELP.Overall, I LIKE Dramatica Pro. But its by no means an easy App to work with. Some parts seem to be deliberately obscure, and its thin on character creation and rather heavy on your wallet."

With that lone issue set aside, this bible has greater utility than the $200+ software package that I purchased to go with my Mac. There are 14 Bibles including Catholic bibles with the Apocryphal books. Not only that, there are commentaries from luminaries like William Barclay that cost plenty to purchase elsewhere. It will be an amazing collection to your library... Unfortunately for me, this is not published in Mac format."

6596,1,"The average person doesn't usually have the cash on hand to hire an estate attorney at $300+ an hour to put together a will or living will for them. The average person with kids is even less able to afford it but the irony is that they need it the most in order to assure their kids are taken care of and that involves additional intricacies related to trusts, guardianship of the kids and such which makes the whole thing cost even MORE.Now that my custody arrangement has gotten sticky, I'm remarried and have something in the way of assets, I decided to spend a few bucks on my will. Key to that notion is 'a few bucks'. I still didn't have thousands to spend. So, I bought a copy of nolo's Willmaker Plus.If you're like me, when approaching the topic of wills, legalities, living wills and trusts, your gaze kinda glazes over and you realize that it is all very big and very complex and far too big or complex to 'get' without a law degree. This software makes it a no-brainer.It asks you questions and you either fill in information (like someone's name) or answer yes/no to very clear, easy to understand questions. Where free form text is allowed, you get very clear instructions and examples. It also adjusts the questions and forms depending upon what state you live in and what options you selected on previous questions.Most importantly, you don't just go through this experience blindly. It guides you through each step with detailed background information and explanations and offers reference material on each item beyond even what's offered in the instructions. At the end of the process, you know what you filled out and why.At the end of each form, it automatically saves it to a saved library of forms that you have filled out for quick access later and gives you the option to preview, modify or print. The printed copies come complete with signing instructions and notary and/or witness fields.Having all of the contact information for everyone together before hand and a general idea of what needed to go to who, it took me about an hour to create a will (complete with a UTMA), a living will, a temporary guardianship letter for my son and his step dad, a final arrangements declaration and automatically generated letters to my executor and elected health care agent.It is exactly what I needed. It's quick. It's in plain English. It's easy. It's cheap for what you get, which is essentially hours of an attorney's time for a fairly cut and dry task and peace of mind that everything is taken care of."
6609,1,"I have not yet looked at all the documents included in this software. I appreciate the tutorial nature and the pro/con examples given. Since I am not a lawyer, I am a bit nervous about making legal decisions that would need a test in court to be sure I made the correct choices. I did complete the HealthCare Directive and it compares well with others I've seen used in my state. I need to learn more about estate planning and this is going to teach me the jargon and the proper questions to ask.My only complaint is that I declined the free delivery option and paid for delivery so I would have enough time to work with it before my parents appointment with their estate attorney. It did not arrive in a timely manner and I was forced to purchase a download version from another vendor in order to complete forms I wanted the attorney to look at. It is no surprize that he was more interested in drawing up his own forms for my parents and charging $1000 for a basic package.I decided to keep the CD anyway (when it finally arrived) just in case I have a hard drive failure."

75605,1,"As parents of three we have run through enough educational software to fill a room in our house. But these learning adventures of Stuart Little are definitely the best thing we or our children have ever seen. The games teach, the motivational structure works (we eventually had to set a time limit), the graphics are spectacular, and the music is the great -- children's songs from around the world. There is even a copy of a state curriculum for the age groups where you can scroll along and jump directly into any game or activiey by selecting the topic you want to cover -- a kind of reverse look up. We also noticed that the children's software review (also posted on this site) contains some misinformation -- we noticed that children are not aways forced to go through long instructions or videos, although they are exposed to the instructions the first time only. Also, after a few trips they can click out of the videos too, but our children seldom do so. If you are used to the typical kind of educational software we have all been buying, then you will have to see this one to believe it!"

I can break out that part of the video and have no problem in writing that to a DVD file. But if I put the same clip in a project that uses several clips, it freezes. I am a professional computer troubleshooter and am very disappointed in this."

And one of the creatures always looks angry so my six-year old spent a lot of time trying to make it happy and she couldn't. Other than that, the controls are pretty easy, and my kids liked it for a bit. But I wouldn't buy it again."
55463,0,"Unlike several of the other reviewers, I've been a happy user of ReadIRIS for several years. I'm a graduate student, so there are lots of times when I need to pull text out of pdfs from older journal articles. ReadIRIS wasn't perfect, but compared to the time it would take to do the same thing by hand, it was worth it. So when a new version was announced for Leopard, I decided to get a copy.That will be the last copy I'll buy. The software appears to work fine, but the publisher has decided to treat paying customers like criminals. When you install the software it asks you to enter a serial number. Fair enough. However after entering the serial number you have to either call the publisher (during business hours of course) or go online and register to get a 'key'. The key is linked to the the machine you install it on. But don't get too comfortable - you can't write this down in case you need to reinstall or buy a new computer. If you do either, you're going to have to get a new key. Seems like a way to force personal information out of you so that you can support their marketing department.Given that, I'll wait until another company releases something. In the mean time, be ready to set up a new filter on your email program to get rid of their spam."
56895,1,"This review is about the HueyPro MEU113, shipped from an Amazon Merchant.When I first received the product and installed it, as the instructions said, it crashed. I called tech support and they had no advice, except to try it on another PC. I found out, later, that my Windows 7 User Profile was corrupted, and there was no documented way to fix it besides creating a fresh user profile.Remarkably that worked for me, and I was able to calibrate my monitor after booting to the new user profile.I noticed, however, that I was getting a green tint on my monitor, after calibration. That, and I was unable to follow the instructions on getting the white and black rings to appear as one (the brightness/contrast issue that a lot of people have). I have an el-cheapo monitor, which may be of lesser quality. So instead of returning the device, I simply turned down the green on my monitor and recalibrated. That seemed to do the trick.Also, I noticed that from certain angles, the color tint is different, and my monitor doesn't really hold the tint very well. So even after you've calibrated, you can run into a situation where your monitor is not tilted at the right angle, or needs to be recalibrated, and it will definitely show a tint on LCD monitors of lesser quality.So that sort of might explain why some people are getting a bad tint, and to adjust your monitor if you do, because you *can* get good color after you adjust it some. But I can understand, too, how some units just might be defective.I'm giving it 4 stars because it's good that it actually works ""well enough"" to get to this level of color calibration. However, I'd recommend something more pricey for professionals who need ""great"" calibration."

50469,1,"Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed the PC game? Well, I remember playing it when i was about 7 or 8. I had so much fun. It was all I ever wanted to do. Play this game. Well, I lost this gmae, and years down the road, I remember the name of the game and such. I look everywhere and can't find it. Well, I hear about Amazon, so I check on here. BAM!! There it is. So, I buy it and wait a few days. When it gets here, the package opens with ease, i install the game. I began to brace myself for complete disappointment, for I thought I had built the game up way to much in my mind. But, as it turns out, whish this you will NEVER believe, the game was SO much more fun than it used to be. I would recommend this gamn for ALL ages! :)"

76908,1,Could not be simpler. Plug the SD card in and it works! Shipping was fast. Garmin advised me that new maps were coming out next month (should be out by the time you're reading this) but these are very current.....at least for Raleigh and NC.I have a Tomtom Rider and tried to get maps for Europe before we left on vacation. After 3 weeks I still did not have my maps so we bought the Garmin Nuvi in Rome. It's awesome! Ordered these North American maps when we got home and got them in two days.

27496,0,"I was disappointed with this game. I enjoyed playing it, but I thought that the ending was way too predictable. I knew about ten to fifteen minutes into the game who the kidnapper was. The whole game wasn't easy. Some of the puzzles and things were really hard. As a matter of fact, if I hadn't gotten some help on a couple of things, I may not have been able to get to the ending. I was just very annoyed by the fact that I had to go through all this hard stuff just to be told something that I had known all along. Also, there was something in the story that went unexplained, unless there was an explanation and I just missed it. I can't elaborate on that part any further because I don't want to spoil the ending for those who won't find it that predictable."
28927,1,"My music instructor suggested this cd rom for intro to music, from my oppinion,I think it is the best thing any student can use while in school.

I didn't give it a 5 star simply because it wasn't as easy to negotiate as I would have liked....I purchased 2 4.0 books, The Missing Manual 4.0 (really helpful) and Teach Yourself Visually 4.0 (slightly helpful)...very good software after you learn your way around."
89327,1,We bought this for my 5 year old for Christmas. To our surprise our 9 year old spent an hour playing the other day only to be followed by our 12 year old.

91509,1,Final Draft has created the perfect word processor for constructing scripts. The interface is clean and straightforward. To the beginner it can be used quite effectively after the brief tutorial; for the expert it offers unlimited customization.Quibbles? None really except that you have to 'authorize' the program to use it without having the CD in the drive. Therefore if you write on two computers you will either have to have two copies of Final Draft or put up with having to insert the program CD into the drive of the unauthorized computer.All in all Final Draft 6.0 is an excellent program and well worth the money.
36729,2,"Easy Language 61 is an okay program -- when it works! I'd only used it briefly a couple of times at first, and it worked fine. It's a very simple interface [sometimes to the point of being a little confusing], and it helps you learn a few words and phrases by displaying pictures of items with the word in both your language and the word in your target language; you can hear the word spoken in your target language by clicking on the picture. Since in my case I was trying to learn Greek, I could toggle between the word written in Greek, and the word written phoenetically with a 'normal' alphabet.Well.. later I sat down to do some serious learning, and I found that although I could still see the word written phoenetically, the word in Greek was inexplicably replaced by a bunch of &quot;? &quot;. I tried restarting the program and my computer several times, but the Greek seemed to be gone for good.One of the selling points of the program was a nifty-sounding feature that will allow you to record your voice and compare it graphically with a native speaker. Well.. it's not as nifty as it sounds, as it turns out. The graph has no identifyers or explanations whatsoever, and is just a very simple sound-wave graph. There isn't even any explanation of or reference to this feature in the 19-page &quot;User's Manual&quot; [actually just a jewel case insert booklet that contains very little useful information]. Their customer support URL is listed in the User's Manual, but after visiting the URL the only thing I found was a mailing address for the company and a 1.800 number. I loathe talking on the phone, so the lack of online customer support was pretty disappointing. Also, inside the software box was an insert stating that Navajo was not available on my version of the program, but that I could visit a URL and recieve further information on how to receive &quot;both&quot; languages. Well, as it turns out, it's the very same URL as the &quot;customer support&quot; page. So, I couldn't download a patch -- by now I was kind of expecting something like that -- but there wasn't even any instructions on the site on how to get my Navajo upgrade! Talk about bloody frustrating..To make matters worse, after about a half-hour of using the program [without my words written in Greek, but I figured I could do without that feature if I had to] the audio fritzed out and I couldn't hear the spoken word anymore. My computer then proceeded to lock up. My computer's fault, or the software's? At this point, my bet's on the software."
94708,0,"Nearly all articles are still better written than those of Encarta. Some are not up to date though.Here's my theory about the awful interface / software design that so amny people have complained about: I think the Britannica team deliberately makes year after year a bad interface in order to keep as many customers as possible to buy the $1300 print version. Since the publishing of CDROM (fall of sales of the print version) and the beginning of strong competition (encarta, etc...), they must have been very reluctant to publish their encyclopedia on CDROM at such a low price (though at the beginning, they managed to charge their cdrom at around $600 if i remember properly the price i paid at that time, around 1998).This year's interface (britannica 2005) is no exception: slow (this year it's 256mb of memory recommended...wow...) and browsing / search functions to its most basic, extremely poor indeed.And as usual the ""propedia"" of the print version is not included, which would help so much to browse and find appropriate articles.What's best to do then?Complain to them won't help (since all the years they must have been receiving so many complains by now but they don't care, this is classic corporation, money strategy first (= print version)), morals later.Therefore, I'll keep my 2002 version (or keep your 2003 / 2004) as there isn't any notable change with 2005 (only 3% of content updated I estimate)and i bought the latest encarta 2005 (and the next ones when it'll be out) as supplement, especially for update information and the good atlas.No more spending on britannica for now this until they eventually decide to develop good software.I was lucky enough to have been able to preview of the 2005 britannica version (hence the result in this review) from a collegue who've bought it without second thought (which she does regret)."

56279,1,"I have this program and Adobe Photoshop 7.0. I am not a pro who can spend countless hours figuring out how to use Adobe Photoshop. With very little time I figured out how to use Corel Paint Shop Pro X and now it is all that I use to edit my photos. For anyone who is not a professional photographer, I highly recommend Corel Paint Shop Pro, it is easy to use and gives professional results! I am very impressed with this software and what you can do with it."
80403,1,"And it is much better than doing things by hand. I went from spending hours and hours tracking my small business finances, to just a few minutes a week. It is wonderful software. There is nothing really bad I have to say about it other than there is a small learning curve. I do my payroll and quarterly tax reports all directly from within Quickbooks. All my finances are tracked and the report generation features are very powerful. If you are starting a business, or already have one, I highly recommend this software. It simplifies things tremendously."

I figured for [$$]it was worth a try.I use it OFTEN and REALLY LIKE the feature that let's you save an image for the Web. It's saved me much grief and lots of hassles.Unfortunately the help on the program stopped working and a fresh installation didn't fix the problem. Now the crop box no longer follows the cursor. (NO, I don't have a virus present.)I'm hoping that if I update the V 2.X these problems will disappear but not counting on it.I recommend this program if you want some reasonable power and ease of use."
6696,1,"I expected my kids (6 and 4) would get tired of the humungous game series of role-playing games (Pajama Sam and Freddi Fish), but they don't! It seems they could play them forever, even though the basic gameplay is the same for all of them. Humungous keeps things fresh by introducing new characters and puzzle types that keep the kids hooked. The story is engaging enough that one kid doesn't mind watching while the other plays. But don't be fooled by the packaging that alludes to the educational benefit of learning about food groups--any learning that occurs will be by accident. Also, a few of the puzzles require reading skills and left my kids calling for help. All in all, a fun game that is worth the price of admission."
5221,0,"I've read many reviews for NAV going right back to NAV 2002. The general concensus was that the product was okay without being exceptional but that Symantec has turned into an greedy, arrogant ogre that only wants your money. I'd agree entirely.NAV has protected me well for years and I keep the virus definitions regularly updated. However, last week it let me down. It couldn't remove a virus that it had let through and recommended manual removal. I followed the instructions on Symantec's web site but they didn't work. The virus kept reinfecting my computer and it took me days to figure out how to remove it properly (which I had to do by visiting McAfee's site and other rival sites). I wanted to flag this up to Symantec but (unbelievably!) they now offer no online support whatsoever! Just on an offchance, I tried sending an email to support@symantec.com. It got bounced back!! The only way to report this problem would be to pay for telephone support - but why should I pay them to report errors in their own documentation?On top of that, when your subscription runs out, it also pesters the life out of you until you finally submit and pay them more money. I won't be renewing my license again. Next time it expires, I'll buy something else!"

86421,1,"Seamless match to Nikon cameras that shoot RAW (NEF) with features normally found in more expensive packages (U-Points must be tried to be believed). Some operations like White re-balance, highlight/lowlight recovery, and exposure compensation either cannot be done or cannot be done as well once the picture is frozen in JPEG or TIFF. Capture NX works on RAW data and does a great job of letting you change the majority of in-camera settings AFTER you have taken the shot in an easy non destructive, reversible way - better than having your own dark-room. The program is an excellent complement to Photoshop, which can then be used to cut and paste people or things in or out of the picture. As an alternative to Capture NX, Adobe Camera Raw's Photoshop plug-in is a distant second choice, unable to deal with Nikon camera settings and localized changes in as easy and seamless a way: for instance, if you want that Mode III look in ACR, you are out of luck. Capture NX keeps getting better with every new release. I have started using version 1.3 on my T7200 based laptop, and do not seem to have the speed issues of earlier versions. I am looking forward to an improved Photographer-friendly skin (here ACR's more limited and therefore simpler interface has the lead: why not bring all of the contrast/brightness controls under the same view?), a more advanced, layered D-lighting feature, and easier dust spot removal - ok, I know that we are now into cut and pasting territory, but that's typically the only reason why I have to open Photoshop. Other than that, I love this program which improves pictures so quickly and easily in a single non-destructive post processing stop before printing."
33173,1,I have been using it since it came out. I have had no major problems. I stick with standard commercial applications and few games. I did use the archive and reinstall once when I messed up my vidio drivers. I have 10.1 on one of my drives and it boots up from that drive for no appearant reason about once a week. I run software update and use the Repair Disk Permissions feature of the Disk Repair Utility frequently.

60589,1,"This application makes applying for copyrights as painless as possible (the process will still be painful regardless, but at least you'll be avoiding a large portion of it).First, a correction. Despite the product page claiming that this software is made by Enteractive, it's really made by Official Software, LLC. Second, a caveat - this product allows you to do a lot of the groundwork yourself, but does not replace professional advice of an attorney (I am NOT an attorney, but certainly know better than to wade into shark infested waters without the benefit of legal advice).What the program does: It shields you from the legal mumbo jumbo and leads you through an interactive process of applying for a copyright. It does this using an interviewing process and assists with the completion of the following forms: PA, PA/S, TX, TX/S, VA, VA/S and Form SR, all of which are important and all of which can be completed interactively on your system. You also get Form CA for Corrections & Amplifications, and Form CON Continuation Sheet in the package.It also gives key information from Copyright Office ciculars to assist you when filling in the form fields, and this is why your finished forms should be checked by an attorney before submission. The value of this program is that you can save many hours of expensive attorney time by doing the up-front work, which will minimize the legal costs of preparing and submitting a copyright application. As an added bonus this program also provides advice about how to use the copyright. The publisher also has specific online forms that can be used with this package that cover everything from music to architecture.This program also covers copyrights for online works & websites, so if your copyright is in connection with e-commerce or Internet material I strongly recommend that you read CyberRegs: A Business Guide to Web Property, Privacy, and Patents by Bill Zoellick before you use the program itself. Also, if you're also interested in trademarks, you will save money by purchasing the Official Intellectual Property Suite, which bundles this program with the companion program called Official Trademark Software 1.0."

YOu will see a difference in your child after using this cd system.
50579,1,"Well, I thought I'd make the leap into digital scrapbooking using this product. It installs easily and is not too difficult to learn to use, but to tell the truth, I guess I'm more of a paper, scissors, glue type because I find it a lot more relaxing to create my layouts that way. So, I'm sure I haven't scratched the surface of what the product can do, but I am making good use of all the fonts that came with it for titles and journaling."

The XP recovery disc enabled me to get back up and running thanks to help from a friend. I then tried to re-install, omitting Direct cd which I was told was the problem, and the install hung. After getting unhung I went to the Roxio web site and downloaded a patch. The patch did about as much good as hitting my computer with a shovel. My advice - if Roxio has stock, don't buy it.

She is an aspiring writer and she constantly used word count, now Office 2007 has that built right into the status bar. It has a better GUI and frankly I think the new file types will help later on since I believe they are a psuedo web format (Makes file sharing easier). We have not had it that long, but in what little use we have had with it we are impressed.For advanced users some of the features may be hard to find, but for normal users I think Microsoft has done everyone a favor by re-doing all the navigational structure, including a better right-click menu."

The other programs are okay, but not as 'finished', maybe because just about every TV show and Film is made with Final Draft. It really is combat tested.

84422,1,"My nine year old is a soccer fanatic, so naturally we had to get him Backyard Soccer for Christmas. Little did I know that this little game could replace his real life fun during the off-season.From Humongous Entertainment, the makers of other children's classics like Junior Field Trip Collection, Freddi Fish, and the other Backyard favorites (Baseball &amp; Football) comes Backyard Soccer.This game reminds me of my younger days. The realism included is awesome!The programmers thought of everything from selecting your own team to playing for the championship.The game starts with all of the Backyard gang gathered on the bleachers for the ceremonial picking of teams. As you make your selections, you can review the strengths and weaknesses of each player. Once you have put together your &quot;Dream Team&quot;, it's off to pick your name and jerseys.Of course, you have to have somewhere to play, and yes the programmers covered this one too. You pick from a number of neighborhood fields.Now it's time for the game to start, and low and behold the commentators for the match-up appear. They even have an Englishman to do the color commentary.My nine year old loaded and taught himself all of the ins and outs of this one. He's already played a number of league seasons, and yes he has won the championship with his Humongous Rockets team! He could even print out his team picture to commemorate the occasion!The controls are so easy that even my four year old can be competitive at this one.Thank You Humongous for covering the off-season and keeping soccer alive in my house!"
28101,1,"I have recently become more serious about web page design. I looked at other products and tried them out. However, Dreamweaver has exceeded my expectations. I am not an advanced user by any means, so my rating might have a ""new user bias"" to it. My first web site used a WYSIWYG editor similar to Frontpage. Then, I downloaded the 30 day trial of Dreamweaver and redesigned the site. Productivity greatly increased and the interface is very easy to navigate, once you get used to it. The new web site is by far more impressive, user friendly, and feature rich without a cut in productivity. Learning Dreamweaver is a pleasure. If you are familiar with web design, the learning curve is very nice. I was making web pages within a couple of hours of downloading the trial. Tutorials are readily available in the Help menu and on the Adobe web site. Of course, you can always find a good book here on Amazon. If the price of Dreamweaver can fit your budget and you are serious about making impressive web sites, I highly recommend the consideration."

The program is decent, although it does not do much. PA taxes aren't that complicated to being with. One complaint is that the program dumped me into a PA Schedule C instead of asking whether I want a PA Schedule C or a PA Schedule C-F. I went to forms and created a schedule C-F, then went back to the interview, and my schedule C-F was there. This procedure would not be obvious to someone who was not already very familiar with this program.I am not sure why someone would want to pay $14.95 for the State e-filing. There is no rebate for the state filing. So when you file your taxes electronically, make sure you select Federal only, then print out your state tax return and mail it in."
93738,1,"After researching handheld GPS units, I chose to buy a Delorme PN-20, and I am very happy with it. Delorme has THE BEST customer service I have ever dealt with!!! I bought a referbished unit because I don't have a lot of money...when the unit got to my house I plugged it into my computer and the GPS froze! I was bummed. I called Delorme tech support and they took me through the steps to fix the unit. It still did not work so they sent me a new USB cable. When I recieved that I tried again, with no luck. This is the risk you take when buying refurbished electronics. By now it is almost time for my backpacking trip that I had planned to use the GPS on, and I really wanted the GPS for this trip. I told tech support this and they OVERNIGHTED me a new unit! They saved my trip! Besides the customer service, the unit comes with awesome software and maps, which you would have to buy separately if you had bought another brand of handheld GPS. If I had to do it all over again, I would deffinately not buy refurbished, but I would ABSOLUTELY buy Delorme! My next GPS is going to bethe Delorme PN-40."
74384,1,I enjoy researching various subjects simply out of intellectual curiosity and find Encarta a useful tool. I'm somewhat overwhelmed by the multimedia offerings but like the chronological updates and appreciate this treatment of current events.
61137,1,I found this upgrade has fixed some things and attempted to fix things that did not require fixing. Hot keys that go to dockers does not speed up the work process. It appears to be slower in handling bmps. Larger files cause it to hesitate selecting objects. A real memory hog. The new contour tool makes the upgrade worthy. So far it is not crashing like 12 did.

27972,1,"I love this program. It is easy to install and configure. I haven't noticed a difference in the start-up and shutdown of my machine, so if there is one, it is slight. I have had the virus protection turn off once, but it was after not restarting my computer for several days. If you're concerned about spyware and hijacking, I recommend Panda over Norton or McAfee."
51571,1,"I've been using VS.NET for about 4 months now, and everyday I get more excited about it capabilities. I'm an experienced VB5/6 programmer and VB.NET is a whole new level. The OO features are welcomed and I've been waiting for them. VB development environment has always been the key to RAD in my mind. VS.NET takes that a step further and offers many new enhancements. The VB language is now very eligant and clean with loads a capability provided by the .NET Framework. The .NET Framework simplifies many methods I used to code by hand, and the extent of the base classes are sick!I have to mention distribution also... I distributed some apps around the company on many machines without installing a single .NET component, just load the framework and you're going (unless you need a legacy COM component)."
595,1,"I was so happy with Art Explosion Greeting Card Factory Deluxe that I jumped to buy this one and was quite thrilled with all the new cards available. (Just ordered the new #2 too!) Like the other, this can be fully installed so you don't need to hunt the CD every time you want to make a card. Easy to change card sizes too. More variety of ready-mades than most of the competition (I own them too). I highly recommend Nova's products and their online support has been right there and very helpful."
79236,1,"IF YOU HAVE SUPPORTED HARDWARE AND DRIVERS, and your machine is beefy enough to run Vista then this is a great update.I've been running this since Beta 1. The final version is stable, comes with most drivers, will tell you before install if it does not support your hardware & drivers. It also has a great automatic rollback feature in case the install fails.I've installed on a 3-year old Dell laptop, no problem.I've installed on a 2-year old Dell workstation, no problem.I've installed on a new Alienware laptop, very non-standard driver requirements, only the webcam is not working.Overall it is very stable. the Aero interface looks great, and it works well with existing software, including games like World of Warcraft.I didn't give it 5 stars because I think the control panel is still more complex than it should be for typical users."
40926,0,"I switched from TurboTax a few years ago to TaxCut. Using TaxCut was a decent experience. The program itself is easy to use and negotiate. Jumping back and forth in the return was a fairly simple process. There were significant improvements over the previous year's version. Which is always a welcome thing.Last year, however, TaxCut made a few foolish choices. First, they stopped making a version for Mac users. Second, they were of no help whatsoever helping those Mac users import their data to either the Windows version of their own program or the Mac version of TurboTax. This marked the end of doing business with them for me. While they have included Mac versions this year, I won't trust them again.BE WARNED: TaxCut customer service is painfully bad."
66386,1,"I'm not going to go too much into the amazing robustness of this program. It is hands down the best wysiwyg + coding program out there. Even if you are a hand coder, it will help you be more productive. Be sure you have a lot of computer resources for it as it is still a hog, but better than previous versions.**Mainly, I just wanted y'all to know to go to Dreamweaver's site immediatley after getting this program so that you can install v6.1 updater.** I was surprised it shipped as the older version."
51230,1,"I have used many different contact management software systems in the past and Goldmine is definitely worth it's weight in gold! As an insurance agent, I have many customers who may have several different types of policies and I may send out many different types of marketing pieces based on my internal market research. Goldmine has allowed me to customize my database to gather specific information relevent to MY agency. It is not the easiest software in the world to learn but once I have invested the money in a good trainer, a world of options opened up. It's very easy to synch with Word or Excel and export client lists to labels or envelopes or form letters. It's great for running data-specific reports and has ultimately saved me thousands of man hours and money. More then worth it if you are willing to invest time and money into learning the system and all the customizable options."

Unless you want to take a chance every time when you print don't get this for cards you want to send in the US mail. They also removed the quotations option and still no way to search for graphics. Install does not tell you how to add the ""bonus"" graphics."
33539,0,"I think the product is excellent for the price I originally paid. I found a couple of outdated numbers, normally that's not a bad average but I only look up a few numbers a month. You can't export enough numbers either but then of course I'm not using it for mailing lists. It outdates itself in a year, but at that price that's not so bad, you can afford to renew. But at the price they try to sell it for directly is not very reasonable, unless you are using it to extract high volume mailing lists. All in all it's a nice product."
46931,0,"When I purchased this CD, I thought I'd be getting a great lookback at some of the WWF's greatest Raw moments. It features SteveAustin, The Rock, Undertaker, Mankind, DX, The Austin/McMahon fued, and the Corporate Ministry. While it provides a decent amount of video and sound clips, the rest of the CD seriously lacks. For example, there is a &quot;Superstar Photo Gallery&quot; that doesn't contain more than one image of each wrestler. If that isn't bad enough, there are only 15 personalities available! I know the WWF has more superstars than that. The &quot;Superstar Bios&quot; section is even worse, containing only 9 bios. The company who made this disc could have just pulled all the bios off the WWF web site and used those. Why they only chose a few is beyond me. Also included are three, yes, three &quot;screen savers&quot;. Steve Austin, Debra, and &quot;WWF Superstars&quot;. The Steve Austin screen saver only has 4 images of him! The Debra one has a few more, and the &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; saver only shows about 8 images of WWF wrestlers. Again, there are far more wrestlers in the WWF than that. I've seen better savers on the internet for free... I think the design and interface of the CD is very weak. It's just bad in some spots and confusing in others. In closing, an alright disc for the clips if you don't already have them on tape, but not much more than that. The WWF has a good track record for quality products, but I was shocked that they actually let Multimedia 2000, inc release this thing. It's VERY overpriced at $29.99. I wouldn't pay more than $9.99 for it after seeing how bare and amature looking it is. Maybe Volume 2 will be better."
30514,1,"GIT really did a fine job with these comic collections. Too bad Marvel is now going totally online and won't let anyone have the actual comics in hand anymore. *sigh* Oh, well -- but if you can get it used (or from GIT), go for it. It's definitely worth the money!"
26961,1,"I have used a variety of security and antivirus programs over the years. I never liked any of the products other than Norton because they had so many gaps in features. But Norton in recent years has become a major computer resource hog such that th computer running it becomes very slow. This recently made me consider switching to Kaspersky. I am very happy I did. If you switch from Norton installation can be tough because Norton products always leave code behind that messes with new programs and this was no exception. But after a few days I sorted this all out with technical support and I can state that all the functionality of norton is there with much less of a reduction in computer speed. I will purchase this line of products from now on instead. One thing to note though, is that although AMazon encourages you to bundle the Anti-Virus and Internet Security products this is not necessary as the Internet Security product includes the Anti-virus suite. I went with Amazon'r recommendation and had to return the Antivirus program for that reason. Overall I am very pleased."
27092,1,"I really enjoyed this one. It wasn't so difficult that I had to go on-line to the forum to get spoilers in order to figure out the riddles or problems. At the same time, it wasn't too easy so I still had to use my brain. Since I didn't have too many problems I wished it had lasted longer. I like games that last long, but not because a particular problem or riddle takes hours to solve. I highly recommend this game."

81114,1,"I used this on a recent trip to southern France. I thought it was fantastic and it completely won over my skeptical husband.We travel a lot and normally rent a car. It has often taken us many hours (and many arguments!) to find our hotel. (One time in Rome, we gave up, turned in the rental car and took a taxi to the hotel!)On this trip, the Garmin found every hotel on the first try (4 hotels). It saved us a tremendous amount of time. Not only that, but it made us more adventurous. We had no fear about wasting time gettng lost so we visited lots of attractions we may have bypassed.It was a risk because it was an expensive purchase, but it turned out to be worth every cent. I can't say it was 100% perfect, but it was darn close, so I am giving it a 5."

54476,1,"I bought this mostly for Audition, but also to update my other software as well. While this version is technically ancient by technology standards it still works well when paired with good hardware. I am doing some video projects on it now and I must say that I am highly impressed!Even though this version of Premiere it is old as dirt I am still able to edit HD material on it (granted I cannot import HD material direct from camera) through the VFW settings. But with my little Core2Duo I am able to do real-time editing for most fades and basic effects (premiere is not made for doing advanced effects and filtering anywas, best to do that in Ae, or Virturaldub/AVS which is free)Aftereffects is still klunkey, as to be expected, but it gets the job done if you are patient with it.Audition (which I bought this for) is awesome! Considering this was their first audio editing software release they did an excellent job. Just the noise reduction settings alone has saved my life on several occasions. The other built in plugins get the job done for most cleaning projects, and it supports many 3rd party filters and effects. The big downfall for this however is that I upgraded to win7, and now am unable to record audio because Microsoft changed their audio drivers too much. Still great for cleaning and editing audio for premiere though which is most of what I used it for in the first place.Encore DVD. It works, and you technically CAN do anything you want. Wanting to spend the time however is a different story. Surely their newer DVD authoring software is better.Photoshop. It is old. Would probably annoy me not to have the newer hardware support, but I think I have used it once so far, so it doesn't matter to me much.All in all if you want quality software on the cheap I highly suggest buying some of their legacy software. Everything still works in win7 with exception of recording in Audition, but rather than the multi-thousand-dollar price tag that this originally packaged as, you should be able to find it for a few hundred. Once again, if you are an AV professional and will be using this everyday then you will want something newer that supports 64bit*, 4+core, and graphics acceleration; But if you are just learning Adobe software, or just do side projects like I do then this will get you a nice looking end product with a little more rendering time.*this will still work under a 64bit OS with 64bit hardware, it just will not take advantage of any acceleration or precision that you could get with newer packages that have native support for this."

38991,1,"No idea why people are trashing SP2, since it introduces a lot of stability and security enhancements. In the latter dept. it's still not robust yet; you need a firewall (e.g., a router or ZoneAlarm software) and a free anti-virus program (AVG, from grisoft.com) to beef up your security. But in many other aspects SP2 fixes stability and security holes and it installed seamlessly on my PCs and has made things soemwhat better.This XP Pro upgrade is for people who have XP Home installed. The added advantages of XP Pro include 1) the ability to encrypt files and folders at the OS level; 2) the ability to control read/write/access rights of individual files and folders; 3) enhanced networking support; 4) dual-processor support; 5) and more. I chose XP Pro over Home for the first two reasons, as I'm paranoid about people snooping on my PC when I take a shower or dump."

79265,0,"Every time I upgrade, some features are better but many more have become over-complex. Lets face it - how many people are capable of using even a quarter of the features of Word? Who wants 150 templates? I never use them - I make my own.There seem to be some serious problems with Word. Tables in Word on the Mac are a nightmare. Its all so unpredictable and can be very slow compared to a PC. For no apparent reason (usually when I've cut'n pasted a row - or reduced the font size using keystrokes rather than the mouse)it crashes. It even took Excel with it last time.I hate the new drop-down autofill in Excel 2001. The old one was fine and quicker. Why &quot;improve&quot; something just for the sake of it? They have done something really odd to the sort function with numbering. At one time it sorted 2 after 20 ...another &quot;improvement&quot;?As for the multilevel numbering. If only they would stop changing it. I just get my head round the latest version and they change it again! The contortions one has to go through to miss out a level ....Overall I like the look of Office 2001 and some of the features are great. I even like Entourage - contrary to popular opinion.Why isn't there a decent built-in fax facility? I am having a dreadful time with Symantec - it won't open with anything I posess!In desperation I was going to try Appleworks but was put off by the reviews ...."
91868,1,My son requested this for his Birthday. He didn't want to buy a download online incase his lap top dies and he has to get another.

I had to look around awhile before I found this and was very happy to buy it. It came quickly and is exactly what he asked for.

Other than that, I did like many of the features (for example, smoothing and removal of digital noise functions and the tool to quickly process a photo were all excellent; the quick processor does a better job than on version 8). If Corel was to get the browser back the way it was, I would be a buyer."
23219,0,"I can not write a positive review of software that is upgraded because the previous version (2004) was sunseted after only 3 years. I find Quickbooks unimpressive but useful. I do not like the pervasive intrusions to buy other of the vendors ""upgrades"". I need simple accounting software. I can see that any continuing relationship with Quickbooks will be tenuous at best. My accountant wants me to convert to Peachtree but I will continue to use this software until the next sunset."
73160,1,"Yes, this release is definately a significant leap from 6.2, but still I wouldn't call it perfect (though, in contrast, I'd give win32 2 stars and MacOS 9.1 3.5). All of the mid/low level GNU utilities work just fine, infact better than their Solaris 8 counterparts (in my humble opinion). It's the UI level stuff that I still run into trouble with, although it's much better than 6.2, where X would freeze the whole system occasionally and wouldn't even let me open up another virtual console to kill the defunct processes. Utilities like Glade have croaked with the occasional segmentation fault, and X will still sometimes freeze on me (maybe It's something I could be doing wrong?), but I'm usually able to get out of it without rebooting. I'm also having trouble getting my USB zip250 drive working (this isn't a major gripe for me, since other, commercial OSes have given me similar problems here). But in spite of all that, I had no trouble getting sound to work, and I was able to get Mesa to build on my machine, and in no time I was writing little GLUT programs to try it out. I'd like to point out that I tried the deluxe edition this time around, and found that It included a cd of non-free 'Enterprise Workstation Software' (or something) which I found to be unnecessary. Given the add-ons included with the deluxe addition, I think I could have gotten by with the standard. Oh, and really the only reason that I got this distribution is that my current linux machine isn't connected to the internet currently, if it were, there'd really be no reason to pay for an upgrade, It's all avalible online, and relatively easy to install."

18850,1,"Bibleworks 7.0 is hands down the best software available for Bible Study. Customizable satellite image maps of Israel, incredible number of original language texts, lexicons and numerous resource material galore!! Also, don't listen to the review about poor customer service!! Customer service is excellent. I've had nothing but a positive experience with customer support. I also personally attended a full day of conferences where they send out representatives to help you learn how to better utilize the powerful program that you have (they have these in several locations across the country, just check out their website for more info). However, if you are not going to study the original languages, you may want to look elsewhere. Sure you could use the program and get a lot of help from it, but it really is original languages oriented. Also, Bibleworks has helped me to teach myself (with the Lord's help) Greek and Hebrew. It is well worth its price, if you spend a lot of time studying God's Word.UPDATE (2-15-2011)I upgraded to BibleWorks 8 as soon as it was available and have been using it daily. BibleWorks 7 blew me away with its ability to cut my study/research time by leaps and bounds and I couldn't even envision it getting any better other than add-on modules. BibleWorks 8 has done that! I just simply can't speak any more highly concerning this software program. Several new additions as far as resource grammars for Aramaic, Greek, and Hebrew as well as the Early Church Fathers, and a new feature that allows you to copy search results and other selections directly to Word without first going to the editor then copying it over, etc. I could go on and on about BibleWorks 8. Again, there is no product available that I would recommend any higher than this program for serious Bible study that focuses on original language studies!UPDATE (09-02-2011)Well, now I have BibleWorks 9. I will not add anything to the above reviews that I have already done and just briefly comment on how incredible the new features in BW 9 are! First off, the CNTTS (Center for New Testament Textual Studies) apparatus is incredible! You can also view high resolution photos of major Greek manuscripts because of the BibleWorks Manuscript Project, even contains overlays to show you where the verse begins and ends (a lot of New Testament manuscripts had no punctuation or chapter/verse separations, so this is a great feature that can be turned on or off), and you can even mess with the color settings and make the manuscript more readable!!! Also included are searchable companion texts to the manuscripts that are viewable in the BW Manuscripts Project! Also, in the main BW window you have three main windows, the Search window, Browse window, and Analysis window. You now in BW 9 have the ability to add a fourth window to your workspace, which can be very handy, especially after watching the tutorial videos (included in the program itself) on how this can help your studies! Also included is the New Moody Bible Atlas, complete with printable high resolution photos and maps, that really help when putting together a presentation/lecture!! BibleWorks still continues to blow me away with each upgrade!! Worth well beyond the asking price, you won't regret this purchase if you are in the market for what it can deliver!BibleWorks 9"

After calibrating with the Huey, the colors match perfectly! The setup is quick and easy.If you are at all serious about digital photography, you need to calibrate your monitor. The Pantone Huey is an inexpensive and accurate way to do just that."
8008,1,"I bought OS X Leopard the day it was released, and I can safely say it is by far the best operating system from Apple to date, and really puts Windows Vista to shame.Best features:- Quick Look- Time Machine- StacksI love the quick look feature b/c I no longer have to open document after document to see what is in them, same goes for pictures and videos. Just select a file and press space bar, and it pops up so quickly and easily, that it has shaved time off my searching for files.Stacks are also awesome, especially b/c I am constantly saving attachments from emails, and I used to clutter up my desktop with them all. Now, with stacks, I no longer have this worry, and my desktop always stays clean.With regards to installation, it took me about 1 hour, and went super smooth. This being my first MAC OS upgrade, I was shocked to see there were no error messages after my upgrade (unlike with Windows), and that all my programs and accessories still worked after the upgrade.Also, the operating system runs with no slow down, or lag at all. I would say, in some instances, if actually runs faster than OS X 10.4.With regards to the type of machine I am running on:- Macbook Intel Core Duo- 2 GB of RAM- 80 GB Hardrive"

88166,1,"After reading the reviews on installation problems, I was a little nervous about installing this software. The installation could have been smoother, but it installed alright. Although it did detect my older version (Standard V6), and advised me to uninstall the old version prior to installing the newer one; when it came to verifying if I had a qualifying product the installation program could not detect that I had V6. Now it was requiring that I type in the serial number of the older version. Because of that I spent about 4 hours looking for the older software and software case that had the serial number for V6. After typing in the serial number of V6, the software installation continued without a problem.I like this software, and it is much faster then V6, though I haven't checked out all the features. I'm still evaluating this product. One thing I like about the Pro version is the built in OCR. It's not the greatest recognition software, but if your scanned document has standard type it does a good job converting. It does not perform well if the document contains fancy fonts; especially script fonts."

27118,1,"The Nancy Drew computer games are a lot of fun, although they all follow the same basic formula: mysterious happening, lots of puzzle solving and errand running to get clues, and a limited number of suspects to question. However, if the games weren't so much fun and so well made, I wouldn't continue to give them high reviews. Secret of the Old Clock is based off of Nancy's very first case, and is set in the Depression era. The graphics are charming as usual, and the suspects are animated fairly well; I was impressed at how the voices synched with the mouths. Unlike some other people, I thought that parts of this game were HARD. (The sewing machine puzzle, especially, had me working on it for days as there's no way to find a hint to get around it.) The storyline itself was engaging and pleasant enough, and there are some fun mini games you can play, like miniature golf.More of the same, good quality, fantastic-for-girls games that the Nancy Drew series is known for. Can't wait to play the next one."
16431,1,"If you have Frontpage 98, get rid of it and buy this version. I had Frontpage 98 and so many things are harder to do in it than it is in Frontpage 2000.If you are toying with the idea of trying a piece of software out to create webpages for you, this is a great one. However if you are new to doing webpages, you might want to read the book that comes with this so you will understand what you are doing.One warning and this has occurred in several areas, not many of the real neat Frontpage web objects that you can insert on your webpage will work with the &quot;free&quot; 5MB of free space your ISP provider gives you with a internet access subscription. This even includes simple stuff like counters and navigation bars.I think there is a way you can get this stuff elsewhere, I just haven't tried this yet. However the point is, some of the whiz-bang stuff Frontpage gives you won't work on these sites. So if you make this real glitzy cool page before you start uploading to your website, don't be surprised when it balks and says you don't have support for these features.What I also liked about this product over Frontpage 98, was that the ftp interface was easier to use, one button and one address gets you where you need to go. Also, the new page checking mechanism with a task scheduler makes it neat to keep track of the work you are doing on each page.I'm still not using much of the full capacity. However, the ease of use of this product made it real simple for me to upload a page and photos to my ISP's provided home page to sell some stuff on ebay. That is initially all I wanted to use it for and I was struggling to do this before.I am confident that this will also make it a whole lot easier for me to do even more complicated pages in the future. Since it is easy to get to the html code, I can alter that and see the results before I publish.The only negative is the lack of support for the neater features, I hope Microsoft would work out some of these issues so we can use all of it's capability by the next release."
33635,1,"This Media Suite will make even the pro's happy. Having said that here's why. I have used Adaptec/Roxio Easy CD since Version 2.0.1 and in all that time this by far is the largest and most complete overhaul of this already excellent software Suite ever!! And even better because of the new Engine in ECD 7 you don't have to remove the older version of the suite before you install the new version. This suite includes everything from CD burning to DVD burning and everthing in between (VCD/SVCD/PhotoCD/Capture) you name it this baby does everything. The new Help section and tutorial section is the best Help section of any software suite I have ever seen, as for all the pro's out there the Media Home GUI has a link to everything this software does so there's no hunting and searching high and low for what this puppy can do it's all right there. BUY THIS PROGRAM you will NOT be disappointed!!!!"
46888,1,"We have about a $2 million service company with a little of everything and I have to tell you I love this product. I am not fooled by what it is and what it is not. I am sure if your business is complex you need to be somewhere else, but for small businesses that do not have exotic needs this package works ...period. I am constantly amazed by the features. Yes it is a fancy check book, but cash flow is where the information action is for smaller companies with out a lot of assets to worry about. Very nice invoicing, pretty good inventory if you have any (we don't). When I reconcile the check book we are never off by a penny, I like that.Don't think you are buying a system suited for GM or IBM or any complex asset intensive or complex billing type company. But for many of us out there with money in and money out it is great."
84527,1,I recently had my hard drive wiped out because I had a computer virus. I got this program because I wasn't satified with how my other program handled the virus. This program works so well. It has a live update and it checks every e-mail incoming and outcoming. It is constantly monitoring my computer system. I recommend this product.
60352,1,I still think this is a good program but I will add a word of caution. I had every intention of buying this program through their Web site until I read the fine print. The price of the software includes one year of remote access (net2go) but they will AUTOMATICALLY charge your credit card for an additional year at the then going rate UNLESS you cancel by the end of the one-year period. I don't like this approach and am disappointed that this company is resorting to this tactic. [...]
83018,1,"I've been using this theory and software on all of my projects since 1997 and every time it has helped me write a better, more inventive and better-structured story. Sure, it was a steep learning process--but writing is in essence a steep learning process--and writing with Dramatica gave me a clearer understanding on how stories work and how all of its parts work together. This is specially useful in the development process, when you need to know how each of your elements work in order to preserve your original idea through the rewrites. In fact, Dramatica made the learning curve shorter: after writing the first drafts with it, taking notes from a producer is a breeze."
38988,1,"If you're reading this. You want to upgrade, your old computer to Windows XP Professional Edition here are a few things to keep in mind.First thing is, you can download service pack two for Windows update. So no need to buy it integrated with XP.These are what I consider the minimum system requirements:256 MB of RAM. I have found is adequate more equals better.500 MHz or higher will do.7200 rpm hard drive will help a lot.If you're running Windows millennium edition, or 98 upgrade now the stability is vastly improved. Gone are the blue screens of death.Frequently asked question: is Windows XP Pro better than home edition?Windows XP Pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing. So for most users Windows home edition is fine. They both are based on the same code and are almost identical.If you're thinking of upgrading from Windows 2000, I did, because I like the GUI interface better. But Windows XP is as stable as Windows 2000. So it's your call.The plug-and-play ability of Windows XP is totally great! Windows XP will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards, network cards, etc. that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for CDs with drivers.I recommend upgrading to Windows XP be a professional or home edition. It is a great operating systemHave some fun and get it done"
54270,1,"Dragon NaturallySpeaking has come to me at the right time, I just started grad school and at the same time I have learning difficulty. What I find with Dragon is the ability to write papers fluently, and fairly quickly. Whereas a would struggle putting thoughts to paper, with this program I don't have such problems. I do find that it takes a little training to make it as accurate as possible. By working through the training program and let it read your Word documents and e-mails it does become more accurate. For me so far, I find the program in valuable and would highly recommend by it."

76336,1,Turbo Tax Deluxe installed cleanly on Windows XP Pro with no problems but every time I went to use Turbo Tax there were updates.I was never sure when I should submit my Tax return because maybe in a few days or weeks there would be more updates perhaps affecting what I would owe.An update should be a rare occurrence but with this product it is routine. They need to get it right at time of release.Another irritant is that the Turbo Tax cover letter throws off the print out of the return for those with 2 sided printers. Page 1 of 1040 ends up on on the back of one of Intuit's cover letter pages. The IRS doesn't want to see Intuit's words of wisdom with my return I am sure.In order to avoid this problem it is necessary to save the return as a PDF file then select the proper 1040 Page 1 as the start of printing.
23621,1,"This package works extremely smoothly and accurately. The way it is priced is confusing however (more below). FineReader is not only easy to use and accurate, coping with curved lines of text coming from scanned book pages, recognizing tables, fonts and preserving layout of the scanned image, but it also organizes your work, saves images in batches, and keeps track of which image you have proofread, modified and saved. While you're proofreading you can see the part of the image about which there are questions. After the briefest of practice sessions I dove into a 700-page project and it went totally smoothly. The Abbyy website also offers you a fully functional free trial version that you can download.Regarding price, if you have any -- that is any -- OCR software already installed on your computer -- such as came with your scanner, the Abbyy website informs you that you are entitled to the ""upgrade"" version of this package, which costs only half as much as the ""full"" version! I had thought that ""upgrade"" was only useful for those with previous versions of FineReader, but this is not the case. I wonder how many people have paid the extra $150 not knowing this fact."

26101,2,"I purchased dvd x copy xpress about 5-6 days ago. Prior to my purchase, I spent 2 weeks reading reviews and I tried the trail version. All reviews were positive and the trail version worked excellent. After my purchase days ago and 20 calls to support later, The product still doesn't work. The support had me delete files and add other files and now my computer has problems and the worst of all the product still doesn't work. The last time I called, The tech of tier 2 wanted me to repeat what I did the day before. If it didn't work the day before, Why would that work now ?? I asked to speak with a supervisor and they said he would call me in about 15 minutes. Many hours later someone called and left their email address. Stay away form this company. The support is a joke. I'm sure if the product worked it would be a great product. Don't let the trail version fool you. The actual product may not work on your computer and the support doen't know how to get it working. I'm so disappointed in this product. I now have another piece of software that doesn't work.I will continue to look for software to back up my dvd's but this is not it. I now have to try to get my computer back functioning correctly. If you have to call support, don't let them delete and add things to your computer. If the product doesn't work, just find another product that will."
17763,1,"My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present. He has really enjoyed playing it so far. He can do most of the activities without help. There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain). There are many different learning activities: matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did. We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP."
50784,1,"I used a photo of my cat for my photo CD. Everything printed exactly where I put it. I did get it for free. I emailed them to check if it was just a demo. It was the complete package. I was ready to pay for it. I use glossy paper, so my picture looked like a photo. Resizing for placement was easy. Lettering was easy. I am very satisfied. Lots of features."
79180,1,"The photos in this collection are as good as any from the other major players like PhotoDisk and Eye Wire ... and they typically charge hundreds for a disk with 100 photo objects.In addition to the great variety of objects, they are all set with a clear (alpha) background which makes them very easy to work with. Photos can be saved as jpg, gif, tiffs and more.The interface is the best yet. If you allow for a full install (149 megs) you will be able to search by keyword and view thumbnails on your pc without every needing to look at the full color book of images that comes with the software. Each image uses many keywords so your search results in lots of choices.The software also will allow you to create titles that combine any graphic and any font. For example, you could combine the words July 4th with images of American flags ... or spell water using an image of the ocean.I buy lots of software (too much) and this was an absolute delight. It may be the only image collection you'll ever need. An OUTSTANDING VALUE. It deserves more than 5 stars."

46275,2,"Too bad Amazon won't let me rate this product at less than 1 star, because it doesn't even deserve that.Like many other Mac OS Lion users who have been abandoned by Quicken/Intuit, I've been looking for another finance app. I was using demo versions of iBank, See Finance, and MoneyDance side by side for comparisons. The jury is still out on the other two, but MoneyDance is now in my Trash Can.Import of previous data from Quicken was a disaster. I was in the habit of saving new Quicken Data files every year, so I have multiple data files. Even just working with my current data from 2011, the result was utter chaos. MoneyDance imported transactions without carrying over the opening balances, so all my accounts were screwed up and I had to correct the opening balances manually. Then I discovered that vast numbers of transactions were being duplicated because they were transfers from one account to another (for example, paying my mortgage involved a transfer of funds from ""Checking"" to ""Mortgage"".) My account balances were hopelessly screwed up.I deleted all my data and started over, this time I exported each account from Quicken individually. So I had separate QIF files for checking, savings, mortgage, etc....Still had to correct all the opening balances by hand. And since ""checking"" was the first account I started with, each subsequent account that I imported screwed up my transactions & balances even more. So I had to delete ""Checking"" AGAIN, create it again, and then re-import all my transactions and correct the opening balance again.It was then that I realized that NONE of my old Quicken categories had been carried over into MoneyDance. I now have thousands of transactions in multiple accounts with no categories for any of them. I am not about to go back and manually enter all that info. So therefore the Reporting features are worthless to me.And oh, by the way, all the old accounts that I deleted mysteriously kept reappearing. I deleted them again, and they reappeared again. With the result that I had multiple accounts named ""checking"", etc. And I accidentally imported a year's worth of transactions into the wrong one, so had to start all over again.This is just ridiculous. Doesn't anyone test this software before releasing it to the public? SeeFinance imported all my data from Quicken correctly the FIRST time, with all associated categories and opening balances. iBank didn't... I had to enter the opening balances manually again, but at least it handled my categories correctly and old deleted accounts stayed gone.My advice to all Mac users looking to transfer data from Quicken: stay the heck away from MoneyDance."

Mac hardware is more than worth the money because you can run a superior OS, namely Tiger.I remember when I was switching from my 486 to my Quadra 650 and I actually kept the 486 at my desk for a week just in case I wanted to use it -- and I never, ever looked back, not for so much as half of a second. The Mac OS provides the best, most productive, most satisfying user experience there is.I like to explain it as the Mac OS being a beautiful 17-year old female and Windows as being a 17-year old boy dressed like a girl -- your choice.Tiger is the first time the Mac OS has been so impressive and robust -- even as a seasoned Mac user I am impressed at how well everything runs and the degree of finish overall to each part of the OS.

That is finding my position on a boat or ship by using celestial bodies at night as well as the day. All though we have depended on electronic navigation for most all of these tasks for years, a master must know his celestial navigation. If his boat batteries or electical system ever fail or the equipment ever fails which happens more often than one would think. There lies the reason I found originally bought this software, because I found books and other aids so complicated I was getting more confused than help.On a good night (very clear) there are so many stars it is hard to pick out the big dipper. On a bad (overcast) night you are lucky to find the moon. With this software, you simply plug in your estimated location, the date and time and it shows you a great moving clestial map in several formats that my 7 year old nieces were having no problem using the program in minutes. No telescope or extra equipment is required but a pair of binoculars helped pick out some of the weaker stars.Books, aids, educational toys helped in the past learn and helped pick out the stars but on this one night, two 7 year olds and a 50 year old Master Mariner and his wife became experts (in our minds) in finding the constellations, major stars, planets and even satalites. I have never had such a good time with my family, and never felt so good about my professional ability.I am ready for the advanced versions of this product now and can not wait to buy a good telescope to get get to a level of a good amature astronomer.

37387,1,"For people who enjoy customizing software and fine tuning results, this is much better than Roxio's basic offerings, although I haven't used their premier apps. Once you get the hang of the steps involved, Nero is very efficient.One thing that initially bugged me was that &quot;Joliet&quot; wasn't checked by default for ISO burning. Without it, filenames are truncated back to the Stone Age, so watch out for that setting. I'd experiment with CD-RWs before you fully understand Nero anyhow.I would caution that people who prefer their software dumbed-down (or are terminally afraid of computers) may find Nero frustrating, unless they stay forever in Wizard mode. It's one of those programs you really have to dive into to appreciate. The spotty Help menu assumes a lot goes with saying, but so far there's nothing I haven't been able to figure out.Nero does a great job with VCDs, by the way. Before, I was playing around with &quot;VCDEasy&quot; (freeware) but this gives much better results with no guesswork. The biggest flaw in Nero is the CD jacket creator.

He didn't do his homework. So I ended up helping him reinstall XP to factory and THEN installing Vista. He is rocking and rolling now.So people, do your homework and here's some advice. Run the Vista Upgrade Advisor, look at the programs you all ready have installed and get in touch with the vendor to make sure their software plays nice with Vista. If it doesn't then look at incurring a fee to buy the version that does. If you look at everything in advance then there are no suprises; and yes, Norton Internet Security will have to be upgraded to the Vista capable version but I all ready knew that because I did my homework."
36941,0,"This program had a lot of features, but I was disappointed about the features it didn't have. There was no way to change what kind of materials are used to build the walls in order to get a good estimate of the cost if you want anything other than aluminum siding. The program was sometimes difficult to use and lacked the polish of a finished product when it came to intuitive functioning. It wasn't great, but for the occassional user it might be adequate. I know it wasn't everything I wanted it to be and I am just a hobbyist home designer. The only thing that makes it worth buying is the difference in price of several hundred dollars to get the next better quality version. If you aren't using it professionally, there is no reason to spend hundreds of dollars on a program, and this is the best you will get for the price."
73464,1,"I am a mild learner of japanese. I teach myself. i have average intelligence and can propbably re-late to most people reading this.I am teaching myself japanese. The rosettsa stone will work ofr oyu if you have patience and some critical thinking skills.It is not perfect I agree but it is the best out htere right now. Some of the images are grainy, yes, but so what? If oyu have to have enverything be perfect for you then youmight need some head doctor to analyze what its wrong with you and not take it out on this softaware.It is a basic program that deals with repitition on a computer. Which can be used over and over. I suggest that you buy volume 1 alone to see if you like it before commiting to both volums at one time. This allows you to get in on new technology when you finish p[art 1.It is slow going if you are not a genius, or familiar with the japanese language. If you have responsibilities in life such as a job, or full time classes, in all fairness the level 1 should take you about 9 months to a year and a half to finish. This is even studying everyday. But of course if you know some basic japanese structure it could take even less time. Or if you are at an intermediate level you coul finish this in a few months at most.I will take a stand and make these claims. I am not the smartest and not much better than the dumbest person. So it really boils down to how well you learn normally. If you are always a quick learner this will not be difficult. If you are a slow careful learner this will not be difficult but will take you time. THat brings me to mention the time involved. People will say ""takes 1 lesson each week, 12 lessons equal 12 weeks"". If you are a robot sure. But as human beings you cannot allocate your time this way. SOme lessons take longer. And if you have other hobbies or friends or family, you will be filling your brain with other things than just rosetts stone japanese.IN short. My advice is to buy just lesson 1 and see what you think. It is somewhat expensive, but gas is almost $3.00 a gallon and it is almost 2008. Soda is not 5 cents and good sushi is half the cost of this alone in any major city in the USA (so I hear).Did this help you? If so check my other reviews on japanese language books. I write all from a beginners perspective. And I am my own Sensee.Enjoy."

47909,0,"Children will get quite a kick out of this game continually playing with the dogs on a daily basis. As an adult though, at first it will seem cute having the dogs mate with one another to see what the puppies will look like. All in all if you have a children it is a gem, for adults, though I would pass on this one.Also one of the annoying points is that the microphone is extremely hard to work if it ever works at all. If you are set on buying a Dogz game, stick with Dogz III, has no mike and is cheaper."
72547,2,"I recently purchased this pack. The graphics in the game are exceptional, right down to the images of the characters in each of the games. There are hidden treasures everywhere in the castle, particularly in treasure chests, suits of arms, vases or just about anything laying about in the corridors. The treasures are usually in the form of Bertie Bott Beans, Pumpkin Pasties, Chocolate Frogs, things that you can use to later redeem items from Fred and George's Magic Shop.Though it is quite fun to cast spells, retrieve items and perform various other forms of magic, I was extremely displeased when after several tries, I could not manage to exceed in any of the first challenges in any of the games. One particular problem in the challenges was to jump from one pillar to another. As the game progressed, it became increasingly harder to jump without falling into, what I would assume to be called ""The Pit of Dispair"", as any time that one falls into this pit, they must again meet challenges that they have already exceeded at.This game really put a number on my computer mouse and on my wrists. These games would be best suited for a child or adult who is suffering from extreme boredom AND someone who has a great amount of time on their hands."
10037,1,"i run this plug in off of sony acid 6 pro, it doesent appear to be a stand alone program so its going to relay on other program. but the program plug in is very nice. there an engine where you can plug in a sound and it maps it to the keyboard controler. with the large library of sounds plus the engine make it unlimited expandability and functionaly. its not overly fancy but it get the dirty work done.its not perfect but for what it cost and what its does, its a plus. the interfece on the on screen plug in are a little bit covoluted but i suppose over time i'll figure out all the small things."
13827,1,"The title says it all. Encyclopeadia Britannica 2004 Deluxe Edition features the entire 33 volume books, additonal volumes starting at 1993, Webster's dictionary, theasaurus, articles from the people who made history including notibles like Albert Einstein, world maps and a functional interface that has some problems with the search function and being somewhat sluggish.The critisism of old information may be true although I profess, I don't spend that much time focusing on one region of the world that changes incredibly quickly. Articles are in-depth and well notated. The language is at times almost poetic and on occasion technically intimidating. The difference between this and the more expensive version may help those of us that want to read about sub-atomic particles without needing to take notes. Yet this attention to detail is why Encyclopeadea Britanica is so world acclaimed. The information on complex subjects is written to the complexity of the subject. Read articles on domesticated house pets and you won't drown in a sea of formulae and densely written text. At it's best Encyclopadea Britannica brings new detail to the subject at hand. Looking over the word ""drum"" brought about a scholarly response with unexpected richness while at the other end of the spectrum was the Britannica's discussion on Zappa, Frank - typing it in as Frank Zappa gets you nowhere, the strict adherence of proper language important as the flowery prose written about the deceased Composer/Rock Star/Satirist. Zappa would be having a good laugh at the cereberal treatment of his work. Encyclopaedia Britannica takes itself seriously if not laboriously.The Encyclopaedia Britannica 2004 Ultimate Reference Suite may make some discussions a bit easier as there are three versions based on school age along with dictionary tools of similar age groupings. You get about 5000 extra multimedia elements which are probably interesting but hardly necessary. The reference suite seems age based in a completeist way.Encyclopaedia Britannica 2004 Deluxe Edition has the same tools as it's larger, higher priced version. It stays within the adult realm. This is a serious thing to consider as you are expected to have well rounded educational skills in this adult version. Having not used this software before it is hard to say the quality is better or worse than previous editions. The updates are generally dated at 2002 as are the Encarta discussions.One major difference is getting to additional information. You get a full year's worth of content updates opposed to Encarta's fixed date of October 2004. You also are spared having to open an extra internet account (MSN) which Encarta asks of you. Premium services are available for 60 days with an offer to purchase an extra year of premium services at $25. This is slightly less than half price should you join Britannica's online service for 12 months. Again, with Encarta you must become a MSN user with a flat fee of $4.95 a month for their premium service which is often where the expanded content is.Therefore, Encyclopaedia Britannica is a better value and doesn't tie you into propriatary services, a real disincentive when you have high speed access and are expected to pay for much of the depth of Encarta's information.What you need to consider is:1. how do you best learn? If it is visually then you may find Britannica to be a bit on the boring side. As one that enjoys visuals I can say I don't miss them in the face of so much inforation available within Encyclopaedia Britannica. But in terms of media and a fun quotient Encarta is hard to beat.2. what education level are you comfortable learning in? Again, Encyclopaedia Britannica doesn't compromise much. There is more substance here but with the expectation you will put effort into checking areas you are unfamiliar with. This is very much a encyclopedia in the real sense of the word. But for the good cross reference tools and links to other sites you are reading a book, not ""experiencing"" information which is Encarta's strongest point and weakest point at once.3. should you upgrade? Based on others who seem hell bent to pummel this excellent CD set it seems the answer is no. It may be better to stick with Britannica's web solution instead.In conclusion, Encarta beats Britannica hands down in terms of interface, performance speed and colorful content. But Britannica's best suit is the addition of a theasauras, dictionary, world map, study tools and content. Britannica also has vastly more detail and articles, it's Year in Review books from 1993 to 2002 along with about the same up to date material as Encarta. In terms of comparing software it isn't fair to compair Encarta Deluxe with Britannica Deluxe, the amount of additional material in Britannica Deluxe compares favorably with Encarta Reference Library where again, Britannica wins in most every catagory of information.I can't give Britannica five stars due to it's slower operation and less developed interface. Nor could I give it any less than 4 stars based on information and find it astonishing that reviewers here are so rough on this wonderful software. Should you want the best of both worlds I'd suggest both Britannica and Encarta but I would also warn you that Encarta Reference Library is the way to go as it is substantially more developed than Encarta Deluxe.Of the two Britannica is the superior package, providing comprehensive knowledge is what you are looking for."

13471,2,"I need to file in three states, and I foolishly assumed that a ""45 multi state"" package would do 45 states. It will do only one. Intuit's response? ""Yeah, it'll do 45 states, just not all at once."" It reminds me of the old joke about the shop keeper which had the sign that said ""open 24 hours"". When he would close he would tell people ""Yeah, we're open 24 hours. Just not in a row.""YOU HAVE TO BUY TWO COPIES TO DO TWO STATES. Very misleading."
53456,0,"I'd read reviews for a lot of these types of programs, and it seemed to have the fewest complaints. Well, for $100, I expected much much more. It's probably OK if you want the most basic simplistic approximation of a space, but you cannot:1. Customize any objects. Got a curved counter or shelf? Forget it! The so-called CAD tools are for floor plans only, you cannot create your own 3D objects.2. Import any pictures or textures. Want to put in your carpet or wood grain or marble or stucco, or art or whatever? Forget it!3. Import any 3D objects. Would aleviate a lot of problems. Other programs allow it. Forget it!4. Adjust texture directions. Put wood grain on a molding. Note the direction of the grain. Want to rotate it 90 degrees, so it looks right? Forget it!5. Export to ANY 3D format. Want to share the design via VRML or 3DS or ANYTHING? Forget it! It does export DXF, but only the flat floor plan.So again, if you don't mind the barest basics, this is an easy and fun program. But if you want to get an idea of what your place would look like if you actually put in the stuff you wanted, there ain't no way, unless you happen to use the boring objects they ship with."
18716,1,"This was a Christmas gift we purchased for our 8-year-old son who loves music. He was reluctant to try it, as he thought it'd be too hard to use. Once he got started on it, he plays it about 1 hour per day. He makes his own songs & saves them to the hard drive. We also save them as .wma files, so windows media player can use them. He's used the e-mail feature (with some help) to send his music creations to grandparents. We've also copied them over to his PSP (Sony Playstation Portable) and he takes them on-the-road on road trips & shared them with kids while at daycare during Winter Break. Most of his songs have a lot of drums & word-phrase looping, but that's how he likes it. He starts off a new song w/drums, guitars, bass, etc. & adds word loops here & there. It's really easy for him, as he just picks what type of instrument from a pick list & then scrolls through all the possibilities (many looping sounds from each instrument to pick from). You use a paintbrush to paint in that sound on a staff-like group of bars to the right & you repeat this again w/another instrument. You can see all your music at once & where each instrument sound starts & stops (which can have many of each). This is a great computer game & we've found so many more uses for the created music (like background music for a computerized photo album). We haven't tried the RECORD feature, as we don't have a microphone on the PC, but he'll probably be singing to that once we buy one. It was really easy for him to use & his 6-year-old sister can use it with a little help too. You can change the tempo & key the masterpiece is played in & the volume of each individual instrument playing. This was well worth the money we spent."

But for the fancy stuff, users need a more comprehensive system such as Mandriva 2007, or the Mandriva 2007 Power Pack. The Spring 2007 version of Mandriva 2007 includes KDE 4.0.After trying Mandriva One on a new machine several months ago, I can only say, I don't recommend it. It's too basic, and not worth it, now that Mandriva has worked out some of the bugs from its newest 2007 generation."

44792,1,"wow. I can't believe the other reviews of this piece of software. I bought it in September, when I got back to school. My teacher had recommended this one. I found it was really good at helping me calm down, learn to take my time, understand the question behind the questions. The methods for working the math programs, the ways to read those long, dense passages -have all helped me feel totally confident that I'll do well on the SAT. I've been looking at the ACT disk, too. I'm actually thinking that after seeing it, I may take that test too.My parents loved the Paying for school calculator, it helped them understand how much it's going to cost, and how the heck to pay for it all. And I know better now why so many people have implored me to save money from summer jobs! :)Some of the jokes were definitely corny, but overall, outstanding practice, great material, and I feel totally prepared for the big day. Thank you Kaplan!"

89717,1,"If you need a server OS then this is what you want.I purchased a copy of Advanced Server 2000 about 6 months ago just to keep on the shelf. I had no need for it at the time whatsoever as my servers running vanilla Server 2000 were already maxed out with dual core Pentium D and 4GB memory. However I had the foresight to know I would upgrade hardware at some point past what Server 2000 would support so wanted to be sure I was able to get Advanced Server 2000 before it became extinct.Over the past month I began acquiring the components for the miniature supercomputer I wanted to build. At the center of the machine is an Intel Xeon E3-1230 (quad core + hyperthreading = 8 logical CPUs) with 8GB DDR3 memory, and 2 SATA3 SSD drives - all on a mini-ITX board in a 150W mini case.One of the challenges installing Advanced Server at this time, is that IDE connectors are beginning to disappear - and Advanced Server doesn't know about SATA out of the box. So it took a little ingenuity to get things to install and then manually install each driver needed since the operating system could not automatically detect and find drivers - the components are too new. But, so long as you have or can find Windows XP drivers, Server 2000 generally will be able to use them.Once the software is installed, like all Microsoft products now, it does ""phone home"" and will grab all patches and updates - pulled down over 100 over them and had no problems installing any of them.One thing to note, IE version 5 is the web browser installed with this - so first thing you need to do after installing is to upgrade to IE 6 - that is the highest version that will run on Server 2000. If you don't upgrade to IE 6, then Windows Update will not work.In any case, once things are installed, on current hardware, this OS flies. Further, since this is a product from the folks Microsoft grabbed from DEC, it is rock solid and is not loaded with bloatware. My entire install is under 3GB and that is with the 100+ updates installed."

The great let down and where this product loses major points is the time taken for conversion/backing up. I stopped one of the back-ups 1/4 of the way because I didn't have the time. I was a bit more generous and gave it 3 stars since this product has great potential to be improved."

This has it all--counting, matching, coloring, and the alphabet."
53708,1,"I am a retired attorney who has experimented with earlier versions of the Dragon software over the last eight to 10 years. I was never quite satisfied with the performance of the product. However, I now own version 9 and have found it to be a very useful and accurate product. If I were still practicing law, I would unquestionably utilize a program like this in my practice. Because I did not like being tied to my computer by a microphone cable, I purchased a wireless microphone (by Nady - which I have also reviewed) which works even better than the wired headset that came with the program. The program required less than one-half hour of setup although I have continued to train the program to meet the needs of my particular voice patterns. This dictation is much more accurate than my typing, and I have found that correcting errors is a fairly simple process as well. My only regret is that I purchased the basic program, rather than an advanced program. Now that I see how well the product works, I wish that I had a more specialized vocabulary and the ability to dictate in more than just English as I am fluent in Spanish and have a growing acquaintance with French. Incidentally, I dictated this review and use the dictation program regularly to respond to and send e-mails, as well as dictate letters, memoranda and outlines in Microsoft word. It may be relevant to note that I am not using an underpowered computer system. I have an AMD dual core system with 2 MB of RAM. I am certain that there is a combination of good programming and growing computer power that makes a program such as this functional."
7296,1,"I'm a 25 year old guy and even I like this game. My 5 year old daughter is ecstatic. She has been playing it non-stop and with 10 levels worth of stuff I'm sure she will enjoy it way more and much longer than the lame Barbie Skate game or the Barbie Horse that she has beaten 57 times.This game isn't just clothes, it lets you create the whole show. You do everything from picking models and choosing their hair and shoes to setting up the theme, decorations, lighting and music of the runway. Then you decide what poses you want the models to do and take pictures during the show.It's fun, relatively easy to learn (for my 5 year old), and has tons of replay value. The only negative thing I can think of is that the music is kind of lame. Other than that it's the best game I've ever gotten for my daughter."
20410,0,"Purchased this prior to a trip to Amsterdam and Germany. We intended to drive around Germany for week. Having used the US version with great results, I was a bit dissapointed with the outcome of this program. Our intention was to travel the roads less used through small towns but found that it did not seem to have the same level of information as the US counterpoint. Since my Garmin has maps of Europe in it, we ended up just using it from town to town.Would think about purchasing this version."

Get the picture?BBY 2003 has rad new sounds like the swings, connections withthe bat & ball etc. New people are doing voices for Vinny, Sunnyand the players. A dissapointment in BBY 2003 is a loss of 3all-stars: Mark Mcgwire, Mo Vaghn and Cal Ripken Jr. Mac was always avalible for some reason. He was a guy I counted on allthe time. Hit Dog was usually 3rd in the batting order so we could get a man on for Sosa or Mcgwire at cleanup to knock it out of the park. Albert Puljos has replaced Mark Mcgwire for his powerhouse hitting and a Gold Glove kind of guy. Greg Vaghn of the D'Rays has replaced his cousin Mo but Greg will never be as good as the Hit Dog. Jeff Conine has replaced Cal Ripken with a 3000 hit aditude and super at 3rd. Ichiro is just amazing in the outfield, basepath and the plate. BBY 2003 is a ""mom can I get this?"" kind of game."
38167,1,"After having played many Nancy Drew mystery games, I found this really refreshing. I'm only talking about the mystery game. I haven't even gotten to the horse games - which is what I bought this for. The mystery was really neat! Sure at times it seemed a bit primative but it was so European in feel. The street scenes were just really not too all-American. The scenes were really pretty - the sky, trees and buildings. Sure the voices were in American English but you could see it was done by people in another part of the world with a different idea of a city and streets. Even the punks on the park bench were unlike stuff from the U.S.A.The main character has real short red hair. No blond Barbie! and isn't a goodie two shoes. She steals keys, lies and does stuff we all do that no one is afraid of putting in software for fear of being sued as a bad role model for girls!that's enough! Hey in the time where all software is sooooooooooo much the same- more worried about liability than entertainment - this is not perfect but refreshing!"

So when there was a question as to how to play.. you had to try to find it within the game (which also wasn't very user friendly).We are both tech-savyy people and it seemed this 'simple' game was more complicated than it needed to be.It didn't have the same feel as the original. I know that they tried to update to keep up with the times but it wasn't quite the same."

The first thing I noticed was they haven't updated their icons in the last 6 years. A bad omen right there. Then, I could not get it to import zip codes from an Excel sheet. I had to copy the data to plain text. My biggest complaint is the near-lack of the ability to drag the screen with the mouse. The only place to drag the screen is around the edges. It's horrible. Anywhere else on the screen, you get this ridiculous zig-zag cursor that's supposed to zoom in/zoom out. It doesn't even work 100%. I would consider different mapping software."

58640,2,"One look at the included titles is pretty impressive, but the program itself is hard to use and poorly designed. I have used many different bible study programs including e-Sword, Bibleworks 6, Logos, WordSearch, Online Bible, SwordSearcher and others. Quickverse 2005 is worse than all of these in terms of it's useability.It's not so much that it is hard to use, but just is annoying to get around and the features are poorly implimented. One example would be the popup verse refrences. When you put your mouse over a verse refrence while reading a verse, a new window pops up with the verse. The problem is that it has this annoying thick border around it as compared to a tooltip style used by most other programs. Once this thing pops up it is hard to get rid of it! There is no way of closing it except to move your mouse to another refrence (popping up a new refrence) and quickly away to a section of the text with no refrence. Many times I have switched active windows to another program only to have this annoying popup in the way, which forces me to return to Quickverse to get rid of it.There are other examples, but the point is that either this program is in an early stage of development, which shouldn't be the case at version 9, or the developers are not very skilled at writing user friendly software. They make it look good in an advertisment, but it's disappointing to say the least.Having used all major Bible software programs out there, I would suggest that if you want a comprehensive suite and you can spend hundreds of dollars, buy LOGOS. You can find the Scholars edition for around $400 discounted on the net.If Quickverse offers some resources you must have and you can't afford LOGOS, then be sure to look around for a deal. I have seen Quickverse 2005 Deluxe selling new for $125.00 plus shipping (which says a lot since the ""retail"" is $299.00).You would do even better to just download e-sword, which is free and offers a much better set of tools than Quickverse and has a large number of free Bibles, commentaries and other resources available. It's more than what most people need and you can send the money you saved to support a missionary!"

If you haven't backed up, this seems a good way of dealing with it, as you don't run the risk of losing anything, as nothing is being rebuilt during the process. You can get your files back and then work out how to save the drive later, perhaps with Disk Warrior. It worked for me."

41931,1,"I have used DVD X Copy v1.4 to make copies of about 30 movies so far with great results. The only problems I have experienced have been with discs of The Sopranos and Band of Brothers. For some reason, these multiple episode discs do not copy properly.I am using a generic DVD drive to rip the disc, and a Sony DRU500A to record . ... combo.The fact that most movies require 2 discs is not a flaw in the software. Most commercial DVD's are recorded in 2 layers, allowing over 8 gig of data on a disc. Current recorders can only record to one layer, limiting data levels to app.4.7 gig.This software does all that can be done without data compression. My solution to multiple discs was to buy one of the current generation of DVD changers and load both discs."

I'm just a firm believer in not having to release a new version of something if you haven't made a drastic change. College textbooks have scarred me for life.

Before buying audio software make sure your drivers are updated and well written specifically for the card. Otherwise you will probably have problems like most of the other users writing reviews. By the wayside... This program is an older version of logic with cut-down logic-type vsti support. Definitely worth it's price not to mention the sample cd's."
6242,1,"This is a must for piano students and music majors alike! The authors did a fantastic job of making the entire experience intuitive. It was totally easy to install. You don't have to read a single manual to get going. I don't think I've ever used the 'help' feature, nor do I know if it HAS a help feature.This product can be best thought of as a game that is divided into lessons. Each lesson is a variation on the same game with varying degrees of difficulty. The objective is to get the best score you can. After a few minutes of playing the first lesson, I could actually close my eyes and play, and still scored high!I only found two draw backs. It runs hot on my laptop - I suspect this may have something to do with the way the graphics are managed, or perhaps the game loop - it eats 45% of the CPU on my dual core machine. The other issue is that I was hoping my MIDI keyboard would work with it, I'm not sure if I misinterpreted the literature, but, even so, I still find significant value in the lessons anyway."

62189,0,"My three year old son really enjoyed this game, but from the point of view of the parent, I thought it was much too short. The original Reader Rabbit Preschool is much longer and more challenging. Sparkle Star Rescue begins at an easy level and gets only slightly more challenging as the child plays. It can be finished in a few hours of play time. The child earns reward gems for playing, but earns the most important ones first. Once all the important gems are earned, he or she is encouraged to fit them in their slots and finish the game. Any extra playing he or she would have done is cut short by this, though the child is free to start the game over from the beginning. Overall, I don't think this game was worth the money but my son enjoys it."
69973,1,Previous to buying this game we only had educational software for my six year old son. It's a really easy game for a young child to use plus it helps raise interest and familiarity with computers. He's got really good at this and we'll buy more lego software I'm sure. The only downside to this game is that he's got so good at it that I don't stand a chance.

51030,1,"Dorling-Kindersley's My First Amazing Incredible Dictionary is an absolute delight! Pre-readers up through 3rd graders (or so) will find this software easy to use and intriguing. The graphics, animation, and sounds are mesmerizing. Any child who can point and click can easily entertain himself for at least 30 minutes at at time. After clicking on a letter of the alphabet, the child is taken to a page with pictures of words for that letter, arranged in dictionary format. A click on any picture sends the child to the page for that word. The child then has the option to click on the word itself or the word's definition, which will result in voicing of the text. The child can click on the large colorful photgraph or cartoon drawing depicting the word. The fun is in discovering what will happen with this click. Will it be animation of the picture, a sound or both? Whatever the case, children are usually delighted. The vocabulary items include the obligatory concrete nouns, but also abstract verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepostions. There are easy links provided for words with the same spelling but different meanings. I have used this software with hearing impaired, speech impaired, and learning disabled children at work as a speech/language pathologist. All of them loved it. Besides the dictionary, there are games that children will find fun to try alone or with a friend. Enjoy!"
20175,1,"I used to do a lot of family desktop publishing from Microsoft Publisher. I never liked that program because it was hard to use. Picture It! Publishing, on the other hand, is very easy to use -- and offers all the tools a family publishing fan wants. You can get up and running in just a few minutes, and the program is intuitive. Definitely the best such program I have used. I tested the program on Windows ME and Windows 2000 systems and it was rock solid and never crashed. (Of course, your mileage may vary.) I eventually installed it on a Win2k laptop and have been very happy."

After a month of use, it is still working fine with my LCD monitor. I am able to get pretty good color matching with my color prints. However, the whole process of color matching through Photoshop is still a huge complicated mess, and I have taken color classes and worked in the field of color ink jet printing. Thus the huey will not solve all of your color problems. If you don't care about accurate printing and just want to see spectacular views on your monitor, you don't need a huey."
71210,0,"I have owned Encarta, included in the product, for about four years, upgrading each year from the previous version. I love the product.The new 2007 product is quite different in the GUI but the product is essentially the same: great.However, here is the negative: you must have Microsoft Office 2003 installed to use the ""Learning Essentials"" Module that is an option buried within this program. If you do not have Office 2003, do not install Learning Essentials. Not knowing that you MUST have Office 2003 Student, Pro or Standard Edition (not Office 2003 XP version -- this version of Office 2003 won't work), I installed Learning Essentials. It hosed my Microsoft Word 2000. I could not open Word 2000 at all. After calling Microsoft ""India"" I was kindly told the above. When you read the fine print on the side of the box you see that they require Office 2003 to work all Student and Encarta components.Unintalling ""Learning Essentials"" is/was not easy. My new laptop took over an hour to uninstall this included program. Apparently after you unintall Learning Essentials, Word 2000 will work again. Don't know yet as I am still waiting on the uninstall to complete....Buy/install Office 2003 Standard, Pro or Student version before buying this product."
89153,1,"Every once in while, there is just no choice for dedicated MAC users but to use some antiquated ""windows only"" app. When that happens, Parallels Desktop is an excellent solution on any Intel MAC. The desktop loads easily and makes loading Windows a snap. Running Windows Vista as a window in OSX works great. (Of course all of the quirkiness of Windows is still there.) The desktop does not require dedicated hard drive space, it starts and shut down quickly and switching between OSX and WIN is a snap - which means you can easily limit WIN to only those times its really necessary. The only glitch that I found is that the internet connection must be ""connected"" each time WIN starts up, which probably protects WIN from infestation when not in use - its just a pain to remember to connect it every time. Overall, this is a good product that works as advertised."
63688,2,"Tech support is a maze of back and forth emails. The version for iPhone is a $50 a year subscription. Daylite is made up of these separate programs Daylite, Daylite mail inegration, Daylite Server, iPhone App. They constantly upgrade to fix bugs introduce from the last upgrade. If you can get the program to work then don't upgrade. All my data is stuck on my laptop on a locked out offline database which can't be backed up. You can't transfer data.... they are so scared you will make illegal copies on other machines they have made it impossible for legit users to get the full use from it.When you do find help it's in the form of a Daylite authorized partner who will charge you. The report engine is archaic and requires more technical knowledge to generate reports than most users posses. You can filter your data, but there is no organization if you have a lot of filers. You can't group like filters.My prediction will be since Macintosh is at 20% US market share... it won't be long before ACT! decides it's worth it to make a Mac version again. Once that happens Daylite will magically improve as their market share goes down.Is the program totally bad... um no.

67670,1,"I purchased this software a year ago. Find it very easy to use. I probably ask more of it than the average person would,and it delivers. I used it on 20 old B&W family photos taken back in the 30's and 40's. Was able to scan, repair, and print some wonderful enlargements. On one of the snap shots of my older brother and sister taken in 1943. After enlarging you could clearly read the date on the license plate on the car behind them. Was even able to repair what looked like a coffee stain on one of the photos of my mother with the cloning tool. When you email tech support with a question they get back to you. No matter how many questions you ask they respond until your satisfied. No it is not as powerful as Adobe Photo Shop. But it's not $... either. I have been able to do everything so far that I have wanted to do with this software. I would say I'm a serious photo junkie. And shoot 35mm as well as digital photos weekly. I can't wait to try their new Photo Album 4. I purchased the boxed version of Paint Shop Pro because I like having a manual to read away from computer when learning new tricks that I would not have thought of myself. Their web site is also great for picking up great ideas from other users."

I think this is an excellent product, especially for a free/extremely cheap alternative using the Skype service."
74156,1,"I swapped to CanvasX Win after using CorelDraw for almost 20 years from Version 2 to X3. The decider for me was opening a dxf plan and seeing the UTM coordinates immediately displayed in the rulers. CanvasX knows about where things sit in space, how to scale them easily and deals with bitmaps and vector objects all within the same package. Yes, it has difficulty importing large files, yes save often, perhaps even more often than say in CorelDraw, yes it seems that Canvas has been the forgotten child in ACD System's suite of programmes. There are some features that send some users nuts judging by the discussion forums (but isn't that true of any program?). However, the word from ACD on the forums indicates that a new version (Windows only at this stage) is due out towards the end of 2007. ACD even say they've been listening to their customers' suggestions. If nothing changed, CanvasX remains, for me, a very useful, good value tool in my kit bag for producing technical illustrations. I've given a 4 star rating rather than 5 because CanvasX is much, much better than average but still has a few bugs and can be unstable and slow with big (>10Mb) vector files."

71963,1,"I use Docs To Go strictly for word processing, and version 5.0 is definitely an improvement. Typefaces can now be chosen on the PDA; and text is shown in the typeface selected -- which definitely goes a long way towards improving readability. There are also more formatting options (such as bullet points and paragraph indenting). Color is also available either in type or as a background. The net effect is to make document creation (rather than just document modification) a real Palm capability.The new software works great in both my Palm m515 and Sony Clie. And on the Clie, with its higher resolution color screen, documents look even better.The only negative I have is that the ""go to start (or end) of the document"" command has been deleted to make room for the formatting options. I don't miss it as much, however, on my Clie which has a scroll wheel for moving quickly up or down the page.As an add-on, I also like to print from my Palm using BtPrint (available at iscomplete.net), which will output from Docs To Go 5.0, as well as from my Palm's calendar, address book, memo and to do list. BtPrint will transmit via either Bluetooth or infrared (IR) from my Palm, and in IR from my Clie. I dispatch wirelessly to any one of the Bluetooth or infrared printers I have in my home or office, (using HP's excellent and reliable 990, 995, 1315 and 450 models, to be precise).As a watch-out, BtPrint will not work with the Palm 5.0 operating system, so printing from either the Tungsten T or Sony's newest units is not yet an option.I am, overall, quite happy. I can now create presentation quality documents on my Palm when I'm at home or while traveling - without having to take my bulky laptop computer with me. And when I use the new Palm ultra-slim keyboard, with its sleek, high-tech styling -- I'm the envy of all that I survey.I also recently discovered that Avery (labels) has made a Palm PDA label printing software available as a free download (at Avery.com) - which, like BtPrint, will output via Bluetooth or IR to the above same printers. I've used it - and it works great!In conclusion, why use a laptop to create a document - when using a Palm PDA is so much more convenient? Docs To Go 5.0 is definitely the way to go!"

The manual and tech support are of no use. The drivers don't work, and the device has to be removed and/or uninstalled every time you try. It makes my computer run poorly, shut down, and start up in safe mode. I did manage to get 7 short songs on it (many of them are incomplete downloads), which all sound horrible. The ear buds hurt ...and cannot be swapped out wihtout an adaptor. And it does actually skip when jostled, but don't we all? Bottom line ...the device is sitting in the package right now, and I'm searching for a decent MP3 player. DON'T BUY THIS ONE!"

We usually have an accountant handle our taxes, but this year was a nice surprise: TurboTax and the accountant were a match. I feel confident doing our own taxes next year if needed.The step-by-step workflow makes it very easy to complete your taxes, assuming you've collected all of your paperwork and you have a mug of coffee ready. The software does keep you apprised of progress and it's very useful having a tool manage what needs to be considered. The outputs can be vendor-neutral, so your work doesn't have to remain tied to the product.I don't see a problem with this software at all. I withheld a star because the updating program needed a little help getting through the process.-Fred"
46276,0,"Like many other folks, I'm looking for a Quicken alternative. I was attracted to MoneyDance by the clean, easy to use interface. For personal accounts and my one man business, it's great. You can customize the home page so the reports you use most often are at your fingertips. Downloading from Capitol One and Amex works without a problem.However, for tracking investments, it completely broke down for me. We have a complex portfolio with six accounts at one brokerage. One of these is an actively managed account which invests in foreign stocks and ADRs. Moneydance really screwed up on these, when it can't get a stock price, it substitutes a random 8 digit number; the resulting values make my portfolio big enough to pay down the national debt! Importing from Quicken was a pain, I had to manually match security names for over 200 different stocks. Quite a few transactions didn't import at all, a bunch more were incorrectly imported as double entry transactions, so account fees were deducted from one account and added to another. Downloading from Schwab requires me to retype my password for each of the six accounts.I really liked the look and feel of MoneyDance, but after a couple weeks and probably 20 hours of trying to make it work, I'm moving on to try iBank. If that doesn't work, I'll either be running Quicken for Windows, or downgrading my next Mac back to Snow Leopard and living with Quicken 2006."
73324,1,"Rosetta Stone Level 1 & 2 Personal Edition is elite software for learning Chinese and other languages. The software definitely offers complete lessons for learning traditional and simplified Chinese characters, as well as pinyin romanization. It's expensive and so some reviewers may be resentful that it doesn't embody the whole language, but along with Pimsleur this is the best software out there.My experience is simple: I loved Rosetta Stone, then left it alone thinking I'll find something more exciting. Now after Talk Now, Power Chinese and others, I'm back to using Rosetta Stone as a centerpiece for my independent Chinese language education. It's that good. It's like the best tour book for the world. You've got to get it and you use it until it's worn. Then one day you throw it over the Great Wall, or leave it behind on one sidetrip so you can get another angle of experience. But when you tell others to try something else, you still guard your CD-roms like a Qing warrior. ""No, you may not borrow it! I hate it, but it's mine.""Rosetta Stone is very intelligent, fair to people of all colors and at the polite end of the spectrum. Street slang books with cartoons and 'Making Love in Thai' are at the other end. Rosetta Stone indulges in little or none of the lurid or silly stuff. Maybe that's why I click it off and surf the web for breaks. But I click back frequently these days.How does it work? The tutorials are awesome. The user cycles through top-notch software windows with crystal clear pictures and sound and by the time the cycle is done a transformation has taken place. Characters that were once foreign are familiar- at least from the angle offered by the software. Read a book and your mind might go blank, but that changes with time. For the programmed cycles of pictures and captions and voiceovers has its eventual impact. Absolute beginners may get disillusioned, but then almost all language student do. Those reviewing Rosetta Stone low are failing to acknowledge the elite quality of this software compared to most of what is out there. The high price definitely indicates the quality. For instance, Power Chinese at $39.99 is worth about $5.00 compared to Rosetta Stone.My simple advice: try the explorer edition at about $20.00 and see how much higher the quality is than other software offered at that price. The weaknesses of Rosetta Stone can be made up in class, by listening to an expensive Pimsleur CD, and by scribbling in a good writing workbook. After two years of part-time use I have not even used the software to it's fullest. So Rosetta Stone's true value is still a mystery. In any case, I enthusiastically recommend this Five Star Product for it remains worthy of five stars no matter what it doesn't do for the student of Chinese."

69657,1,"I recently decided to change my website from a PHP based CMS (content management system - I was using one of the free open source ones) to pure HTML.I was getting tired of the work required whenever the CMS updated it's software and the havoc it would wreak on my site.I looked long and hard for a FREE WYSIWYG package (essentially ""drag and drop"" to layout my site). I can fumble my way through HTML, but I am a visual person and really prefer to lay out my site visually and let the code follow.Anyhow, I found a few really good FREE packages, only to discover that you actually had to have a specific web host in order to publish it. I'm very happy with my host so switching was not an option.I then looked at the big name software and tried some demos, only to discover they were a bit too much for my needs and not worth the money, that's when I discovered SiteSpinner on Tucows.com.I actually downloaded the demo last week, tried it and uninstalled it because it wasn't as easily intuitive as the free software I liked, but then in my search for other reasonably priced software, I saw all the glowing reviews on Amazon and other sites for this software.So, I reinstalled it and was determined to figure it out. In the end, it really wasn't that difficult to figure out. It's not the prettiest package out there, the icons and stuff aren't as cute and modern as some others, but it definately has many more useful features. It's not super packad with all the features you could ever want, but it definately is good enough for a beginner, or even a more advanced person who just likes the drag and drop features. I did have to consult the company's forums to figure a few things out, but it was a good thing because they really seem responsive and willing to help.Oh, and you also get free software updates for the life of the version you buy. For instance, the current version is V2.7, and until they hit version V3.0 you get free updates to the software.Anyhow, as far as reasonable priced drag and drop web creation software goes, this one is at the top of my list!"

52513,1,"Let me first say that I have been a diehard Quicken user for the better part of 9 years, and I am not a particular fan of Microsoft. But I have to give credit where credit is due. I decided to try Microsoft Money because Quicken's interface has recently become so cluttered with advertisements and nonsense that it has become almost impossible to navigate. In addition, my experience with Quicken Deluxe 2003 has been so incredibly bad (support, bugs, crashes, etc.) that I had to try some alternative.At first I was going to buy Microsoft Money Deluxe 2003. But, for just a little extra, I decided to try the Deluxe &amp; Business version instead. I have a small internet side business and I thought this would be a perfect fit.First, let me address the home portion of the program:This is an incredible step-up from the equivalent version of Quicken. The interface is simple, the program is not &quot;buggy&quot;, and the online help is more than comprehensive enough to get you through even the toughest of problems. Because I was already using the 2003 version of Quicken, I was not able to automatically transfer my Quicken file, so I cannot comment on how that particular feature works. But I can certainly tell you that setting up all of my accounts from scratch (and I have quite a few) was more than simple. All of the online banking features worked flawlessly, and I was up and running in about 3 hours - start to finish. And with much less frustration than with Quicken.As for the business portion of the program:This area is, admittedly, not very advanced. It is good for very small side businesses (such as mine), but for anything more comprehensive, you may want to look elsewhere. I think the problem with marketing these two features together is that a lot of people may be expecting too much out of the business portion of the program, so they tend to write-off the whole thing. This program is intended only for the very smalest home business owner. If you are looking for anything more comprehensive than that, my advice would be to invest in the standard or deluxe versions of Micrsoft Money for your personal finances, and look elsewhere for a more comprehensive accounting program for your business finances. But if you decide to go the frugal route, expect to get what you pay for.In conclusion, Microsoft Money is, in my estimation, 10x easier to use than Quicken and is laid out in a much nicer fashion. In addition, there are no bugs that I could find, whereas Quicken was giving me constant problems (browser conflicts, lock-ups, etc.) Take it from a long time Quicken user - It's not too late to switch. Go buy Microsoft Money today."

I can't believe that I wasted the money and several hours on what is no more than garbage. The one positive factor was that i got a laugh out of their Sgt Shultz attempts at english on the support site."

46787,1,"I used to avoid reading because I was so slow at it, my grades were suffering and I felt like there was nothing I could do about it. Though I would try to read my mind was somewhere else and I would have to go back and re-read. It would take me so long that I would get tired and completely give up. Thanks to Ace Reader, I have fun practicing and my reading has tripled! I can do my homework in a reasonable amount of time and go back to practicing! The customer service had lightning fast response with answers to any questions I had. I am so impressed with this product that I have given copies to my family. I went from 175wpm to 600 in 3 days and I will continue to practice and recommend this program to everyone! I can't thank Ace Reader enough!"
6776,1,"I surfed the internet for language software. It was a soupy mess! GAZILLIONS to choose from!! In the end, after reading different reviews I decided to buy this one. It is NOT the kind of language learning where you memorize nouns by nouns and verbs by verbs which is just too monotonous!. This program is like jumping in without checking how the water is first.. The way REAL people talk.. how you would talk back. And it is NOT intimidating at all; I mean, how great to talk to your computer all alone on a Wednesday night with nobody to hear how bad you are? An example of how this software works: we follow this guy from the airport in Madrid greeted by his aunt and uncle. A little movie shows him walking through the airport, etc. There is also a box which translates it for you in english. Then you have choices on your screen to choose how you want to break these words or conversations down: 1. You can slow down the pace of the speech. 2. You can click on any one word and hear it said 3. You can click on one word, hear it said, then use the microphone (provided for PC users only, Mac must use the Plain Talk mic) which records your voice and you play it back. A little meter rates how you sound compared to the local guy.. 4.You can also click on a whole phrase, hear the guy say it then you can repeat it and compare.. 5. You can also click on the 'game' icon where you have a choice of 5 games to practice with as well (also called 'sneaky learning..' ). Whatever screen you are looking at you can click on the '?' (help) button and it will show you EVERYTHING that you need to know. Like the little turtle on the screen, I kept thinking 'what the heck is that little turtle for?' I clicked on the '?' button, which opened up a sample of the page I was just on, then I clicked on the turtle. Voila! Click on this to slow up or down the speech .. Duh. guess I shoulda known. I didn't know how to work the microphone thing; click help, then the icon, it tells me to hold down my mouse while speaking..One of the reviewers of this software said that it was just way too advanced for him. I just don't think he gave it (or himself) a chance. I was TERRIFIED of buying software.. I know nothing about computers and kept thinking it would be a huge waste. I'd never figure it out. I have to tell you that I stuck it in, clicked around, READ THE '?' HELP SECTION and completely got the hang of it and am learning like mad!!The question for those who are looking to buy language software is the question of grammer based learning or jumping in and doing it. I think it's better jumping in. People say that you should just move to a country where you want to learn a language -- and who can do that?? So I'm thinking software like this is the next best thing. I have high school level spanish (which was 15 some odd years ago) and I live in Los Angeles so I know a bunch of words but couldn't figure out the whole verb meets sentence structure thing. This software is EXACTLY what I needed. No matter what you choose, you have to do is stick with it and commit to learning. You won't learn unless you use it.Oh, and the ... rebate didn't hurt, either!!"

36566,1,"My 13-year-old daughter LOVES the SIM City game. We had to get the older version which comes in this 10-pack, because her computer was not large enough (RAM) for the newer version. I caution against loading all the games at once, since they take a lot of space. However, in terms of fun, educational value and intellectual challenge, the games are fantastic.She really has not gotten much past SIM city. She looked at the Ants game briefly and thought it was a little weak.She's learned a bit about the economics and ecological balance needed to operate a city and has had fun destroying a city or two with the floods and other natural disasters you can create. It would probably really appeal to boys for that reason. It satisfies the need for bashing things up with out being violent. I enjoy watching her build things and listening to her explain how it all works together. It's surprisingly realistic."
83334,1,"I have been wanting to upgrade to Office 2007 for a long time but I kept putting it off becasue of the people who said that it was hard to use. Many said they were sorry that they had upgraded. I finally ""bit the bullet"" and bought MS Office Ultimate 2007. I have been using it about a month now and I love it. It was easy to install and, as others have pointed out, installed quickly. One of the complaints I keep reading about is the ribbon versus the old menu style. I think the ribbon is more intuitive. I admit to having to search at first for the features/menu items I wanted but once I figured out the pattern, the rest is easy.Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook are the main pieces I use and I find them much improved over the 2003 versions. I find it easier to do a mail merge in Word (and I do a lot of them). Outlook has added features such as color coding the appointments on the calendar so you can tell at a glance whether or not it is a doctor appointment or a meeting. I am still working my way through the new features but I sure like what I see so far.I use Access but sparingly - I haven't used it to develope any new databases to find out what new features it contains. I am happy that I upgraded - only wish I had done it sooner."

59515,1,This is the perfect option for those who don't want to spend a fortune on equipment and software. You get the GuitarPort hardware along with software that will give you a ton of unique sounds. If I would've known about this when I bought my first guitar I wouldn't have picked up an amp (it's just been collecting dust while I use my GuitarPort). The sound is superb. It's very rich and sounds like it was recorded in a studio.Set up of the GuitarPort was very simple and I was playing in about 5 minutes!One important thing to note is that you cannot record with the software provided with the GuitarPort. But not to worry! Once you have the GuitarPort software installed you can go to the Line 6 website and download their RiffTracker software to record all the music you can make. One nice thing about the RiffTracker is the InstantDrummer feature which allows you to set the tempo and variation for different types of drums and match it with your style of play on the guitar. And the drums sound great!GuitarPort($99) + RiffTracker Recording software($99) = Equals the perfect way to record your own music on the cheap!

89914,1,I purchased this software because it had the formats required by the professional printers I use. I have been even more pleased with how easy it is to use this program. It is much like the program by Microsoft I was accustom to working. Within one hour of starting this program I had a professional design laid out for my client ready to go to the printer. It is much more user-friendly than Corel Draw 12 or Adobe products. I am very pleased with my purchase. I would definitely recomment this product.
25179,1,I was already impressed with the previous version. This later version of VS.NET is more reliable and installs without having to install the previous version first. You will still need VS.NET 2002 disk 1 to completely install this upgrade.

73123,1,"This is the multi-million selling action driving crime game Grand Theft Auto Vice City. Most noticeably it takes place in the 1980s, which means all of the excess, jokes and music of that era are here and it makes for a rich atmosphere that other games can't hold a candle to.As mentioned before this is an action driving crime game. It is meant for a mature audience, because right off the bat, the game's protagonist Tommy Vercetti finds himself on the wrong end of a drug deal gone bad and to appease his bosses back in Liberty City he needs to get back the drugs, the fifty grand and make those pay who took the money. That means Tommy must take on missions given by great personalities voiced by some famous people like Dennis Hopper, Gary Busey, Laurence Taylor and even Tommy himself is voiced by Ray Liotta.The main missions are fun and diverse. It stars simple like driving somewhere, picking someone up and escorting them and it goes to the complex such as stealing a cop car, uniform and destroying stores in the local mall. Vice City is a great big place and you'll need to drive to get anywhere. The game offers a wide array of cars, bikes, motorcycles, planes, helicopters and boats to get where you want to go and do missions with. The game handles easy and simple, one button for forward, one for reverse. Certain vehicles let you take on side missions like vigilante where you are a cop going after cooks to kill them, a firefighter that has you water blasting out car fires, a taxi driver, and a pizza delivery boy. Each side mission gets you more cash and has a great prize for each if you can do several rounds of the side mission without running out of time. There are nice jumps that will score you cash, races, drive bys and car chases. It is some amazing fun.When you're on foot you can run, jump, auto aim your gun and shoot. The auto aim is a lifesaver and there are a diverse array of shotguns, pistols, machine guns and melee weapons like cleavers, swords, bats, hammers and golf clubs. Combat is fun and I've watched several friends beat down people just to do it.The controls for the PC take some getting used to and its best if you use a controller and set it up like the PS2 controls (its impossible to set it up like X-Box controls). But the PC does make use of a mouse look system and click to shoot if you would like. It makes gunning more difficult because then you do not auto aim. There is no real graphics upgrade for the PC. It seems on par with Playstation 2 and not X-Box. If anything you can make the draw distance very far.The game is full of rich characters, but it also has pedestrians, street walkers, gangs and feels full of life. Gangs will chase one another and war over turf... while you watch. Cops will chase bad guys, pedestrians will jump out of the way of your speeding car. Street walkers will walk up to your car. People will talk to one another on the street. It is nice to just sit back and watch it all.Since you are a criminal, part of the random fun that comes from the game is getting the police after you with your wanted level. One star and you can be good and the heat will go away. Two stars and you will need to either get your vehicle spray painted or find stars that will make your wanted level go down. Three stars and the police will use spike strips and send undercover cars after you. The more you're wanted, the bigger force will be out to stop you. Eventually tanks and helicopters will be after you. This adds some extra fun and excitement to ordinary missions or just normal pay.As mentioned before, the game has a rich atmosphere. The atmosphere is more than just the 80s rap, new wave, 80s pop and televangelists on the radio. The cars look slick under the bright neon lights of a Floridian city. Rain effects and streaming tail lights add to an incredible look. Even if there wasn't this environment, the game would be a lot of fun because of the mechanics.The game doesn't just stop once you've achieved what you think is your goal in the game. It continues on as you grow a criminal empire by purchasing businesses and residences to use as safe house save points.In conclusion, you can spend 300+ hours just messing around in this sandbox world, discovering side missions and quirky things here and there. It is a fun game that has been around for nearly a decade. The hours you play the game will just fly buy as you drive, explore, gun down and chase anything you want."
66880,1,"We LOVE this game at our house! I bought it for my son who is just over 4 years old. We just fixed up an old laptop for him to get him off the Wii and TV and get him some experience on a computer. The graphics are SUPER CUTE, like my title says, it looks like you are controlling the car in a cute cartoon! You can create multiple profiles, with a license plate with the child's name and play as one of 4 vehicles, the police car, fire engine, tow truck or dump truck. You get to drive all around, using the mouse, and visit all the town's sights to complete tasks. The tasks are easy enough to prevent frustration, but not too easy for a little guy. You get certificates for finishing the missions. I am very happy I invested $10 in this game, as we have been having a hard time finding games that have good graphics and easy but fun games for pre-schoolers. We would definitely recommend this one."
12489,1,"My new Dell, 8200, desktop came pre-installed with XP, and after using it for a half a month it has been very, very stable and the look of the operating system is really great. The OS can be in your face at times, but you can change the way everything looks and make many things nonexistent so you never see them.The OS starts really fast, and I have not seen the dreaded blue screen at all. Also, my application opening times have much faster than with Windows98 or Windows Me.After getting the feel of the OS I decided to upgrade my, Dell, laptop, which was running Windows Me. The upgrade went very, very smooth, and I did not have any trouble during the install. After having the new OS on my laptop just for a few days I have not seen the constant Windows Me crash, and my laptop starts faster, my applications run quicker, and my computer looks really cool with XP on it. The only draw back that I have noticed with XP on my laptop is that it really uses a lot more memory usage than Windows Me. If you have only 64MB on your laptop, which is what I have, I would suggest upgrading your memory before or after you upgrade.In conclusion, I would really suggest buying Windows XP because it really is Microsoft's best home version of Windows yet, and it is a really solid product."

86738,2,"I bought Xilisoft's DVD Ripper 5 and it worked great for a few months. But then, I went in one day and found that the program had been ""upgraded"" to a trial version of 6. This meant that I was back to only being able to rip 5 minutes worth of a DVD. If I wanted to rip longer portions, I was going to have to pay the full price. AGAIN. And it wouldn't allow me to go back to the version I had actually paid for which did all I wanted it to do. Now, I have a useless program and a company I will not use again."
47952,1,"This is very cool! So much better than the old Catz 3! You now have voice recignition so you can speak to your Catz! You also can travel to places around the world - Arabia, Gypsy Circus, Canadian Snow Scene, South Seas Island, and Wild West! Plus, you can create your own playscenes with the playscene editor! Freezes sometimes when starting, but easy to fix! It has also tonz of new toyz and clothez! You have another problem to deal with, too - your petz can get sick!Overall, I give this program two pawz up!"
2584,1,"This Program is great for any child who has a love for music! The simple icons, and easy intructions make it easy for anyone to create their own music! You can add instuments, Sound effects, your own voice, or something pre-recorded. They have many choices of instuments, and patterns so you will never get bored! I got the program from my brother, and when I saw the ages 6-10 on the box, I was like oh yeah, this will be a lot of fun...but I was wrong! I am 15 and I LOVE this program! Sonic Foundry does it again! I love those guys!"
60017,1,"I don't need to say anything about Powerpoint.This is a must-have for anyone who works with slideware.I bought the mini Office 2003 because I only needed Wordfrom it, and bought PP separate, and saved about $100.The install went perfect. I installed PP from Office 2000first, but I don't think you need to do that. I think the upgrade will work if it finds any Office 2000 or Office 2003 programs."

31186,1,"Current users of OS X should be aware that this is the version for people who don't yet have OS X at all. Make sure you go to apple.com for the appropriate redemption forms. Apple is offering an upgrade to OS X.1 at a substantially reduced price over what's shown here.Still, it's ridiculous that Apple is charging current users anything for the upgrade. This upgrade comes mere months after the original release. It should be offered as a free download, as well as being available on CD-ROM.I'm sure, however, that the upgrade will dramatically improve the OS. There were many peripheral and Classic compatibility issues that needed resolution to bring this great OS even greater utility. But OS X.1 goes dramatically beyond this, offering faster speeds and, in some cases, stunning convenience right from the desktop. It's clearly a must-buy. It's just a shame that you have to actually buy it."
16969,1,"Agreed, this version of Norton has fewer utilites than the previous incarnation. However, if you own a Windows XP machine, this is a MUST. It has an excellent disk defragger and scandisk (both things Windows has notoriously lacked). It also has WinDoctor, which fixes all those broken shortcuts &amp; incorrect entries in system files that make programs crash after you've moved things around. Norton also seems to have fixed its AntiVirus program's problem with interfering with other PC functions."
32008,1,"I upgraded from the Spyder2Express, not really an upgrade because its cheaper to just purchase the pro version than it is to get the upgrade, which means I ended up with a spare device.On my mac the dual screen supports just works, I use a single card with two outputs and it does support two profiles at the same time. Worked first time, but Mac dual screen support is much better than Windows.I also calibrated my Windows systems and my laptop with no issues.Makes the complex task of calibrating your screens pretty simple.One point to highlight before you start though and this applies to ANY product of this type.You simply MUST try to learn what you are attempting to do BEFORE starting any calibration process. If you do not know what the device is trying to do, then you will have problems. Color management is a complex process, expecting this device to simplify it while ignoring all the other aspects of a color managed workflow is a recipe for failure.This applies to Gretag and the others as well."
50288,1,"My Powerbook G4 had been getting slow and hard to use. I was getting the ""beach ball"" just about every time I tried to do anything. I installed Leopard last night and it is like a whole new computer! It is so much faster!Also, I had accidentally deleted the Mail app in Tiger. With Leopard I got all the new and updated apps (Mail, Calendar, Address Book, DVD Player, etc.).I have nothing but great things to say about Leopard.I had been concerned that my Powerbook G4 would not be able to handle it, but had a friend who had been able to install it on her 4 year old iBook, so I figured if it worked on there, it would be great on my PowerBook G4.If you are thinking about getting Leopard, do it. I cannot afford a whole new computer right now, but this is pretty close."
29362,1,"In The Haunted Carousel, Nancy is visiting a theme park to solve the mystery of why the rides are acting very strange. The roller coaster suddenly stopped, and in the middle of the night, the carousel starts turning by itself. Nancy Drew comes to Captain's Cove amusement park when it is shut down. However, people are still working there, and Nancy is quick to meet these people and figure out their motives for possible sabotage.This game was the first Nancy Drew computer game I played (I have now played seven, and I will be starting a new one as soon as possible.) This is probably one of the more scary ones out of the ones I have played. The Haunted House is even scarier than the person in the salt water taffy shop inNancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon!Even though it is pretty scary, it is also entertaining. There are puzzles, games and absolute oddities (the robot thing is definitly included). The ending is very exiting, and it really surprised me. (Now I know how to spot possible culprits early on. It won't surprise more experienced players, but it is really a quite good game. It is one of the simpler games. If you are looking for a more challenging game, I suggest you tryNancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand. The Haunted Carousel is definitly not very long compared to the other games, but is just as entertaining."
6635,0,"There's something good happening at Microsoft (believe it or not): The Mac unit there seems to function very well. Probably because it's a small, self-contained mini-organization that is not particularly beholden to the Gates machine. Whatever the reason, Office 2004 for Mac is better than the Windows version. It's more stable, far less prone to attack (and therefore more secure), and it is far more versatile visually than its XP counterpart. Word is the star of this show, with its improved formatting palettes and its notebook feature. You can right-click on a graphic within a document and save it as a png or jpg (you can't do that on Word for Windows); and of course, thanks to the Mac interface, you can turn any doc into a pdf through the print menu (this still can't be done in XP, though it may become possible in Vista, though that isn't clear yet, with the legal struggle between MS and Adobe ongoing).Weaknesses: as always with MS products, your trade-off for robust features is that the product is a memory hog. Have a machine with (preferably) 1GB or more of RAM and a G4, G5, or Intel processor to get the most out of this product, and little of the hassles. I haven't extensively used Entourage, the email client, because after a brief tour of it, I decided I was satisfied with Apple Mail, and Entourage had nothing significant to offer me. I don't do IM, so I don't know a thing about the IM client here. But Excel is very solid on the Mac platform, and Powerpoint is also fairly easy to work with, though I still prefer Apple's Keynote for presentation software.If you need MS Office capability on your Mac, this is a good product to have, but get the Student and Teacher's edition and save a lot of money. I've written several books in MS Word for Mac, and it has performed very well with them on a G4 machine with 768MB of RAM. But if your hardware is older or your budget's tight, look into Google's free Googledocs, which incorporates Google spreadsheet and the Writely word processor. You'll need a broadband connection for that to work well, but if you do it's a great alternative to the MS product."
80679,1,"iWork is a joy to use. It's simple and elegant. Numbers actually makes spreadsheets fun. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of Microsoft Office, but it also lacks the headaches and big price tag. I can easily share with my Office-using colleagues. iWork has read every Word, Excel and PowerPoint file I've received so far, and I can export my iWork files to those formats and a few others when I send files the other way."
53421,0,"MyVoice is pretty good at fading the voice part out on about half the songs I have tried - does particularly good with numbers like ""Hero"" by Enrique Iglesias and ""Masterpiece"" by Atlantic Starr. But i wasn't expecting it to work across the board. Users should note that some of the functions (such as playback of ripped tracks or MP3s) doesn't work under the newer version of Windows (not even talking about Windows 7), and appears to need a ""DirectX upgrade"", which still doesn't help. Anyhow, my older PCs can handle it, but the ripped versions of tracks with voice faded out are far worse than the real time output from a CD - perhaps I need to play with it some more. Overall, a fun complement to a full karaoke system - but still pretty much a toy and not a serious tool. Haven't tried the mixer part though."

77419,1,"Dragon NaturallySpeaking is the best voice recognition software available -- I don't think there's any real argument with that statement.HOWEVER...If you're already running DNS and are planning on upgrading your computer's operating system to Vista (or just planning on buying a new machine,) you need to be aware that DNS will not run on a 64-bit operating system. The manufacturer of the software, Nuance, has not announced any plans to release a 64-bit version, and are not committing to doing so with their next version. So you'll want to make sure you're staying with a 32-bit version of Windows Vista, otherwise you're SOL."
66167,1,"As a user of Norton/Symantec products for the last 10 years it was difficult to make the change, but I finally got fed up with the unintuitive bloated Norton resource hog and made the switch to the Zone Labs ZoneAlarm Security Suite. So far, I am very pleased with my purchase. I feel like I am back in charge of my firewall, and my PC is running more nimbly these days with 5 fewer processes running in the background.There is very little I can add to the excellent review by Amazon user Matthew Morgan as I agree in general with his assessment of the ZSS strengths and weaknesses. I bought it primarily as a firewall and anti-virus solution, and this is where the real strengths of the product lie. The firewall is very customizible, yet can be simplified enough that my un-tech wife can administer it when the need arises. I especially have confidence in the virus scanner after it picked up a trojan on its first scan that Norton had missed weekly for months.Sure ad and pop up blocking could be better but I use Firefox with its integrated pop up blocker, and coupled with Firefox's excellent and free Adblock extension I don't need any help in this area. Similarly I already rely on the integrated spam blocking in Firefox's companion email client Thunderbird, so any ZSS weaknesses in this area are not an issue for me either. If you are serious about stopping popups and blocking ads start by ditching Internet Explorer and Outlook/Express, then you will have less of a need for these kinds of features yourself.Lastly, I would like to respond to another reviewer's recommendation of using a router firewall in place of this kind of client based software firewall. You absolutely should use a router with a firewall enabled, but that is only half the battle as it will only give you inbound protection from port-scanning script kiddies. A router NAT firewall does NOTHING to protect you from Trojans you invite onto your machine via emails and downloaded files you execute, nor will it stop these Trojans from masquarading as legit programs with unlimited outbound access. So yes, use your router firewall, but ALWAYS in conjuction with a good software based firewall on all your clients. A good software based firewall like Zone Labs ZoneAlarm Security Suite!"
22724,1,Before I purchased this program I had a few questions about it. I called Creative Home's technical support line. A friendly and patient young man answered all my questions. I was very glad that I could use the data in my older event planner in the new version.I love the new version of Card Studio that I recently received in the mail. I think it is a great step forward for this line of software. I would recommend this version above all previous release. Hope you have some fun with it!!

30216,2,"Do not buy. It crashed several times on a plain Dell 8600. Very hard to use, like for example to set up rooms, because (1) there are no anchor points; should be able to anchor a corner and then drag a corner; (2) we cannot lock a room in place; while editing a room, another room resized; (3) there is no alignment among rooms; rooms should align sometimes, because they may share a common wall; (4) while working with a room, we cannot specify the type of wall; and so on. It has some sexy colors and menus, but after trying to use it for several times and coming out with no results, the next step is 'uninstall'."
54365,0,"This hang happened everytime I tried to install the program. I went to Taxcut.com for customer support and they had a link that said the problem was with fonts used on the program. They gave me a patch that did nothing. The problem still happened. So I read the reviews on this site and one person had the very correct idea of installing or updating your shock wave flash player. After thinking about it, this made perfect sense, look at the extension that hangs: swf. This worked perfectly. Thank you to that person. But why on earth would taxcut try to give people a font patch that doesn't even solve the real problem. Don't bother with that patch and just update your flash player."
90984,1,"I bought this and I think it is a very good game but, I can not really continue the game because I lose money trying to get some by doing the 5 things. I am going to keep on trying to finish the game. If you are really good at solving games and love horse I would get this game. And anyone can try it and if you keep on trying it you can win the game."
12003,1,"Windows XP is by far the best Windows operating system to date. This OS is wonderful! It does so many different things, and the best part is that it doesn't crash! I've had a lot of programs lock up, and they are easily shut down in less than 5 seconds. The best part is, that Microsoft took out the infamous &quot;Blue Screen of Death&quot; it's gone now! The best part is that it comes with a lot of built in features that are like a lot of Norton Utilities. The great thing about this version is the fact that you don't have that stupid Microsoft activation code, so that you can install it on many different computers!"
33917,1,"Apparently a lot of folks have had terrible problems installing running this software. Frankly, I think it's a little unfair to give a 1-star review to something if you didn't even get to try it. Just return the stuff try something else.Anyway, I'm running a standard Windows XP sp2 setup on two different computers - a Toshiba and an HP - and the software works fine on both of my machines. Tried putting it on a friend's Compaq with Windows Me and it also works fine. Not sure why so many people are having trouble with this. I mean, granted, it is old, but still...Anyway, onto the software: All in all, it's great stuff. It contains the authentic version of a lot of exercises that have been utterly mimicked, or poorly copied, by newer software such as Tell Me More! and Transparent Language's stuff (although I still like Transparent's software).A lot of activities, lots of vocab, listening exercises, etc. Very diverse, keeps your attention - unlike SOME programs out there (ahem, Auralog's Tell Me More series).All in all, an excellent buy for the money, but... I guess beware because a lot of people can't get it to install properly."
30350,1,"This collection of several games for young kids is entertaining and well designed for the most part. An added bonus is being rewarded with clips from the movie as you advance! Finally, kids software that is Mac OS X native. The games themselves are not bad -- the shell game (three shells get moved around, one with a fish under it; you guess which one has the fish), matching game, and ""shark pong"" game are well done. The turtle race and fish swim race are kind of weak. There's also a music band section that unfortunately is not very intuitive as to how to play around with the music. But, overall, a good value and fun for young kids!"

Non-topographic information, like trails and streams are not well updated and not detailed enough to be really useful. These remarks are relative to use with a Garmin nuvi 255W. I don't know how it would work installed on a GPS designed specifically for off-road use."

Every time I open up my file, my PC will automatically open it in Office 2007 and requests me to purchase it otherwise I can not modify my file. Office 2007 seems like stealthly get into my PC without my permission. I am very happy with Office 2003 and really want to get rid of the Office 2007 from my PC."
30218,1,This is a dream piece of software. If an administrator has users that want to backup thier software and yet keep the amount of network traffic down (i.e. over the Internet) this software is the answer. I have seen 30 meg files that would normally have to be completely uploaded every day because the user is constantly using them only take about 5 seconds... over the Internet. This software goes down to the binary level and takes only what changed in the software and adds that to the file on the server. Great software!! I highly recommend it.

I love the special effects even though we didn't get to experience the true 3-D because of our computer settings. The Help file was easy to understand and correct the problem to make the game usable though. The program was easy to navigate, although we did have to read the walkthroughs a few times when we couldn't figure out what to do next. The kids LOVE it and spend hours on it. I love the fact that it was a bundle with great games. The only one we haven't tried is the phonic's quest one. I've been putting a new one in every few weeks since her birthday and it's a whole new experience. She LOVES the cartoon maker one and she and my son both love the Brother bear adventure and the Mickey Saves the Day. I'd like to get some more of these software bundles in the future. The ages stated by the manufacturer seem to be appropriate. I have a bright 1st grader and a 4 yr kindergartener..

When we upgraded our Laptop to one that had Windows 7, I was concerned about compatibility issues. I ordered it anyway and it arrived several days earlier than was promised (we like that ;-). It had a note on the side of the box that told how to install with Windows 7. Followed the instructuon on the note and it installed without any problems (a big suprise these days). Amy Pro has always impressed me as a great user friendly Word Processor. Lotus 123 is like Excell without the buggs and quirks. Approach works well as a Data Base manager. All this with efficent code, you gotta love it!"
6049,1,"I have long been a McAfee advocate, often shunning Norton because it once interfered with the sound on my machine - but Internet Security 2002 has made me a believer. I bought the download and within 20 minutes, I was installing it on my machine. The set-up was step-by-step and very comprehensive - although for those who don't know a lot about what sort of preferences to set up on a firewall, I suggest getting some reference material. The firewall is incredibly detailed, allowing me to totally configure my machine to work within my home network while preventing outsiders from getting in. The Symantec site also has a place to check the security of your system and tells you how to fix your vulnerabilities. I had a copy of McAfee firewall/virus scan and am currently throwing it out - Norton Internet Security is a MUCH better tool - even the user interface is very friendly and useful."

After using the trial version of 2007, I was pleasantly incorrect. .Microsoft Office Professional 2007 FULL VERSIONDon't get me wrong I'm a long way from the aforementioned comfort level, but it will come with time. As with (in my opinion) most MS program of yore, 2007 has help and community support programs that one could spend hours upon hours reading until you forget the subject of the original question. As I used 2007, I realized that there are many ways to learn how to use the program, and the more I used it, the program adapted to MY LEARNING METHOD! If this teaching tool existed in my XP program, I missed it! For example, after I designed a few work sheets in Excel 2007, the program has learned that I make Headers and Footers by typing them in the original document, so it stopped ""asking"" if I wanted to use the tool. Perhaps this is inconsequential to most users, but I am really impressed!As a final note, I'm using Office Pro 2007 with Windows 2007 Ultimate (which I also recommend).Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate"

Some kids don't require pictures or ""fuff"" to learn.I'm looking forward to buying other languages from this company! You can actually participate in conversions.I do have to say, though, it does take a little time to figure out where to start in the program. BUT you must read the help section! It really... helps. :) Once you understand how to work the program... it's great!"

Everything seems to be more seamlessly integrated. It was so easy to set up, a couple of software configuration problems but... I've always hated the ""power and dominance of Microsoft."" But XP makes your computer run so much better, better file management, better media play, much more stable (havent crashed it since!) If you have bought a new computer recently but before XP came out, please buy this. If you like to have the best of the best, like to be organized, and use your computer often, this is a no-brainer buy."

After doing all the confirmations requested, trying repeatedly for over a week to check for updates, and then uninstalling the software and reinstalling it, I still got the same error message.

59021,1,"I have been using Microsoft Money since about 1996. I upgraded to 2002 in the beginning of 2002. I am amazed at what this program can do. It is such a time-saver. I am using the background banking. Even when Money is closed it automatically pulls in my transactions for my credit card and broker account.I was delinquent in reconciling my checking by 5 months. After I imported the transactions (took about 2 minutes), I was able to reconcile all 5 months in about 2 minutes flat. Somehow, it seemed to know which transactions to associate with the month I was reconciling. The hard part was finding my statements to balance to. If only my credit union would sign up for the direct banking so that I could use background banking.I love the ease of using the reports. They are easily customizable. Also, if you want to see the transactions behind a certain category you can right mouse click to see the detail.I cannot understand why so many people are unsatisfied with this product. I find it an intuitive program that contains a powerhorse of tools. It seems like I am constantly discovering new things it can do."

I wanted/needed the Outlook mail and calendar functions I've grown to love while working in the corporate environment. I've tried a number of email clients, some with calendar features, and none of them 'floated my boat'. When I found that MS made a personal Outlook client that was well within my budget I gave it a go, even after reading the reviews at Amazon.What I DIDN'T DO was install the extra Instant Search features (and other junk) and Outlook works quickly and does exactly what I need it to do; operate as an email client and work as a calender reminder! I currently have 6 different email clients and haven't had any issues (except when I forget to shut it down during the day and can't receive personal emails at work. LOL!!) I highly recommend this package as it also allows up to three clients in you home so it's a real bargain IMHO!"

84325,1,"From the reviews I have read so far from people bashing this OS, it really makes me wonder whether or not anyone actually downloaded a free tool from Microsoft's site called ""Vista Upgrade Advisor."" Just because you might think that your system is high-end, it doesn't necessarily means its Vista-Ready yet. This is the first tool anyone should run before buying Vista. After the scan, it tells you whether or not your PC can handle Vista. Furthermore, it even recommends which version(Basic, Premium, Business or Ultimate) to use.Apart from that, it seems that Vista focuses too much on eye candy this time around. Although you have to admit: the whole look is eye-catching.However, as I am writing this, its been only a month since Vista hit the shelves, so its still not the most stable software in the world(and boy, do I ever use that term loosely here,) but with time it will be. Let's not forget XP and their constant upgrades -- Vista will always have updates as well. As of right now, it is very raw and if you have patience, you should wait until the dust clears and the price lowers in the upcoming months. However, if you have a new PC and deciding between XP and Vista, definitely get Vista and get a head start by learning it's features.Bottom Line: Download Vista Upgrade Advisor before even having thoughts of getting Vista. Just think of it as a ""test-drive"" without the driving."

Although it's pretty easy to get along in English, I wanted to grasp at least a little bit of one of the main languages from India. The Rosetta Stone course Hindi did the trick for me. It's fun, it's easy, it's fast. Without one word of help in an other language, this visual and interactive program whisks you through the basics in no time. My Indian friends loved it. Because of the alphabet being different from ours, there are no writing excercises available. It would help if at least a overview of the Hindi Alphabet and a sound description was added to the course. But still I can't wait for a complete 92-lessons-course to become available."

72573,1,"How can you not love a tool that lets you revert back to BEFORE mistakes were made? I was at first skeptical of this software, it just sounds too good to be true, and it seemed to be too easy of an answer to my prayers. Several times I have fallen victim to circumstance (or my own mistakes) and have lost incredibly important data. After several factory restores and heartache and frustration over lost critical and important files, I decided to invest....it's the smartest purchase I've ever made for my computer. With Roxio your pictures, data, email etc are guaranteed safe despite viruses, user error, installation errors or just unknown glitches we've ALL been victim of. I sleep well at night knowing my computer is 100% safe...just as important as firewall and virus scan software. I use the downloaded version to save $10...4 months later I can say this is probably the best utility for my computer I have ever purchased. I'm recommending this software to all my family and friends. It's the best 40 bucks I've ever spent."

Well, the kids, then 5 and 3, loved it and within a month I bought the additional units. Once my Kindergartener finished all the units I called to buy the 1st grade units and found the Jump Start World Club and we joined. I was able to download directly to the PC, no more disks to deal with. I received the pre-school (3-5), 1st Grade (5-7) and 2nd grade (6-8) all for one price. My now 4 year old who was taking her time through the Kindergarten program, finished the pre-school program in two months and had a new interest in the kindergarten program. My now 1st grader is more than half way through the 1st grade program and they play in their Worlds almost every day. My 1st grader tells regularly when we are working on schoolwork, ""I did that in Jump Start World!"" and Zips through her assignments. Now my sisters have gotten into the program for their kids. My whole family completely enjoys this product and I believe it is worth every dime I spent on it."

The map worked pretty good on our GPS (Nuvi 260).We preset all our reserved hotels and places we plan to go (into favorites) before leaving the country, so it is really convenient. We booked a B & B in a small town on a hill near Interlaken where even Google map doesn't show, but it can be found on this map. We drove there without any problems (some other people we talked had to make a lots of phone calls to find the place). In another case, the gas tank was low, but the road signs don't show any gas stations nearby, we used the map to find a Shell station (and WC) in a small town. Some roads have complicate intersections which are hard to figure out which exit to take, especially at night. With the map, there is no need to worry about making a mistake in driving. The GPS can guide you.In all, we are pleased with the product."

This is made clear in the introductory video.The game offers training missions and actual missions. In the training missions, the player is trained for the basic activities.Much of this game is making tradeoffs with time and resources. For example, you need a fixed number of engergy crystals to complete a level. You can use some of them to obtain drilling vehicles, or special buildings to supply air and food, or help locate crystalls. Rock Raider can hold a fixed number of tools. You can have some of them carry weapons to defend you mining base, but then they can't hold as many tools.This is an interesting game that gets increasingly challenging and makes you think at times."

22379,0,"At the outset, I do agree that this game crashes right upon startup, however, it does so only when you have unsupported video cards - and the Read Me suggests that it won't work with onboard/integrated cards. Don't know the veracity of the last claim.I experienced this pain when I used it on a hand me down system - P4 2.8 w/some integrated video chip. Then I acquired a decent system that supports ATI X1650 PRO PCI-E, and lo and behold the game worked fine, except...There is an instance when it fails repeatedly (almost always - there are rare occasions when the system plays), and here is when it happens on my system: Arcade -> Piston Cup -> Palm Mile Speedway. There may or may not be more code paths which cause the system to report ""Stop Error."" My opinion is based on a day's worth of usage."

If you let your kids run your computer as an administrator, it is a fun game, though."
73351,0,"I've been using a number of different language software programs as research for a thesis. I've enjoyed using the Rosetta Stone software to study German, Arabic and Japanese. I have lived in Japan and I had studied Japanese for a number of years before I came across this software. It was my first time studying German and Arabic.My biggest problem with Rosetta Stone software comes from the complete lack of any explanation of the basics of the target language. The theory here is that you will learn the language as a child does by seeing pictures, hearing the words and making the connection. This idea in practice can be a lot of fun and you should be able to pick up some vocabulary and sentence structures in a very short time (as long as the language uses an English alphabet). However, without a few basic pointers on the writing systems of languages like Japanese and Arabic, good luck figuring anything out. For example, if you did not know that Arabic is written and read from right to left with the letters joined together as in cursive English, you stand little hope of ever being able to break words and phrases down into the 28 Arabic alphabet's characters. It wasn't until I went to another source outside the Rosetta Stone software that I realised my massive error in trying to decipher the most basic script. This could have easily been avoided had the software offered a few pages of explanation, or even just the alphabet itself spelled out with English letter approximate equivalents and an arrow pointing from right to left. And Japanese? The same problem times 3 (the number of written character styles in Japanese) and just as confusing.Final review then? The Rosetta Stone software by itself can be quite useful as long as you are after listening and speaking skills only AND you don't think you'll ever need to see and read the word as you hear it. However, if you were hoping to learn reading and writing in a target language that uses a writing system other than the English alphabet, be prepared to go hunting for additional resources as a primer before you start banging your head against this Stone. After an hour or so of basic tutorial from an Arabic alphabet website, I got back on track with Rosetta, but I was quite annoyed that I ever had to make that extra journey in the first place. A company should not try to claim that its software is an all encompassing program if it falls so far short of just that from the get go."

The graphics are exceptional, and the gameplay is downright addicting. After what seemed like half an hour, it was already 1 A.M. The game is so much more than just chomping ghosts, there are snakes, boulders, alligators, etc. There are also tons of thrilling mini-games that kept me excited for hours. While some mazes were frustrating, others were rather easy. This game is worth the [price]any day. I have not encountered any glitches yet, on my Compaq Pentium 2. My only complaint is that you may encounter lack of eating, obsessiveness with the game and sore fingers because of overplaying."
91448,0,"I bought this in part just to have the 1960s and 1990s issues since I have a good run of X-Men collected from about 1976 through to about 1987 starting with Giant Size No. 1, in fact this dvd cost me roughly the same as my copy of that comic book, which i bought sometime in 1980.I have a nice new 24"" iMac so the double page spreads of pdf files look gorgeous. You have to use the Adobe Reader or else a Marvel watermark appears, but Adobe Reader is of course free to download so only a minor hassle for those who normally use Apple's Preview for pdf files.The interface is not the most elegant of designs and is a very simple pdf file with a set of hyperlinks. I have seen some of the various shareware programs for reading scanned comic books and those interfaces are more appealing and user friendly. But most people shopping here at Amazon probably are interested like me in getting a legal copy and not a torrent so the issue may be moot.The dvd includes a bio section but this is slow to load off the dvd and is not much faster when copied to the Mac. I have a 2.8GHz processor. I put it in my PC laptop with a 1.73GHZ processor and oh my was it slow. How useful this section is given that the information is available on the web is debatable. The comics though load much faster than the bio and sometimes a bit to fast so I have to be very careful when paging through.So if you want to read and enjoy old X-Men it may be better to buy the bricks available. For me I wanted a reference collection that will not take up space. Its ok and does the job I need."
23658,0,"The one I have is very old. The sounds are great, but the program is difficult to use. You can't just click on a sound, then insert it into the work you're creating. Maybe it's been updated, I don't know, but it needs to be easier to use. I'd buy a new one if it were."
19243,0,"My child loves to play with this program, and therein lies the problem. Though at 5 she is at the minimum age for the software, I cannot help but feel that the program could go a bit deeper than the sound-bite descriptions to perhaps a more conceptual level, such as introducing basic notions of evolution or even geologic time. Is this too ambitious? Perhaps, but the way the program works, it is just like entering a cartoon and, as a learning experinece, little better than watching TV."
85411,1,"After much effort, our friends at Alfred not only got the program running properly, but convinced me that they are concerned about customer service.An excellent piece of software, and a serious custoemr support group. A usefule and well thought out program as well."
26097,1,"Got this product in December and have only had a few minor problems. Backed up 45 of my dvds with only 1 disk being bad. (for some reason it decided to finalize the whole cd) But 45 out of my 46 attempts to back up my dvds were successful.My computer is a 2Ghz/512 RAM/ and Sony-510A dvd-burner. But I've heard that this software is not compatible with everything.The program first reads the dvd which takes anywhere from 22 to 47 minutes. Then insert blank dvd and it'll write it in no time. The 'backup' dvd is very good quality, hard to notice the difference."
83628,1,"I was excited when I saw this collection on sale. I remembered pouring over my father's collection that took up a large part of a bookshelf, but only represented a few years of the magazine's history. Now here was a more-or-less complete collection (every issue to the end of 1998) that only took up minimal shelf space.The only bad thing that can be said about this package is that, as noted below, the picture quality is at times annoying. (I recommend viewing it at smaller than 800x600.) Basically, in order to see the photos at their best, the darkness option at the bottom of the screen must be slid all the way to the lightest setting (then it looks excellent), but then to set the text at its most visible, it has to be slid back to the darkest or next to darkest setting (and even then, it can look slightly smudged). Unless you read first, then look at the photos afterwards, you have to keep switching back and forth. Also, when the text is on a non-white background, as for text accompanying diagrams and charts, it is a strain to read. But even then, it is not difficult to read most of the text, and this is still a worthwhile package. After all, you get an (almost) complete collection of the wonderful photographs and fun, educational essays that is National Geographic Magazine (note: you do miss out on things you can only get with the hardcopy like special scented features, holograms and 3D effects (buy the hardcopy if you need such gimmicks), and for the map inserts you need to purchase another cd-rom collection). Even the old ads are a hoot to look at, and the search engine is excellent. And sure, there are 30 cds to switch between, but imagine trying to track down an article amongst hundreds of magazines filling up a room instead.When you consider all of the text you get (110 years worth of magazines, many of which are extremely rare), the price is a great value. Knowing the excellent quality of the magazine, my one fear in laying out the large amount of money necessary for this collection was that say, in 5 years, it would be necessary to buy it again to get those newer issues on cd, but so far I have gotten an update cd that covers the year 1999 and hopefully more will be released.This excellent (though flawed) product is highly recommended."
93864,1,"And I really mean woooooooow.I absolutley love the My Scene girls and what is better than to see them in action!?Well nothing.I was very excited for the movie,and the game just made things a lot better.There are soooooo many cool things you can do.Finish off unfinished scripts by filling in empty spaces.You can pick your theme too,from being a spy,to going in space,to a sunny beach.There are some mini games,like guide a golf cart through out the studio to help Barbie deliver lunches.You can give the girls a head to toe makeover.Give them a completely different face feature by putting make up and change their hair etc.You can also dress two of the gils and get them ready.My computer is Windows XP,and the only flaw to this game is that it only works for Windows XP(as much as I've read).Prove me wrong,but other than that,this game is perfect.I got it the moment it got out and I'm still playing it and it hasn't gone boring.I say buy it.Oh and did I mention,there are short movies in between the levels(I don't know how to call them),and the graphics are sooooooooooooo good that you just want to watch it over and over agin."

20479,1,"My personal experience with this software is that it is very user friendly and versatile with regard to adding transitions, effects, and music tracks . The main recommendation, as you have probably heard before, is to make sure that you have adequate hard drive space (my 17 minute edited video took up 20 GB of hard drive space), so that you can capture your video in DV mode. If you do not have enough hard drive space available, you will have to capture video in another mode, and then, during the rendering process, have to reconnect your camcorder to the computer--the burning process takes hours. I personally have not experienced any of the bugs that the other reviewers mention with this software. I have edited and burned four home movies thus far without any problems."
6929,2,"Program was written by a real bone-head. Very incomplete listing of worldwide stamps. Missing subcatagories, saves imputed entries to wrong country-just a complete & utter mess. The deeper you get into the program the more obvious the ineptitude of the creator is revealed. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! As an UPDATE-upon the crash of my computer a few months ago I contacted Paul @ StampManager Customer Service for guidance as to re-installing the program (I originally purchased the ""download"" version-ANOTHER HUGE MISTAKE?). I'm still waiting for a response. I originally purchased the program to organize my deceased father's collection so I had back-up but needed the program. These circumstances forced me to re-purchase the DVD version of StampManger 2012. I now cannot upload my data to the newly installed version. Needless to say, my emails (no phone number & the live chat option for contact is a joke) have gone unanswered.DVD is going back-I'm looking for a new program to catalogue our stamp collection."
3778,1,This is very good. I edited many photos and video clips. Then I made cd disks with the program. No installation or freezing problem. I say to try it and no regret. I understand the menus and it was simple. Now I have many cds that I made.

Get Norton AntiVirus instead - easy to install and works like a charm."
41038,1,"I have two kids, 5 and 6, and had purchased one copy. They both loved it -- the 6 year old can do more of it by himself, but the 5 year old is getting it. The program offers a tangram kind of segment which allows the kids to manipulate geometric shapes, scales that want 3 addition problems solved simultaneously -- had to explain it on paper to the six year old and show him that it was addition they were doing to which he replied: 'oh, that's why they call it math quest."" They have word problems and the kids have to put gems on a plate (There are 10 gems all together. Six are purple. There are an equal number of blue and white gems.) My five year old can't read yet, so I have to stand by to help her with that. Not a lot of practice with simple math, which is what I expected, but enough stuff that I wasn't expecting to keep the kids challenged and having fun. Bottom line -- it got enough play that I bought a second copy so each computer would have one and they weren't competing for turns."
92536,1,"Yes that's right IF YOU HATE YOUR MOTHER IN LAW AND WANT TO DO HARMFUL THINGS TO HER THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU!!!!!I thought J.Lo's movie ""Enough"" had fighting and violence, this movie is just a battle royal between J.lo's and jane fonda's character.The Plot is charlie(jennier lopez) is getting married to jane fonda's character's son.But it's a pretty bad time to do so since she is a barbara walters type tv host and assaults a female pop singer on stage for being so ignorant plus she likes to hit the bottle.When J.F's character comes out of Rehab she finds out her son is getting married to charlie she doesnt like it. And she will risk going to jail to get her out of the picture.The way these two females duke it out throughout the movie and you see the ways they try to make each others life hell is entertaining alone.See poisoning attempts, expensive clothes destroyes, insults, and so many more entertaining scenes.I highly recommend this movie for a rental, and if you get alot of pleasure of seeing movies over and over again well then buy it.This is jennifer lopez's best movie(thats saying alot) and it shows jane fonda to a younger generation.Just please Dont try the stunts you see in this movie on your mother in law or daughter in law, you might go to jail!--The Opinionated One Has Spoken"
69344,0,"A user of Money 2001 I thought it was time for an upgrade. And while I liked many of the features and enchancements that this version brought, it also brought some issues that regretfully have not been resolved by Microsoft. The new ""simplified"" register is great, making entry easier. The fact that the software really works hard to integrate with the new web-based banking that is offered and tries to consolidate all those various accounts is a plus. Downsides are creating recuring Bills is now quite the chore. Also I encountered a problem after installation that the software wont update correctly. This is a major annoyance so after calling MS we still had no solution other than create a new account on the computer, install MS there, then use it under the primary account. I did the reverse of the solution which is to install it under my primary account and then just use a second account to do updates. I would give it 6.5 out of 10 for ease of use, then again its a big change from 2001 and I might get a handle on it later."
13,1,My four-year-old loved this CD. She played it over and over until she exhausted the CD about 10 times. She was able to play it by herself. It is cleverly designed with games that utilize a child's creativity. I highly recommend it for young girls.

60792,1,"Although it has taken some time to learn, this program will serve perfectly the purpose for which it was purchased. As a cyclist, I am always interested to track my routes. Now I can prove that outrageously steep climb to my buddies and regonize dangerous decents before I choose a route. It helps to know where you're going, and this program allows you to see where you are going... literally, if you download the free satellite imagery for a specific area. Well worth the money. It's even fun just to roam the the entire nation!"

86173,1,"I love this game! I had it when I was a child and its my favorite out of the all of the Oregon Trails. I feel like it gives the player the most control over the wagon party.My only issue is that it isn't compatible with the 64bit Windows.

The serial number was very clear and I had no problem with it. The third file that I tried to convert was also very big and complex and PowerPDF didn't convert it. I then went to the site to download the patch, but didn't find one. All these files were created with Microsoft Word 2000 and Microsoft Paint."

Fortunately last year when I purchased my MacBook Pro, and complained about Quicken, a senior Apple representative in the King of Prussia store suggested iBank! He was correct ~ iBank is simple to use, versatile with excellent, nearly instant, email support from real people! If you are a Mac user, I suggest you ignore any negative reviews, trash Quicken and purchase iBank."
70435,1,"I use this software in my school for a Video Production class. It is amazingly easy to use, yet creates amazingly complex and well made films. I wouldn't recommend trying to use it on an I-mac though. I would suggest using a G4 to properly use this software. There are a few minor faults in the editing area. For one thing it is almost impossible to input extra footage into an almost finished video. Nevertheless, it is a great program. The effects are amazing. If you don't have a digital camera to use with your computer you will need to get a VCR and a converter. If you have the cash to buy this software and have some fun with it I would definitely suggest getting it."

It is a preatty high price for just one contry, so will say you should expect a little more. And when I tryed to registrate, it come up with that the code has been registrate before. So did I buy a pirat Map card, or is that a Garmin problem??? I was in Mexico then, so I did not call and spenn a lot of money to figure this out."
64393,1,"You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it.I'm not going to criticize anyone except to say IF you have a question or problem, the ZA website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company's products. There are some compatibility probs for example with Yahoo Mail BETA. As soon as Yahoo finalizes it's mail server ZA will be compatible. Simply switch back to yahoo mail (pre beta). There are several other beta products but generally if you're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs. ZA REALLY is better at what it is suppose to do than other products ONCE you have learned how to use it. Kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar.I use the free stuff too, and recommend them for those who are on a budget - students, etc. but the ZA suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who can't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway. I know what you're thinking btw...but ask yourself ""Is your private information, time and computer worth it to you?"" If so go with Zone Alarm, learn how to use it and be safer on the net.John Rowin1ear"
51877,0,"My boss is really into technology, and he bought this and claims it's great, so he asked me to do up an organization chart in Visio (he's capable of doing it himself, but doesn't want to waste his time on things he can delegate, understandably).I'm pretty fast at working out how to use new programs, and, since this was a Microsoft one and I'm used to Office, I worked out quickly how to use it. However, I found it tedious to use, especially for such a simple chart. I ended up opening Word and just doing the chart up in there instead, since it was a lot faster.If you're doing up a lot of complex charts, then this sounds like the program for you. But if you're only doing up simple charts, stick with MS Word and don't spend your money on this. I know I won't be using it again."

38031,1,"Since video biterate and audio bitrate are the tough elements in the DVD copy precedure, DVDxp4 is a tool that can do them all if the player knows how to select the right force 24KHz in the input DVD source template. This force will adjust the stable clock cycle for each DVD source format, 4/3 or 16/9 for example. As a result, copying DVD movie to SVCD from a CD burner is the best process of DVDxp4. However, to play this SVCD the player needs to look for the right and new home DVD player. The new DVD Sumsung S221 I am using is a correct player that can go forward or reverse easily when playing this SVCD. The other DVD player may or may not read this SVCD format. PowerCDR Express is also a best tool because it forces to stop the process when encoutering a wrong code that is inserted onto the DVD source. This stop is a good precedure to save a CD-R. The player needs to change VBR and the length of movie on a CD-R to skip this wrong code when using this DVDxp4/PowerCDR."

545,1,"I was a bit apprehensive as it came time to renew my .Mac membership. The service had not had much of an overhaul since it debuted as a pay-for service 3 years ago. Anti-virus software and other free software downloads were no longer available, and the paltry 250MB of shared email and disk storage paled in comparison to most other free online services. But faced with the prospect of losing the email address that I'd been using for the past 5 years, as well as my entire network of uploaded photo pages, I seemed resigned to pay for the renewal.But last week, Apple came through again and upgraded the features of .Mac, making the upgrade more than worth it. For less than $80 a year for .Mac service here on Amazon, you now get 1GB of online storage to share between your email account and iDisk. But more importantly, Apple has dramatically increased the allowed monthly bandwidth to your .Mac photo and video pages, making it easier to share your memories with friends, family and colleagues without the worry of not being able to deliver all of that content.There's a new new version of Backup (version 3.0) which has a more intuitive interface for both novices and advances users. Reports say that performance has increased, but I have not had the chance to adequately test it in order to confirm that.Another feature of .Mac are Groups. You can create collaoration points with other .Mac members to share files and information, although all members of the group must belong to .Mac.For anyone who is using Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), I highly recommend .Mac. The integration into all of the Tiger applications (Mail, iCal, Address Book, iSync) is seamless and makes backing up and synchronizing your data so much easier. Photo publishing with iPhoto 5 is even easier now as well.Count me in for one more year of .Mac and I am looking forward to more improvements next year!"

73593,1,"I've studied four foreign languages in virtually every possible way of learning a language. Rosetta Stone's approach is a very nice combination of matching pictures with words in the language you're learning, with plain old (but very effective) brute repetition.Some helpful notes for people considering this software:If you simply hate repetition, you won't like this program. On the other hand, if you simply hate repetition, you will never learn a foreign language!If you buy the program from Amazon, you can't use the manufacturer's money-back guarantee. (I asked Amazon this, and that's what Amazon said.)The voice recognition component really does work, but only if you're patient and try out different things to figure out why your rating is low. I've think I've learned a number of things about pronunciation using it.A completely unexpected benefit of the software is that I have learned how to touch-type on the standard Cyrillic keyboard (no joke!) and before even finishing the first unit. And I'm getting faster. This is because one of the components of the program has you write out what you hear. So you learn spelling very well (easy to get wrong in Russian) too, because you transcribe what you hear and you are corrected immediately.Yes, it's probably overpriced, but it's totally different from a digitized version of a book, which is how some other language learning programs seem to me. It's more like a game, and a bit of an addictive game, too. So that's the other big advantage: if you find the method in general appealing, you might stick with it when you might not stick with other methods (but of course your mileage may vary)."

45726,1,"I would like to start off by saying that after using Mandrake &amp; Redhat for a little over 2 years (which i haven't used continuously but have installed it and messed around and now am a pro at installing) i finally got my hands on Suse Linux 9.0. I have wanted to try suse for a while but since they didn't have free distro it was hard finding ISO images. Just a week ago i installed it and let me tell you HONESTLY this is the best LINUX I HAVE EVER SEEN. The installation process is just amazing. Works flawlessly. Before i go further my advice to any newbies out there is DON'T EXPECT ur LINUX box to work as a WINDOWS box. I would recommend Linux to any person out there who wants to learn diff OS's for education purposes or fun purpose but don't expect to install linux and expect to play Need For Speed. You can however install it to just improve yourself in programming or Networking with other OS's and upgrade your skills since Linux is gaining a lot of rep and esp now that Suse has been bought out by Novell and its no surprise anymore to why Novell decided to go with Suse and not Redhat or anybody else. Linux right now is getting better better and better but still it has way to go. The appearance is just amazing you could say that its close to being somewhat Longhorn would look like. Extensible drivers and lil changes in how programs are named and all might make it more appealing and better for the Newbies. NTFS write permissions would be real good. My sound card worked fine everything was detected, Suse updated without any problems after install. One feature i liked was the ability to change resolution i would have liked if you were able to change the Hz too. Overall if you wanna spend money to buy linux BUY SUSE. Amazing Amazing Amazing distro that's all i gotta say."
39260,2,"Iolo's two flagship products are flawed and essentially unsupported. You're lucky if the newer versions install at all, and perhaps less lucky if they do. Be very careful that you don't allow iolo's tech support to drag out your problem(s) for more than thirty days, because if they manage to do so, you'll never get your money back! Tech support, customer support and any useful communication paths with the developers are all nonexistent. You will learn this at considerable expense, on hold, for great lengths of time during telephone calls you have to pay for. Iolo has no toll-free support lines."

60476,1,"I have been reading Tarot professionally for 10 years. I have a hard time obtaining accurate readings for myself... until now.I was amazed at the accuracy of the readings from this program. Incredibly easy to use & master. I especially like the editing feature... you can add your own definitions to the cards. You can create & save your own spreads & readings w/notes. Each card description provides in depth symbolic meanings as well as understandable (modern) easy to understand description of what this card means for you in your reading. Provides upright & reversed definitions. A fantastic tool to learn tarot (if you're serious), or just play around with ... No learning required.I would love to email JOHN HUCKABY & tell him that he's clicking the WRONG ICON, but he didn't post his email address. So if you read this buddy, You must click the icon that looks like fanned out cards (tarot.exe) to start the program.

Most of the Restaurants, hotels, and service centers are correct, however there some errors here also with services and restaurants in the wrong place, and others out of date with some of them being closed several years. If you are in a strange place, this could be a problem."

31684,2,"UPDATE: 1/25/2005: A bad situation keeps getting worse. There appears to be another major bug in the software's worm protection feature. If you use software that involves peer to peer communication that might occur across a range of ports (camera/chat software, peer to peer file transfers, etc.), be prepared for ""Internet worm protection,"" which is supposed to protect you from unauthorized access attempts to your computer. Unfortunately, the software cannot seem to ""remember"" when you authorize selected applications to bypass this feature, so you are inundated with worm alert messages requiring you to manually permit each one. There appears to be no tried and true way to get around this, and certain other applications don't even cause alerts - the program simply silently blocks access.The only way around this is to manually disable the entire worm protection feature while working with affected applications. This is a -major- bug and has been reported by others based on a Google search. What a disappointment.Earlier review:I've got to agree with the majority of reviews posted here. Norton completely dropped the ball on the 2005 edition of Norton AV. On a completely new installation with no other applications running, this program simply refused to install properly under Windows XP, Service Pack 2.The most frequent problem was the error message: Norton AntiVirus 2005 has encountered an internal program error, which directs you to a useless support page which inevitably asks that you dredge through the registry to remove every possible vestige of the program. Gee, thanks. Apparently, certain components did not install properly, but the program won't tell you which ones. Further, even after assuming you have finally re-installed the program properly, that same dreaded error re-appears at random intervals. Unfortunately, this effectively shuts down your virus protection so you are now at the mercy of whatever might manage to make it to your system.Despite the program updates to this date, these problems persist, and it's not just a case of a compromised XP installation.I personally am no fan of McAfee, so my strong recommendation is to simply renew the 2004 edition of what already works, Norton Antivirus 2004 and AVOID what Norton apparently considers ""progress,"" which is to say yet another unnecessary new annual edition. Remember, 2004 will have the same virus protection features as 2005 - you will still be protected. Who knew that we would need protection from Norton itself."
91239,1,"I bought my Garmin E Trex Vista on the recommendation of the salesman, telling me that I can &quot;hook it up to my computer, and download maps&quot;. Even the manual that came with the GPS gave a quick blurb about adding their MapSource software to add &quot;detailed map data&quot; to the very limited map that's built-into the unit. So I investigated both the Topo maps, and Recreational maps at the Garmin website, and both seemed quite a bit more detailed, even though my favorite lake looked only like a rough representation, with only one hill. Then I checked out Map Tech, and the detail was ten-fold! It showed every little slope, and accurately depicted every inch of the shoreline, so I bought it. The only glitch I noticed, was that the cursor on the map is supposed to show elevation, but if you follow one line thats supposedly following a contour, it's plus or minus 15 feet as you scroll, and when I pointed at the lake, then at a thirty foot hill, it showed the same elevation between the two, where the field right next to it accurately showed every foot difference of elevation But when I tried downloading the maps into my Garmin Vista, I found the only thing you can transfer back and forth between the GPS and computer were waypoints, tracks, and routes. So all I could download were little dots on that screen, which shows my lake as a blank field. Garmin Website tells me the only GPS units that accept map upgrades, (Mapsource only), are the GPS12 Map, GPS III+, E-Map, GPS Map 295, and the Street Pilot. I guess all I can do with the MapTech is print the maps to carry to the field, lug my lap-top with me on a hike, or buy a handheld, but someone else wrote that his Compaq works,but not Palm? All I wanted was a small GPS, which I could take on a hike, and have it show me very detailed maps, so I could find the best routes, and I'd never have to worry about getting lost. This one only shows main roads, how to get back to your starting point, and little lines to follow if I pre determine a route at home."
67368,1,"This product is exactly what I have needed. It is a smoothly functioning ""grand central"" for all the documents, Emails, financial information, addresses, etc. connected with all my projects. It works as advertised. It automatically saves entries when they are entered so I have not experienced data loss. The learning curve is easy. By the second day I had it doing everything I needed it to do.It does this by creating hyperlinks with the information you enter. Do you need to access an Email, or invoice, or document? Just click and it is there. Talk about fast and efficient.On top of all that, it integrates and sychronizes with Quickbooks Pro and Outlook, and it has a very pleasant interface. I couldn't have asked for more. I'm one of these people who is always looking for the best product to do the job. For me, this is it."
