40123,0,"Math, science, geography &amp; technology are well-covered in Britannica 2003. Politics and other emotional, debatable topics are not well-served in this encyclopedia whose editorial board have evidently switched policy from high-minded impartiality to that of pedestrian peddling. You see this time &amp; again in slanted writing in biographies, topical issues &amp; politics. If you want the real scoop on economics, international finance &amp; government collusion with big banks, I'd recommend The Creature From Jekyll Island instead of Britannica."
44727,0,I am not sure how to stretch this to 20 words. The chip seems to work and I really won't be using it until June. Maybe then I will find out its shortcomings.
51758,0,"Bottom line is it does work and is a kool option for a mac...but use it only if you have to for work or play. All programs will run slow and have lag. Forget any real time applications that speed is crutical for. It does run Partypoker and other poker softwares, but you will not be able to keep more than 2 screens open at a time, the lag is to bad. My Ram is upgraded to 1.25 and it does not help, maybe the new itel chips will make the performance better."
12839,1,"This is without a doubt the best OS Microsoft has released to date. I have read the reviews of the people who have nothing but negative things to say about this product and I laugh. How somebody can say Windows 98 is better is most likely running an old machine with old software. If thats the case stick with what you have. I have been running XP for almost 2 years with no problems. Stable and reliable just like Windows 2000 but with more options. The system restore feature is great if you are the type that likes to install software without checking for compatibility issues. For all you XP haters, there is hope. Windows Longhorn to be released in 2004."
48093,1,"Though I've bought many things from Amazon, I've never been moved to write a review. Until now. This product is wonderful. I'm using it in conjunction with a Spanish class at my local community college, but it would work equally well as a stand alone way to start learning Spanish. You practice all skills: reading, writing, speaking, listening, but this program makes it feel like a game. The Rosetta Stone is like having a built-in study partner available at your beckon call. Studying has never been so much fun."
85213,1,"Catz 5 was what I wanted most for Christmas this year. I got what I wanted--this game is pure FUN. I've been playing it nonstop ever since. Very much like Catz 4--except new mini-games, new breedz, are the big changes.If you've never heard of catz or dogz (or any of the series), then you must know now! These games are about taking care of cats or dogs, raising them, feeding them, training them, and breeding them--basically it's like taking care of an animal around the house (except you don't have to scoop any litter or take any walks). =P It's the perfect gift for girls aged 8-13, or people who are cat/dog fanatics.The scenes (places for catz to play in) in this game are pretty much similar to the ones in Catz 4, except now they have a Salon (umm...I think it wasn't in Catz 4 but I haven't played on Catz 4 for years), fantasy castle, AsianTemple, and a Haunted mansion. Yes, you can still design your own scenes for your catz to play in, and you now get to design your carrying case (w/ a paint program) for your catz! The scenes in this game are:The Adoption CenterBackyardBeachFamily RoomFantasy Castle (new)Haunted Mansion (new)KitchenSalon (new)--ArabiaAsianTemple (new)CircusSnow SceneSouth SeasWild WestTo get items in this game for your Catz to play with, you must defeat little miniature games that are in scenes, such as tic-tac-toe (as silver-girl said, it takes about 3-10 times to mark an X in your area), rock paper scissors, Simon says, obstacle coarse, and scarab crunch. Almost all the items in this game are old ones from Catz 4. Thank goodness in this game you can hold unlimited items in your carrying case, unlike in older versions of games where you have to hold a maximum of 9. That's one of the reasons we're all glad for this game.A female cat in this game can have a litter of 1-4 kittenz. They are almost always mixed breeds, really if you have to different types of catz. There are 15 different breedz of catz in this game -- Alley Cat, B+W Shorthair, Calico, Chinchilla Persian, Desert Lynx, Egyptian Mau, Honey Bear, Japanese Bobtail, Maine Coon, Orange Shorthair, Persian, Russian Blue, Scottish Fold, Siamese, and Tabby. You can't cheat anymore with your computer calendar to speed up the birth of your cats' kittens. Usually it takes babies to be infants 2-3 days, and kittens in 7 days. Then it takes 3-4 days to become adults. They grow up so fast...*sniff*You still have the screensaver, in this game also. But what I HATE is that you need the CD in order to launch it (like the review that person wrote who only bought this for the screensaver). Don't bother buying this for the screensaver either; it's nothing really. It's just your catz playing with random items.Please do not buy this if you already have Catz 4 and you expect a lot out of this game. If you want the extra stuff, I say go for it. It's not much different than Catz 4--just more breedz, 4 more scenes, and mini-games which you play to earn new items.Well, that's my review."
28963,1,"this is a very useful tool. i can't say howmany times i have used this in my rearch. it has both the english and hebrew / aramaic translations of the texts, with acceptions for the rashi commentartys and portions of the zohar which are also lacking in the printed editions. the only other thing that i feel this product was lacking was, a gamatria calculator which apparently comes with the bar illan software."
38161,1,"I totally love this game. But there are some weird things about it.Okay, to begin with: all the characters are ugly. Especially the veterinarian.Next: the song that plays during the credits are annoying, plus it's John's voice singing it!Melissa is too rude and John is too nice and Michael walks too fast and Linda is just too weird. The veterinarian acts like she's battery-operated or something. She walks really jerky and really fast.When Melissa tells you that your horse is hurt she sounds gleeful, and then she asks you to do a favor for her. How dumb is that?There are too many spelling errors and the horse's ancestors are named ""Game Boy"" ""Happy Cloud"" and ""Gold Finger."" What the heck! Those are the weirdest names ever.I think I know why there are so many spelling errors. I think the people are foreign or something. Maybe they're German. In the credits all their names sound German and Annie looks German. I don't know.And Melissa ALWAYS wins the competitions, even if you get no bad points and have 100% horse health and do your very best.Here are some good things about it:The chores are fun. The game is very realistic. I like how the foal is born at the end. They don't give him a name but it leaves you to call him your own name! I especially like the different settings of the competitions. You get to go inside the big mansion! I love this game. I have 0 problems with it, except that sometimes the screen goes black. But I think it's my stupid computer, not the game. It's 25 horses, their food, their stalls, everything.HINT: Coming back into the stable after dumping out the wheelbarrow CAN be a problem, but not if you walk back into the stable backwards!This is the best horse game I've ever played. They really make it realistic.You should get this game if you like horses!!!"
71222,1,"I wish the reviewer had stated whether MS Office 2003 Small Business Edition satisfies the requirement. Pending clarification, I'll stick with Encarta 2006 despite its less (than 2005 version) user friendly search page.Encarta is an amazing product for kids of all ages and I'm more than willing to predict that 2007 is worthy of 5 stars."
46321,1,"I purchased Amorphium Pro 1.1 as my first 3D modelling program. I've been working on it for about a month, and I am constantly amazed by the limitless features &amp; the incredible ease. I have found, however, the Amorphium Pro is more suited for creating models - not for creating environments or worlds. A tip for anyone who has purchased Amorphium: though there are no tutorials in the manual, there are some good ones in the program folder and on amorphium.com. Overall, a great program!"
50174,1,"I'd backed up the PowerBook completely, fully expecting the re installation of everything to be full of bumps and unpleasant surprises. The installation went so much easier than I'd expected that I came out of it feeling as though it had just done everything on it's own. All programs that I'd been using on the earlier operating system seem to be intact and still in working order. I didn't have to pull out old key codes or anything. This was a very pleasant surprise.On top of this some of the new functions are very nice to have. BootCamp works nicely, as it gives me more of the computer's capabilities to use in Windows XP. I'd previously been using Parallels, and was frustrated that a tiny amount of the computer's RAM was allowed by the program. The one concern I had about using BootCamp instead was the need to reboot the computer when switching to the other operating system. For my purposes this is a minor inconvenience. As it takes time to open Parallels first and then to start up Windows anyway, I'm not regretting the time taken to reboot through BootCamp. I was still able to make an icon of the Windows part of the drive, and it's accessible in the Mac desktop. I can therefore click and drag files back and forth. It would be nice to have this happen as both operating systems run at the same time, but I'm sure this will be available some time in the future.There are quite a few little things that have now become automated, much to my pleasure. For instance, getting access to the other computers in the home network is now a little less of a process and the icons representing other computers appear automatically in their own section of the far left column of the finder window. At the moment many of the other things just don't spring to mind. They just pop up as pleasant surprises here and there. They're not necessarily crucial things, but the details still make me happy.The one disappointment comes just from the knowledge that there's one earlier version of OSX that has a driver that can make our particular printer (an Epson Stylus Photo 1280)recognizable by the AirPort Extreme. Otherwise there's no way to get that printer to work from the router. To be fair, this isn't so much the fault of the OS. It's just that seeing documentation that there was one version that could do it, and then to find that this one can't is a little disappointing."

60007,1,Installed with ease. Excellent condition. I installed over a Office XP software. No conflicts encountered. I am very pleased with the functionality.
28100,1,"Dreamweaver consistently ranks high in the field of WYSIWYG web site editors. This release does not stray from this position. Considering GoLive and FrontPage are the current competition, it is not hard to see why (will be interesting to see what comes out with Microsoft Expressions Quartz).As with previous versions, Dreamweaver 8 has the standard Dreamweaver interface. When you install, you have the option of setting up like a developer or setting up like a designer. It is not as easy to change the scheme (or not as evident), but this is not a major deal as a single developer rarely changes the setup of his development environment.Dreamweaver 8 touts itself as the king of CSS and it has certainly made some wonderful inroads. By default, you can create styles in a page or in a stylesheet. Unfortunately, it falls a little short in allowing you to change your mind in this place, as well. It would be nice, for example, to drag tested styles from a test page up to the stylesheet. Instead, I have to manually cut and paste or recreate styles. Yes, this is minor, but can't someone make a tool that does this? I would also love to see a tool that recognizes I have already created a style with the same feature or allows me to use the standard font and paragraph changes and automatically create a style. But, I digress, there is no tool that does that ... yet.The CSS Styles tab gives you a great way of getting down to the properties of a particular CSS style. If you do not want to bring up the designer, which is how you normally create your style, you simply add properties to the style in the CSS Styles tab. Very nice feature. A little different than the properties view in MS products, but much more compact.Dreamweaver 8 is better at .NET development than FrontPage. It also allows a variety of other development paradigms: ASP (either VBScript or JavaScript), ASP.NET (C# or VB.NET), ColdFusion, JSP and PHP (with MySQL). This makes it a good all around tool for development. I would still not trade my Visual Studio, but Dreamweaver gives me a lot of bang for my buck and Visual Studio has a horrible design surface (at least in the latest implementation - VS 2005).Dreamweaver still has the best behaviors (client side scripting), but they have not made any real inroads to new functionality in this regard. This has been a major selling point to me in the past and I wish they would have included something to help with AJAX (Asynch JavaScript and XML).Of the new features, I find the CSS most compelling (mentioned above) and also very aggrevating (Macromedia did not take them far enough for my likings). You also have the ability to zoom on design and use guides (good for CSS layouts). There is also a better Flash integration and collapsable code regions. None of these are grand enough for me to personally take the upgrade plunge.Down to the nitty gritty. Here are the questions you are probably wanting to know the answer to.1. Should you buy Dreamweaver (assuming you do not already own a previous version)? It really depends. If you do not have a tool, this is still the best on the market. If you have FrontPage, you might get Dreamweaver if you need the flexibility of working outside of the Microsoft world, otherwise I would say no. The same is true if you have GoLive, as it has many similar features.2. Should you upgrade? This really comes down to a few features and how important they are to you.A) If you are heavy on CSS, you might want to upgrade, although I am not sure that this is the best option unless Macromedia really fills in this area. It was not quite enough for me to feel compelled to move on right now.B) Use a lot of flash? The time savings might be a good reason to move to this version.C) Need productivity helps, like code collapse, guides and the ability to zoom in on your design? This is the only tool I know of currently that has these features.Dreamweaver 8 is a good product. If I did not have a previous version, I would seriously consider the cost and bite the bullet, as I feel it is worth the price ($399 street). But, I do not see it worth the $199 street price for the upgrade, aty least not for me. The additional CSS is nice, but it is not enough of a productivity change for me to justify the cost, esp. when I am fairly fast at working with CSS without the additional features."
57310,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

259,1,"I just finished my first semester at RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute). BioTutor Excalibur has been a great help to me over the past few months in helping me to learn basic biology. I am not blessed with the ability to memorize a lot of material easily, but that is exactly what is required to do well in Biology; there are HUNDREDS of facts, names, and mechanisms that have to be memorized. I understand the material in the textbook when I read it, but that definitely isn't enough for me to recall all of that material when I take a test. That's where BioTutor Excalibur has been immensely helpful. Its tutorials are exactly what I have needed. I wish I'd had it when I was taking high school Biology; I definitely would have done better!I really like the way the tutorials in BioTutor Excalibur are designed. The tutorials ask questions that are likely to appear on my Biology tests. If I can't remember the material needed for any of the questions, I can click on the Learn button for that question. The Learn screen then teaches me (or re-teaches me) the material associated with that question. If I still have trouble with a question, I can click on the Explanation button. This brings up the Explanation screen, which explains in detail everything that I need to know about that aspect of the material for answering that question correctly. By doing the tutorials over and over again, I eventually master the material and significantly improve my performance on the tests and exams. The illustrations and other diagrams and tables in the tutorials are especially helpful. Also, the immediate feedback that the tutorials provide makes BioTutor Excalibur more interesting and fun to use than re-reading the textbook over and over.I strongly recommend BioTutor Excalibur to any high school or college biology student who wants to learn biology more easily and do better on their biology exams.Kurt WicksRensselaer Polytechnic Institute"

45862,1,I have enjoyed the program alot. I have only used this program for a short time but once you get the hang of it your on your way. The drawing is easy and adding color and being able to change colors on the same drawing really makes the drawing stand out.As I get into other aspacts and I get use to useing the tools my drawings look great.I like to be able to magnafie my drawing to really get close so I can see better and then when I zoom out to normal I'm really pleased with what I see.So far I havent found any limit to what I have tryed to do. I would recomend this product to any one.

6442,1,"Indie films tend to examine angst-ridden families more than any other genre. Famous examples include: The excellent ensemble piece The Royal Tennenbaums, the consistently morbidly amusing Igby Goes Down, the sleek, satirical Little Miss Sunshine, the shaky-cam shot, rather bland Rachel Getting Married etc. Indeed, it seems that family disfunction is a staple these days and with good reason, virtually everyone can identify with oddball, quirky, sometimes ostentatious family members. The Kids Are All Right is an attempt to cash in on that particular facet of the canon, ultimately to pretty entertaining effect, even if it doesn't bring anything wholly original to the dining room table.The film provides us with a duo of lesbian protagonists, for that little extra sizzle. I found this a refreshing twist and Annette Benning and Julianne Moore give understated but realistic performances. Annette is a hard-nosed nurse who might be an alcoholic and Julianne is such an ex-hippie, free-spirit type it is slightly unbelievable the two fell in love in the first place. They raise two less-than-eclectic children, a very pale girl and a sports-oriented boy in a nice house in L.A. One day, the kids look up their sperm donor father, the always reliably and charismatic Mark Ruffalo, who enters their lives and brings all sorts of calamity down on an already shaky dynamic.There is sexual tension between Julianne and Mark's character that the movie explains with her need to find someone who was is more interested in her than consistently distant Annette. This doesn't seem to be enough to convince this movie-goer. Is she bi-sexual? Also, a sub-plot with an abusive relationship between the son and a friend arises and then disappears. Come to think of it, there is a rather unsatisfying plot-line with the daughter as well, as she tries to find the ability to make the first move with a lifelong guy friend at her slutty girlfriend's behest. Sound a little commonplace and familiar? It is.Essentially you will be watching the film to see what happens to the marriage between Julianne and Annette as they struggle to deal with ""interloper"" Mark's influence, as the kids' respective dramas leave something to be desired. There are plenty of scenes of adept dialogue. A conversation about the benefits of Acai stands out, for instance, as does a subplot dealing with organic gardening that launches Annette into a fun ""anti-healthy"" tirade that will leave those of us healthy eaters who aren't exactly composing fiends a little tickled. Though not as consistently self-aware as other films of its ilk, nor as original (or well-developed), The Kids Are All Right stands out because of its hearty performances, particularly the three adults. Mia Wakowski (sp) is okay as the daughter and the son is largely forgettable. Frankly, they are just not given enough to do.This is an easy-going, sex-filled tale of contemporary Californians doing their best to stay entertained and to love one another as life changes around them. It succeeds as such, but don't expect the sassy, artistic charm of The Tennenbaum clan or the moribund giggles of Igby's descent."
67166,1,"I have not seen or used a lot of other Windows-based programs of this nature, but this one is easy to use out-of-the-box for the average user. The only thing that I have come across that is somewhat difficult is the creation and modification of print templates, which is only necessary if you want a different print format than any of the many templates provided. To get a columnar listing of your mailing list data you probably will want to create your own template. The software author should make this process simpler and bug free (template creation and modification currently has a few bugs, which can be worked around if you have the patience). This opinion is also from an IT administrator. I have no idea why an IT person would find this program difficult to use."

50722,2,"Don't waste your time or money on this crummy little program. Here are some of its many shortcomings: 1. There are NO instructions, and NO HELP FILES, (your only recourse is to navigate the hard-to-use Veritas web site) 2. It does not remember what files you backed-up, so you have to go through the laborious process of selecting what files to back-up EACH TIME you use the program), 3. There is no way to back-up only those files that have recently changed (incremental); this makes it impractical to use as a daily backup. 4. You have no control over compression, 5. Technical Support at Veritas is pay-as-you-go. 6. There is no way to display what files you have backed-up. This program makes clunky old Microsoft Backup look like a jewel."
21790,1,"I saw an ad for this product in home office magazine and was curious. Checked out the site. Company is certainly taking a new approach to sales leads, by focusing on the small business at a price nobody else is touching. I bought the product (the one with 3500 prepaid listings) and ended up buying more (about 1500) so in hindsight, I would have better off buying the more expensive of the two, and paid a little less per lead...but nonetheless, I really found it a to be a super tool. The CD basically takes you to their website where you can search for and download data. Very easy to use, and the best part of the process with dealing with customer service. They really seemed to care about the success of my campaign...helped me pinpoint the exact group of companies I was targetting and even helped me with the direct mail component.

11081,0,"The program is good, but limited. I expected to be able to choose the size output of Quicktime movie clips, but found I can only choose size in MPEG-4. There are other unexpected limitations as well. It's a good enough program, but I think what has really soured me on it is the tech support. The person who responded to my email was very condescending, impatient, and rude. When I asked him for help with some of the parameter settings within the program, his advice was to spend more money on his company by buying their Pro version. When I replied that I really just wanted help with the settings in the program I already bought, he told me to buy a book about video compression. Great.So, it's a good enough program if you already know all about working with video, but if you did, you probably would want a more advanced version. It's not a good purchase if you might need some tech help."
46197,1,"I am transitioning from beginner to novice with digital imaging and hope my observations will help readers who are just starting out, as I was a year ago. At that time I researched some of the leading affordable digital imaging programs and narrowed it down to Elements and MS Digital Pro. Largely because of other reviews at this site, I decided to purchase Elements. If you are a beginner, no doubt you have read conflicting observations of the user-friendliness of Elements from other reviewers. Some say its a breeze to learn, while other had difficulty learning the program. My experience was such that I found the interface confusing and not very user friendly. I was spending a lot of time referring to the manual to familiarize myself with basic tasks, and became frustrated everytime I used the program for about the first 6 months. However, I learned this was due to my unfamiliarity with Adobe products rather than any shortcomings of Elements itself. So recommendation #1: If you have never used Adobe products and are a beginner to digital imaging, you may want to try MS Digital Image Pro to get you acquainted with digital imaging. I purchased the program in Dec '03 and found it to be a much more pleasurable and productive experience as I acquired the fundamentals. This program has an interface that is much more user-friendly, and tasks are completed through an activity-guided process which is really hard to mess up. Nor do you need to familiarize yourself with DOS commands to perform some of the advanced features, and you won't be spending as much time (if any) referring to a manual, unlike Elements. Now having said that, if you are the adventureous type you will likely outgrow Digital Image Pro one day as your skills evolve, and will be ready to take the affordable plunge into the Adobe world of advanced digital imaging, which is where Elements comes in. Its at this point I defer to the other reviewers who have already said it all about Elements, except for one important point. Recommendation #2: If you do decide to purchase Elements, consider buying an Epson scanner, such as the 2400 model, which at the the time of this review, will cost you $129 through Amazon and will include Adobe Elements as the bundled digital imaging software. I wish I had known about that a year ago."
26693,1,"Microsoft Streets and Trips is a great value, and the name gives a reasonable description of what it does. Need to locate a business or friend? Just key the address and hit ""Find."" The application jumps right to a detail map or at least offers a list of possibilities.The application also offers a route planner to help in planning trips. You can enter a starting location and destination, but for long trips, entering intermediate way points gives a better result. Selecting the ""Directions"" menu option displays detailed driving instructions and an estimate of elapsed time to each waypoint. One warning: the directions at highway intersections can be a little squirrelly, so you might want to eyeball the map for a more reasonable approach. Selecting ""Update Construction Information"" displays the current road conditions.You can select four basic map types: road (the default), terrain, political and night. The night map is rather bizarre: it displays in shades of green and black, sort of like night vision goggles I guess. How this would be useful I have no idea. All maps can be zoomed to any degree and they show points of interest which are selectable under the ""Show or Hide Places"" option. You can select restaurants by type (15 categories) along with many other places of interest, such as airports, ATMs, cinemas hotels, hospitals, schools and rest areas. Selecting ""Find Nearby Places"" shows all selected places of interest within a several mile radius of the map's center. Places show as icons until you zoom in, but clicking on them reveals their names.There are bells and whistles galore, including GPS capability which can plot your car's position as you drive along. You can even measure the great circle distance between any two points on earth using the ""Measure Distance"" option. You can even annotate maps with push-pin labels and drawing objects, then save the result for future reference.Streets and Trips is surprisingly useful and quite intuitive. Highly recommended."
46857,1,"As FreeHand became obsolete and Illustrator became expensive to keep updated, when I retired from my graphics business I looked for a simple substitute. I just wanted an uncomplicated program that would allow me to create sharp printed materials for my volunteer and freelance projects. I bought Printfolio in 2007 and have found it fulfills about 90% of my wishlist. Pretty good for a program that costs so little. I'm hoping that eventually an update will allow us to join text to a (curvy) line and that the group/ungroup will be a little slicker. Would love to have more clipart too (and not so many balloons and clowns). But, all in all, this nifty package deserves 5 stars from my point of view. Whether you are a novice or one who just wants a good no-frills program, I believe you will be pleased with Printfolio."
43256,1,"I was forced to upgrade from Microsoft Office 2003 due to my daughter's computer courses requirements. Now that I have taken the great leap forward to the 2007 updated version of Office, I am very excited with the advancements Microsoft had made.I recommend everyone move on to the latest version as soon as they can."
60566,0,"There are, admittedly, many images. There are a bunch of cds that come with this. It will depend on what exactly you need the images for as to whether this package is good for you.There are lots of images, yes. But most I would never use. The quality of most of the images is only okay. Most of the clipart is cartoonish. The ones that are not, I never really liked for one reason or another. Poor quality, strange looking or unrealistic looking people.My use is for desktop publishing. If that is your use, I would avoid it. On the other hand, if you are merely looking for webgraphics for an unprofessional website, this might be good for you. Especially if you are willing to have a more cartoonish look to your site.Finally, I have had numerous crashes using this software. Almost everytime I have used this software for more than 15 minutes, my computer crashes and I have to reboot. I think it is a major memory hog. So beware if you have low ram."
55849,1,"I have used Iomega's ""Automatic Backup"" and ""Ghost 2003"" in the past, and I've carefully researched a number of other backup/recovery programs. I settled on Ghost 10 and have been using it for a couple of months now. I can not speak to why so many other people have had problems, but this product has worked perfectly for me from the get go. I use an external hard drive to back up my entire computer (the whole C:/ drive), I meet all the system requirements for the product, and I thoroughly read the User Manual and looked at the tutorials before starting, so perhaps that has something to do with my success with this product, I don't know. It was easy to set up unattended backups, and I've tested to see that the backups are valid. (They were.) I've also tested that I truly can boot from the installation/recovery disk, in the event of a hard disk crash. I could, but you don't just stick the CD in the drive and think that will work, you have to bypass Windows booting and reconfigure your system to boot from the CD-ROM instead of the normal boot sequence. (Just follow the Ghost 10 User Manual instructions on this.) Ghost 10's interface is intuitive and easy to use, and the User Manual and ""help"" options are very good. Two improvements I really enjoy over Ghost 2003 are: 1) being able to plug my external HDD into a USB hub port (a laptop docking station, in my case) rather than one of the computer's USB ports (Ghost 2003 couldn't see the HDD otherwise); and, 2) being able to boot from the installation/recovery CD instead of having to create/use a recovery floppy disk. My computer doesn't have a floppy disk drive, so this was a definite plus for me to be able to boot from the CD drive, in needed. Another thing I like about Ghost 10 is that, unlike Iomega Automatic Backup, it goes about its business without completely hogging the CPU (although you can configure it to use all your CPU's resources, if you want a blazingly fast backup) and it doesn't keep bugging me and telling me things and waiting for me to confirm this and that ... it just does it's thing quietly and correctly.Overall, I've had good luck with Symantec/Norton products and with their tech support, which I've rarely needed."
74396,1,"I had already bought this for my son a year ago, but I mistankenly had deleted it from the computer, started to search websites and they no longer had it. Went into Amazon and there was only one. I bought it and it arrived real fast, I downloaded into computer and its just great. My son loves it, and besides when-ever he wants to search a word it speaks the answer. Its also great to search history which my son is into to. I would give it a 10, for being the most precise software and fun to work with. Thanks!!"
4127,1,"All's I can say is wow. I had been fearful of buying this OS, thinking that it wasn't going to work on my older powerbook. It's such a shame that I waited so long.The GUI is beautiful, the renderings are quick, and my machine hasn't been restarted in weeks.Now that apple has released so many new products at Macworld, I'm even happier. I can't wait to utilize Safari and the new iMovie, iTunes and iPhoto.If you are having any doubts about switching your OS, you should visit an apple store for an hour and try and make one of their demo computers crash. It can't be done. This is beautiful software."

I eventually chose to purchase the software anyway, and I have to say that I do not regret the purchase one bit! Worth the money for iWeb alone if you're not tech-savvy enough to publish your own website. I mostly use iMovie, iPhoto and iWeb and haven't had a single problem. Save yourself a few bucks and order it from Amazon!!"

50385,1,This is a great game. It is better than the others. There should be movie versions of the games. I hope that the 4th one has all the bad guys teaming up with each other. That would be great. I didn't expect to have a trailer of the game. It was better than the one on Humongous.com. They should show who plays who in the games during the credits instead of having a bunch of names printed. I feel that it is unfair that they only list SPY Fox's voice's name. I know that they mention the names of the people who play the villains in the second and third ones but why didn't they do it in the second. Get this game. You'll thank me.
21432,1,"This CD lacks the color and the adventure of the Reader Rabbit CDs, but it makes up for thru it's phonics drills. It's one after another with little talking which is why my children burn out on it fast. I don't see that as a bad thing, tho, as children learn in quick bursts and then like a break from the drill-like phonic questions. Which is probably why they can play Reader Rabbit games for hours because it's less ceribral and more game-orientated.I love Reader Rabbit, and thank god for it, but I like this CD, too. I 'make' my 4 and 5 year old play it a little bit every day and it improves their phonics and then they can play Reader Rabbit afterward as a reward. *G*Worth the money. Helpful. Not a CD you regret buying if better reading and phonics is your goal. But not a CD the kids will be begging to play 24/7."

You need to know a few things if you are just getting started.First, this is financial software, and it is only as honest as you let it be.Secondly, read the manual. If this is your first time, you will need some basic accounting concepts in order to make this tool work for you.If you're like me, you probably bought this to get your finances organized. I found that you have to invest up front, for several hours, your time, to get everything up and going. Use the features it offers, the way they intended it to be used, and you will find it quite easy.Using quicken will not solve money problems. It will help you find out where your problems really are and how to solve them yourself."

The McAfee suite had installation problems and it doesn't seem as comprehensive. I've also used Norton in the past and ZA is better as well."
32679,1,"Basically, what you would expect in a 1:24K topo set. The thing to be aware of is that these are topo maps, not trail maps, although they do seem to have a lot of the major trails on them. I'm using them to plan a trip to four national parks this fall.One notable feature of this set is that it can be installed 100% onto the computer hard drive without jumping through any hoops. So, once you have installed the maps, you can put the CDs away for safekeeping."
45675,0,"I have heard so many great things about Suse 8.0 &amp; 9.0 so I dumped my RedHat to give it a try. Suse 9.0 was installed on my standard Dell Workstation and the installation went fairly smooth; however, I was surprised how few options I had during the install. After installation I realized there were problems with my network card, monitor, and keyboard! Keyboard?? I haven't keyboard issues in years. Yes, I was able to fix those problems, but I had to do it manually.Perhaps my expectations were too high - after hearing there is a finally a great Windows alternative called Suse 9.0 - but after 1 week I missed my RedHat Linux and went back to it."

43168,0,"Overall, it's not a bad product, considering it's from Microsoft. I consider it an improvement over MS Office 2003. This is mainly because I find the new interface superior to the old. The really annoying menus that do not fully appear from Office 2003 are gone, as are the scattered features that are not always where you would expect them to be. They are happily replaced by a more sizable but not too imposing toolbar that I find significantly easier to use. While more could be done to make it easier to use, the learning curve is not much at all for me, though I'm an advanced computer user.However, it is like its predecessor when it comes to bugs. I've been experimenting with Open Office (a free office suite that is comparable to MS Office) and was amazed that Writer (Open Office's equivalent to MS Word) opened Word 2003 documents better than Word 2007! Word 2007 really screwed up my tables. Not only did it fail to align them properly and cause text to wrap that wasn't wrapped in Word 2003, it refused to save my corrections! Calc (Open Ofice's equivalent to MS Excel) did not fare as well for me, however, in that it slightly misaligned my spreadsheets and doesn't support colored tabs, though the latter issue is of no important consequence.Is it worth $120? No, of course not, especially when you can get Open Office for free. But Open Office does not have every feature of MS Office (though it seems to have most, maybe all important ones, though I'm still exploring it), so if you want to stick with what you're comfortable with, it's not too terrible."

37312,1,"I have read other reviews of individuals having problems with other operating systems, such as Windows 2000, so please read their reviews. I have Windows 98, first edition. Like many people, I had little experience with burning CD's but wanted to get into making my own. I tried Easy CD-Creator, but could not get it to work with my Plexwriter 12/10/32, even though it shipped with the Plexwriter. After many emails and tech support calls to both Plextor and Easy CD, following the uninstall suggestions and patches, I could NOT get the software to work without freezing the system. I read the reviews on Nero and decided to download the demo from AHEAD software...BINGO..worked the first time. No coasters so far. It is intuitively easy for the beginner to start making CD's right away. I have found it to be a great program, and NO SCREEN FREEZES like I was getting with Easy CD Creator.

She really enjoys each of these gifts, but is somewhat dissatisfied with the software performance. To be forthcoming, my wife's computer has an Intel PII-700 processor and runs 128MB RAM. I know that this is no graphics work station, but considering that this is consumer grade software, I might have expected better results from it.On the plus side, this software does some excellent things, easily, like:- Prints proof sheets- Easily removes red eye- Helps you to setup your printer for special paperIn all, I think that this is great software, but would probably run much better on the new Pentium 4 machines."

I have used other off-name brands in the past and was sorely disappointed, but with this Hallmark Deluxe, I am so happy! It is a little slow to load, but what isn't these days? Once in the program, you have so many options to make a card, or to add your own photos, or to make a complete scrapbook page. It's all within a touch of a button and user-friendly.

13167,1,"I hated 1.0. It was slow and buggy. It forced you to store all your files in a single library on a single disk. The editing tools ranged from extremely difficult to impossible to use. It was incredibly expensiveThis latest release is what we were originally promised. The editing tools actually work. In fact, I find myself very rarely using external editing programs any more. You can use files that are referenced on other drives or even CDs or DVDs. The stacks are a usable tool. Some dangerous shortcut key combinations were revised. RAW file rendering is better. It runs like lightning, especially on the Intel Macs. It is reasonably priced.I have used Adobe Lightroom (beta), iView, Extensis, and several others. Aperture is now the best. Lightroom has some serious catching up to do. Several features have not been implemented yet, and we do not have a timetable for commercial release. And it is now much slower than Aperture. iView needs to learn how to handle larger catalogs and fix its stability problems. Extensis Portfolio is just showing its age.Update, now that Lightroom has been released:In general, I find that Aperture performs most tasks faster than Lightroom. That said, it is hard to choose between the two now that all of Lightroom's features are working. I have become used to Aperture's workflow and so I prefer it, possibly out of habit. Note also that the new iPhone will synchronize with Aperture folders. Aperture exchanges files easily with iPhoto '07 and '08.Importing new files is fast, especially if you are using an ExpressCard port or FireWire 800. Aperture creates thumbnails immediately and then begins producing larger display JPGs, which can be a time consuming process. Aperture does not interface with tools like DxO Professional and provides no serious batch processing tools of its own. DxO Pro will crash if it tries to open files that are currently being displayed in Aperture. However, this is not a serious problem. You could, in fact, automate a workflow that imports files from a watch folder, sends them to DxO, and imports the resulting files into the correct project. This means that there is little reason to use anything but Adobe RAW in Aperture. You can archive your original RAW files and keep the much smaller Adobe RAW files to work with in Aperture. If you really need a camera RAW file, just retrieve it from your archives and import it into Aperture.I generally do not like an Aperture library of more than about 10,000 files, as it starts taking too long to load, so I create a new library when my library exceeds that. The ""manage files"" window still needs some work. Links can and do get lost in the ordinary course of things and the ""manage files"" window is supposed to help you restore them. Unfortunately, it is a little too confusing and it does not always work. A better ""manage files"" window is probably the only item on my wish list for version 2.0.There are some interesting tools for automating your workflow in Aperture available now from third parties for free or a very low price. Some allow creation of a ""watch folder"" that automatically imports photos from your camera and displays them as they are taken -- very useful for studio work. You would also need your camera's image capture software, of course.There are not enough books on using Aperture effectively. However, most of what is written about Lightroom or Capture NX workflows applies equally well to Aperture."
23635,1,"This program accepts any size MIDI keyboard, up to a full-size 88-key one. The installation program automatically downloads any available updates from the Internet, so you should have no problem getting it installed. The requirements say Windows 95 to XP, but I have Vista 64-bit and it runs fine. Piano Suite starts off slow, has you play a song, then recommends other songs to play, based on your current skill level and/or what you need to work on. You will learn how to play many popular songs, including ones by The Beatles, Elvis, and Frank Sinatra. Many songs have multiple skill levels, so you can start playing the song at say Level 3, then work your way up to Level 5 (which has more notes and is harder to play). In my opinion, the best feature is the ""MIDI Song Input"", where you can download a MIDI file from the Internet or elsewhere and learn how to play it in the program. Piano Suite Premiere includes 500 songs. This program is also very customizable -- you can adjust the size of the music notes, the speed of the metronome, practice a song with left hand only, right hand only, or both hands, and select any song you want to play within the song list. You start off with the ""Theory Thinker,"" which gradually teaches you how to play the piano with harder and harder components (triplets, arpeggios, different time signatures, etc). The program even remembers where you left off, so all you have to do is click a button to continue. Last, but not least, the program also includes games to help you become a better piano player, biographies of composers, progress reports for multiple users, and the ability to record your own songs from your MIDI keyboard."

47067,1,"Works like a charm. Used it to calibrate an LCD on a Mac and CRT on a PC, both times it worked flawlessly. Easy installation and operation. Color change can be drastic if your previous settings weren't right, which I know is a problem for most of the people complaining. Not much control in the huey application, but enough for most users (harder to mess the settings up). It basically gives you several choices, preffered color temp at 6500K and options for 5500 and 9300 (actual numbers not mentioned, only named Warm and Cool). Actual device is rather cute, tiny at only 4"" long. Using suction cups on my LCD was not a problem, they are very soft. All in all, a keeper."
35013,1,"I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features. A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro. Installation was a snap. Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection. The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop. I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools. (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them. However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks. I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results. I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software."

I have Office on my Windows PC at work and home, so I didn't need it on the MacBook. I would have liked iWorks to provide a reasonable clipart library. This is the main feature for me that is missing. If you do a lot of desktop publishing and need power functionality of Excel and Word, stick with Office. If you need a general wordprocessor, spreadsheet and presentation package that is easy to learn and use, iWorks 08 might be for you. As usual, Amazon delivery and fulfillment was great!"

My only complaint is that the pages are so busy with information that it's impossible to sit and really read the whole book, but perhaps it's best to let a child's curiosity guide you through a number of readings rather than trying to get everything in at one sitting.

35607,0,"I'm a big ACT! fan as I've been using it for almost 10 years. I haven't come across anything that is as powerful for the price. I was initially excited to see some of the advertized features in version 6.0 because they speed up my work flow. But unfortunately, when I use the look-up and sorting features ACT crashes at least every other try. I'm using Windows NT and there are 4 other users sharing the database (and 1K contacts) but this is considered an acceptable operating environment for this program (and it's the same configuration as I had using 5.0). The feature allowing attachment of documents to a record is also useful but it has bugs, often locking up my computer or pausing for 1-2 minutes to open a simple Word document. If you're not in a rush, wait until version 6.1 or later is released in hopes that the bugs get worked out."
63451,0,"I own two copies of Studio8, two copies of Studio9, two copies of Studio9 Plus, and only one copy of Studio 10. Studio 9 Plus is the best way to go. After you apply latest patch and a new stable video card driver for you computer. Download direct-x and install that (even if you already have it installed). Studio 9 is buggy but it beats all the rest for features and ease of use. The program does install what seems like hundreds of special effects and add on that you can preview on your video but need to purchase separately in order to unlock them for use in creation of videos. Some start at $10 each and they go up up up from there. I have purchased some and liked the fact that you can buy only the ones you want, although I don't know if they are worth the money totally. The purchase of an add on effect nets you a machine and install specific serial number, no physical download. Pinnacle is worse than Microsoft for us power users that reformat hard drives or get new computers often. The entire software and all add on effects are machine specific and they even require a registration and activation to make a MPEGII video (DVD compatible video). The software sends a machine ID to Pinnacle so even after purchasing add on effects you can't use them again if you get a new computer or reformat your hard drive without jumping through hoops and begging them for a new serial number. Even that, I guess as I found out, is not even guaranteed and I personally am out all the money I paid for some add on effects after their system lost record of my add on effects purchases. Even though I have Studio 10, I still use Studio 9 plus instead. (To date I cannot get Studio 10 to work on any of my computers) In light of Pinnacle loosing my records for my add on effects purchases, and my inability to use those special effects again ever (even though I provided tech support with a receipt of purchase), I recommend Studio 9 Plus instead of Studio 10 but warn against any purchases for extras. Last note: Seems like tech support moved to India so those of us who don't speak that language can't really get any help there."
58152,1,My 11 year old loved it and was very pleased to receive it on her birthday. It is also quite challenging to keep her at it for a while.
44225,1,This is a very good program. Up until now I had been using Office 97. I was very comfortable with Office 97 having used it for many years and I was a little reluctant to change but I'm glad I did. It only took me a very short time to get back in the swing with Office 2007. It has a lot of new features and it is well worth the money.

31003,1,"After several years of struggling with ROXIO and using all of there work-arounds I finally decided to test some other products. I downloaded the test version of Corel and everything seemed to work. Of course this was just the test version.I purchased the full blown version and now I am very pleased. Everything works as expected and the speed is far superior to ROXIO. My only grip is the lack of functionality when it comes to creating a DVD menu. You can not align text. You can not hide some of the objects and customization is very limited. However, this is a minor issue compared to ALL the problems ROXIO had.What I've come to realize is that it's a coin flip. It all depends on your computer and how things are set up. There is no single (affordable) video editing software that would make everyone happy. You must test these products before purchasing and make sure to read the specs!I found Corel VSP 11 Plus to be rather stable on my system and I'm very pleased so far. My specs are: Biostar 6100 T-series mother board (socket 939), AMD Athlon 64 3800+ processor, ATI 256meg Graphics Card, 160 gig internal HD (WD) SATA, 2 gigs of memory, 1 DVD Lightscribe burner, 1 DVD/CD reader and I'm only running Win XP. I will not load any other Microsoft products because it has a tendancy to screw things up.Good luck and make sure to test the products before purchasing. If the company won't let you test it, then it's not work purchasing. Also, make sure there is good support and/or a good user forum for questions. The one thing ROXIO did have was a good user forum but so does Corel."
54769,1,"These 16 CDs are a great set of reading and math programs separated into levels (1-8 each, reading and math). I used them to supplement my kids' schoolwork during their elementary education days and was very impressed with the programs. The older boy is going to be a junior at a nationally-ranked university in Southern California, and the younger son is definitely heading in that direction. The CDs are all easy to set up and use, although the graphics assume a lower resolution monitor than that currently available."

90334,1,"After using the 2007 suite for a few weeks, I have to agree with one of the other members who gave it a high rating and questioned why there were so many people bashing this version. So far, I find this version to be very user-friendly and I absolutely love the new features. Excel is much better and offers a wider range of functions. I was one of the people who actually got frustrated about the fact that 'Conditional Formatting' was so limited in earlier versions of Excel. Powerpoint is also drastically better in this latest version. I would definitely have purchased this item if I did not get it for free. I recommend it to anyone.As someone stated earlier, this takes getting used to like any other new product. Why release a 2007 version if they were just going to make a carbon copy of 2003? This furthers my belief that people hate change no matter what it is. Just take some time and tinker with the program and you'll eventually get used to it."
57402,1,"I got this from a recomendation of a friend of mine that used it to learn to play guitar. He said it was SO MUCH easier than the lessons we tried to take to learn to play, and he was RIGHT. It doesn't bore you with playing the same chord over and over and you can play along with the guys on the DVD in like 20 minutes. It's AWESOME. Quick and easy. I am one step closer to being famous! HA!"
11089,1,"One Mac did not have a DVD reader, Apple exchanged the DVD for CD's,all work out great."
13976,1,"Piano Wizard provides a fun way to learn how to play piano and read music. I'm learning the piano along with my children and I enjoy Piano Wizard as much as they do. Currently, we are working through the lessons in the Easy Mode version. There are a few things that I wish were included with this program.1. Printed music books to use with a real piano after progressing through the 4 levels on the MIDI keyboard2. User sign-in that would record progress for each person using the program3. Option to have the computer run through a demonstration of the song prior to the user playing the song the first timeOverall, this program is great and I recommend it to make learning the piano more fun and enjoyable."
52519,0,"Well, I don't either program wins on all counts. I tried both and experienced frustrations with each. In the end, I stuck with Quicken only because Money couldn't import my Quicken data as promised.Both just seem too hard to learn. I am a computer wiz and found them both hard to use -- I can't imagine others trying to get the hang of it. They really need to stop adding features and focus on the usability of the programs. But overall, I would have to say Money did have a cleaner interface that was easier to master.However, both really fail at invoicing. They both claim you can create custom invoices, but the customization is extremely limited and messes things up so much that you eventually just end up using the defaults.So why did I stick with Quicken? Well, Money guarantees that it can import your information from Quicken, but it failed to import my data. Microsoft technical support tried a few simple solutions, but then told me &quot;tough luck.&quot; I wan't about to reenter a years worth of info, so I retreated back to Quicken since Money wasn't that much better to make it worth my while."
70950,1,"The concept and physics were excellent. However, there basically is no save feature. One cannot continue at a given point and must start at the beginning of each level. My only other complaint is it was too short."
69723,1,I totally love ALL of the Nancy Drew games so of course this one is great too. Nancy Drew and the Ghost Gogs of Moon Lake is a really cool game and I love the plot to the game. It's mysterious and spooky!!! You won't regret buying this game or any other Nancy Drew games. I'm really looking forward to Nancy Drew and The Haunted Carousel to come out!! I can't wait!!!

I tryed all of them and i can't deside wich one... i recomend this game to all harry potter fans 5+!!!!!!!! Its so cool I played it for hours with out stoping!!!"
44391,1,"Works great and used on three computers in my home. I would recommend for any type of user, would buy again."
41588,1,"I went over to my friends house one day and decided to play this game. We added sound, pictures, and wrote a great story. We had such a fun time on her computer. I wanted to buy this game for myself but it was out of stock. I'm so upset because I wanted to record my voice on it to read the story. It's a really great game and lot's of kids would love to play it."
62818,1,"I've been using this software for a few months now. I think it's well designed and through repetition and association works much better than learning from a book. I am terrible at learning languages but I surprise myself by actually remembering words and phrases when I'm not actually using the software.If you want to get anything out of the reading part you need to learn Devanagari script, which I did pretty easily using the Teach Yourself Hindi Script book. I think it would useless for this aspect if you didn't (as another review says). But if you do know the script, it really helps a lot with reading skills. Writing is another story and I try to write down the words elsewhere.One thing I'm not sure about is if they ever get into conversation. So far I'm on the 3rd unit out of 10 so they may later on, but so far I haven't learned how to say anything about myself like ""My name is..."" It also doesn't force you to come up with phrases on your own. It focuses on basic vocabulary and different tenses and relationships between objects. This is usually not much fun to learn and they do a pretty good job with it.The lessons are a good length to go through a little bit each night without being too overwhelming. You really need to speak the lines out loud though or otherwise you're not going to get the pronounciation. It helps to have a Hindi speaker handy of course although this is probably not possible for most. Also keep a dictionary around for words that aren't clear. You won't have to look at it too often though as long as you concentrate on the pictures."
62171,1,"After playing the demo of Ballistics, i was forced to go out and buy it. This game was more fun than ive had in a long time. It's the best when you hold down boost and go at insane speeds, and its too much fun!"
53721,2,Paperport 10.0 is the biggest POSh every!!!!!!!!!! I think it was released more as a harmeful virus than a helpful software tool because I can't even get it totally unistalled off my company comuter(and I am a technically skilled user). DO NOT EVEN THINK OF INSTALLING 10.0!!!!!!!!!!!!

73500,1,"There is no better program we've found than this. Though skeptical at the onset, we made the purchase. An airport sign advertised promises that seemed unbelievable. Yet months later and through interesting lessons, we've grown much in our knowledge of Spanish grammar and context. Give this one a shot, it doesn't disappoint!"
67803,0,"It is beyond me why this is the most popular distribution. it feels clunky and unfinished, it certainly offers nothing more (and for multimedia support considerably less) than other packages out there. Documentation is pitiful. It's not the cheapest either. I personally think that running Linux on the desktop is as practical as driving around town on a Mack truck, but if you insist on giving it a whirl you'll be better served by the like of Mandrake or Suse."
62065,1,"My daughter began with Freddi Fish at the age of 3 years. She would play on the computer for hours, and she was learning while having fun. This is a great program for little starters, to begin learning how to use the mouse and how to use basic computer skills. It would make an excellent gift!"

The ergonomicexercises are a considerate touch.Amazon delivered when they promised, as always. :)"
35257,1,"This software works! It does back-ups, copies, and mirrors. I had to access my external drive from my laptop after my main business computer developed a software problem. All my Nova back-ups were there and worked.I had left a message on their customer support voice mail on a Sunday. They called me as soon as they opened on Monday. They stayed on the line 30 minutes with me - they answered all questions and walked me through ALL features of the product.It is easy to use and follows the Windows Explorer format."
58213,1,"This computer game has a such a wonderful environment to explore! I wish there was more of it! The 3-D animated characters are a nice improvement over the 2-D animation in &quot;Secrets Can Kill&quot;. The puzzles are fun, and the game play is addictive. This game is a little bit tougher than the last game...you really have to hunt for those clues. &quot;Stay Tuned&quot; is perfect for anyone who loves a good mystery. It's a refreshing alternative to the blood, gore and evil in the popular software games today. I highly recommend it."
14965,2,"This could definitely be something to buy for your children, but be warned: It's very buggy. Expect glitches in the voice recordings analysis. Some notes don't even register in the software when hummed to (which is a very important part of learning a new song).The cartoon characters are fun, but there is no way to turn them off in the lesson mode. In lesson mode the characters talk, demonstrate the lesson, and then it's your turn to practice. There is no way to bypass the first two steps, which means that you must listen to their entire dialog every time you want to repeat a practice lesson. This gets _very_ annoying when you've repeated a lesson for the 15th time.The music editor/composer is a nice thing to have, especially for teachers. There are many software glitches here too. The editor is very unintuitive, and has no easy way to copy and paste parts of your composition. This makes creating drills and other practice lessons extremely tedious. Also, the undo and redo operations are very buggy: use at your own risk."
1832,1,"First, don't fall for the rebate thing. When I tried to peel the rebate sticker off the box, it pulled blue ink off the box with it, which ruined the side of the sticker that had all the vital info. on it. Also, don't expect to get an exact version of what you use online if you've been using their website. The look and feel of this software is entrely different, and some of the options automatically log you on to their internet website where you use the online stuff anyway(which is okay unless you bought the CD thinking it would be a good way to avoid the random crashes of EB's website, when it keeps saying &quot;This page is unavailable.&quot;) Anyway, the other frustrating thing is that the &quot;standard&quot; version that the &quot;install&quot; disk loads doesn't have everything on it. Once you try to look up a word (which is after you've figured out how to use the new look and feel&quot;), you keep getting messages to &quot;insert CD #1&quot; or &quot;insert CD#2.&quot; I had to UNINSTALL the installed version and then reinstall with the &quot;custom&quot; option so that I could tell it to load the info. on the other disks. However, I didn't have enough room on my hard drive for all the info. on the other disks, so I still have to keep switching out the CDs while I'm trying to look things up. One other thing, this software also loads Microsoft Internet Explorer onto your system, which is how it accesses the Internet to get info. for you. It takes you to some kind of EB home page where they want you to make a home page and set up e-mail and so on. WHY IS THIS SO COMPLICATED? I just wanted my own, reliable copy of the on-line encyclopedia so I could look up a word whenever I wanted without worrying about the site being down. I got a whole lot of other headaches along with what I wanted. I'll use it, but I wish it was simpler and less sly about coercing me BACK onto their website."
57169,0,"I agree, this software is good. Great detail. The 3D feature is over-rated, though, for my uses. More of an image gimmick than actual representation of terrain. More importantly, though, my software suddenly &quot;lost&quot; one much-used quad sheet, leaving white space in it's place on my screen. I also lost all the markers and trails associated with that area, which included several day's work. Called their customer service for assistance and was connected to a very rude, arrogant, and unhelpful technician. Result: no fix. The company needs to back an excellent product with helpful and knowledgable technicians."
28041,1,"I haven't tried out Tech Tool Pro 4 but I do know that DW flat out works. I have a late 2004 iBook that had serious errors and read ""Invalid Node Structure Error (2403, -36). I went to an Apple store talked it through with one of the staff and bought it upon recommendation. Came home, backed up my HD, popped in DW and after it ran everything was fine. It even gives you a detailed report about what was wrong and what was fixed. This thing saved my computer without a doubt.One caution...this is not a quick fix tool. It took roughly 12 hours for it to fix my HD. But I don't care at all. I would definitely buy this tool."
88422,1,"I am running out of options, since I refuse to move to Illustrator CS4 or 5, except for 'special' situations. Canvas 3.0.6 and this 7 and also ver. X are so far superior to Illustrator's over-loaded (who needs that feature), bloated, unintuitive, piece of junk code. I highly recommend Canvas 7 drawing package for scientific drawings and graphics. I use it daily, drawing first in Canvas 3.0.6 in layers and then into 7 for creating an .eps! Just a toss and save.Unfortunately, you will have to have an old Mac with an older OS 10 that supports OS 9 running along with OS 10 to use it. Or an older PC with Windows XP. Well worth hanging back from newer OS's and being forced to use crummy Illustrator.If I could deal with a PC and the buggy MS OSs, I might move to Canvas 11, but nothing would make me deal with MS issues. I just do not have the time luxury to deal with the constant MS OS updates, viruses (updating of virus software), trojans and all the rest of the time wasting found in the PC environment. I value my time and I have been very spoiled by Deneba, ACD and Apple."

63887,1,I generally do not use the interview process and go straight to the forms. The program works great. The review section is a pain as it starts from the very beginning if you change some data.My main complaint is I had to purchase a new computer as I was using system 9.2 on the mac and it would only work on 10.2.8 or later. Intuit has done this before where they require updated computers that still work with all other programs. It's great to have a new computer but I didn't spend $35 from amazon for the program-I spent $1235 for it.
40158,1,"I recently received Encyclopedia Britannica 2003 Ultimate Reference Suite on dvd. I read all the problems people had with it, but decided to purchase it anyway because of the content. I had no problem downloading it to my hard drive and the user interface is straight forward. I don't know why people are having so much problems with the software. It may be because they are using Windows instead of OS X.Although it is easier to look an article up in the book version of the encyclopedia, it is a lot more economical to buy it on dvd. You receive 3 volumes of encyclopedias, a dictionary, a thesaurus, atlases, quick time movies and much more ..., plus you can download updates. You can't do that with the print version."
29136,2,"I've been a loyal Norton customer over the years and it's sad to have watched them go from lean and mean to bloated and nonworking.The upgrade from NIS 2006 to 2007 went smoothly enough, though my subscription ended up being shortened (you buy a subscription for a year, but if you upgrade before the very last day of your old subscription, you lose whatever time was left on your old subscription).The problems began when I tried doing anything with my PC after this product was installed. Browser hangs, ccapp.exe (Norton's engine) application errors that can't be cleared without a reboot--expect all of this and more.Norton Technical support is useless. They basically tell you to uninstall all other software on your machine except the Operating System and NIS.I uninstalled Norton and will give McAfee a try, but am not holding my breath. I think I'll try the strategy of a friend at work--have one P.C. connected to the Internet and use that machine just for things like music, gaming, etc. while keeping all personal information (finances, etc.) on another machine disconnected from the web."
67343,1,"I use plan drawing software in my work. All I need is something to draw simple floor plans for my document packages. This works better for me than newer, more complex programs. It was loaded on my old computer, I inadvertantly deleted it. Glad to find this old software at Amazon."
30945,1,This product is by far the best one i have ever used. I highly recommend it over any other program out there. I have used numerous other programs and they dont even compare to this one. This product is extremely easy to use and has all of the features you would need to edit your videos and far more. If you are thinking about buying this product i highly recommend doing so you will not be disappointed with it.

Do not expect miracles from this program or AlohaBob PC Relocator Ultra either.This program will only transfer settings, not programs. If you need more, your out of luck.This program lets you be very specific in what you want to transfer, the interface is simple and user-friendly, migrations are a bit slow in my opinion.This program is PRECONFIGURED for 80 known and popular applications!! If you are pc illiterate, unfamiliar with networking, software settings, etc. - this program makes it easy for you and it only costs about $40.If you need applications moved, ALOHABOB PC RELOCATOR ULTRA is the way to go.

93890,1,"Risk 2 is definitely worth the bargain price. The many different gameplay options allow for different challenges for one or more players. Some old high school buddies and I decided we would try getting together once a month to keep in touch, play a game, and chat. This game allows for intense gameplay while quality time with family or friends. The tournament is extremely challenging because it forces you to play the game in the different modes which does not allow you to develop a consistent strategy. This is a plus because games that allow you to form and follow a set strategy get boring and monotanous after a short time. The &quot;Same Time&quot; strategy takes a little while to get used to, but definitely is an addition that benefits the game. It allows for multiple attacks, both from two or more of your countries, but also from several of your countries and countries of other players. If you and a fellow player attack the computer at the same location, for instance, once the computer has been defeated, you and your buddy &quot;go at it&quot;. You also have to watch out for &quot;surge attacks&quot; where an opponent can attack you one place and then immediately go into the next country while you're not even aware of it. If you're into a challenge or want a game which allows for some competition and quality time with family and friends, get Risk 2."
24232,1,it was very good!! that you for this product my child likes it very much. thanks!
2533,1,I had recently purchased a new PC with a 250 GB hard drive and needed a proper backup system. I purchased the Norton S&R along with a WD 250 GB external hard drive. They both meld perfectly with no installation problems or other adverse issues. It is exactly as advertised SAVE AND RESTORE (didn't even need a special backup program)
38357,1,I'm an independent worker/contractor and have to say that this software truly impressed me. The next time I do taxes I feel I'll be even better prepared using some of the tips this package offered. Totally worth it.
38148,1,I have the other version of this game. I hope this one is better and more fun-not saying the other isnt. Let's Ride!-Horse and Pony is very cool. I hope this will be cool and different. I cant wait till it comes out!!

11106,1,It is about time a manufacture of something in the world gets it right. After searching the internet for a product that looked easy to use and not full of junk I would never need I found it in this software. If I were into sports I would look into their other products. We are using this software for addresses for our wedding and it has worked perfect. I like the way you can add the names of other family members and their birthdays and notes. All and all it is just very easy to fiqure out what you have to do when you want to enter info and print labels and search or sort the info.

79503,1,"Microsoft Works provides a workable word processor The new calendar applet is much easier to use and will import your old addresses if you have the 7.0 version. Works can perform very easily most of the major tasks that Word provides such as footnoting, page numbering, typesetting of longer documents.In contrast to the products offered by Sun Micro, the Works CD includes multitudes of useful clipart and there is a link in the Help menu to help you download multitudes more. The dictionary links to Encarta Encyclopedia. The one thing I didn't like so much was still the underdeveloped nature of the spreadsheet. It is more suited to home-related tasks and not to linear algegebraic functions. Still, it was nice to be able to edit excel 2003 documents and save them in a usable format for work."
65457,0,"I too have used many CD/DVD creation products. On technical competence on a scale of 0-10, I am about a 9. Version 9 is early out to the stores and still has lots of bugs, mostly related to incompatibility with older PC hardware.If you are a novice and plan to start small with burning CD's for music or backup, you are probably OK.If you are a novice and plan to begin editing video and burning DVD's, you will have to wait for the bugs to be addressed and plan on upgrading your PC as well. You will not succeed until then.If you are an experienced user, you will still be frustrated (as many others are) trying to get your older hardware to work, until the bugs are addressed. Even then, a new PC may be in order. Until then, you will (as I have) spend many nights experimenting, only to fail.I would consider Nero as an alternative for a ""suite"" based product. However, I cannot get confirmation they support double layer DVD's yet. According to their literature, they do not."
71305,1,"Even though I did have to get used to the environment, this is the one project that I use everyday and highly recommend to those who do not wish to spend millions of dollars. This is the one product where you can use multi-platforms for important presentations (anywhere from Web Page Design to Word Processing To Graphics To Internet Use including E-mail To Spreadsheets/Databases). You can also write a friend and export the file to be read by MS Word. Highly Recommended!"
6181,1,Loved the item but felt like amazon tricked me into the shipping. Described as if by now will recieve by a certain date. Not true. You actually paid an outrageous amount for this shipping. I ended up paying more for shipping than for the actual product. Would have saved money driving and buying it at retail store. Buyer beware of tricky shipping!!!

4156,1,"My five year old son is a science buff and really enjoys the Magic School Bus series of software. This one appears to have many different areas to click on. His favorite game is where you pick between 2 bugs or predators of insects and they ""fight"". Through this game they explain how some insects use various secret weapons (smell or acid for example) to beat even larger bugs or animals. My son will play this for a long time if I let him."

67407,1,"this comes with avengers v1 1-402, v2 1-13, v3 1-84, 500-503, and new avengers 1-12 plus annuals. That is just about every comic but, there are two things I can think of that are missing: secret invasion and giant size. That is not cool because vision and scarlet witch get married in giant size (in avengers 500 she hulk rips vision in half)and wasp dies in secret invasion (not surprising considering the lame weapons she got from hank)but other then that this is a great set.Marvel Comics - 40 Years of The Avengers Comic Books Collectors Edition on DVD-ROMMarvel Comics - 40 Years of The Avengers Comic Books Collectors Edition on DVD-ROM"
30357,1,"My 3-1/2 year old son loves this and can run several of the games independently. It sometimes makes him laugh hysterically.I have some pretty strong biases. I think most educational toys are oxymorons. I think a 3-1/2 year old should be having fun, not building a resume. I figure K-12 will provide plenty of opportunities for structured learning.This is a great purchase if you want your child to enjoy time with a computer and get some basic mouse skills. The only draw back is that you may have to adjust your mouse settings with respect to left/right click recognition (some other software for the younger set handles this internally)."
60874,1,"This has been my favorite screen saver.I have seen most of these fish in their natural settings. The ones in this program look realistic. Their movement appears natural in all dimensions. The Lionfish is a particularly breathaking work of art. The spines, fins and tail move independently. The eyes are not static. Each fish moves in and out of the immoble coral base. My resident purist objected to the fact that some of the coral, and fish would not exist together in nature in the same place. My resident pursit also noted that there ought to be sea urchins. On the other hand, I did not have to swallow any salt water or get a sunburn to see the display.The program installed easily and did not upset the rest of my computer settings. It is easy to change shading, contrast brightness and on-off timing. Th program easily adapts to screens of varying dimensions You only get a limited number of fish together at a given time. At first this bothered me and I wanted more simultaneously. I changed my mind after I tried out another aquarium program that allows many more fish. After a while I decided that too many fish become distracting and less realistic.Marine Aquarium makes it easy to change the visible fish. Kids who come into my office like to change the fish themselves. Several of the available fish are similar to some of the stars of ""Finding Nemo"" and the kids like to make sure that these fish are visible."
15183,1,I have used this tax package for several years and have been pleased with it. I was a Turbo Tax user for about 5 years. I decided a couple of years ago to try Tax Cut because it was lower priced and seemed to have the same features. I have not been disappointed by that decision.
27390,1,"We can't get this to work on our computer - blurry letters, and can't get it to play. Can't tell if I would like it or not. Not the fault of the person we got it from though - it came very quickly and was still in its package."
54248,1,"This entire review was dictated into Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 without a single correction - I have subsequently put corrections in ALL CAPS so that you can evaluate for yourself the quality of dictation. I said (SIT) in an open cube without doors so have coworkers on either side, yet Dragon captures my dictation without a problem.This is truly an awesome product. The biggest problem with voice recognition software is the quality of the recognition, and I have found that this version provides nearly flawless voice-recognition. The software is easy to install, easy-to-use, and is a great time saver when writing long documents. While it can be used as a keyboard replacement and use (USED) for short messages, and to perform Windows and applications commands, that is essentially anything you do at the keyboard, where I find it most valuable is in writing long documents. For normal business users, the key benefit should come when writing documents, as any profession (PROFICIENT) typist would likely be faster using a keyboard and mouse for Windows and application navigation.The biggest challenge with voice recognition software is that when errors are made they are typically not captured by a spellchecker because they are legitimate words, and therefore a lot of time is necessary to review and correct errors in a voice-transcribed document. All in all this is a highly recommended solution that will be sure to save you time."
40985,2,"Better than nothing and may be a good product if it was 10 years ago but in this day and age of advanced software it stinks! Detail is sketchy, print outs come out nothing like what you see on the screen.

5759,0,"Conseal PC firewal at signal9.com is still to me the best firewall. Too bad they don't offer it on CD though. If you must have a CD with the program then get this or Guard Dog, if you don't mind the download I advise getting Conseal."
17447,1,"I'm happy, but product ships with version 2.2 of the software, that kept resetting my LCD monitor to about 5000 degrees K. This is way too warm. On my own, dowloaded version 2.3 of the software from the ColorVision website, and BINGO, my Samsung LCD monitor looks great. ColorVision needs to get the word out, on their website (home page please) or through stickers on the box! Poor souls who simply buy and install will be quite disappointed!"
87441,0,"The only complaint I have is that the GPS device did not always work. I installed the software on multiple computers and some computers already had it installed. But on every computer I tried, from laptop to desktop, the GPS device would act funny and only work after about 5 minutes of messing with it. Then, when we went on our road trip to California, I plugged it into my laptop and it only worked about 30% of the time. I'm not sure what happened, maybe just a faulty device, but it caused some frustration. Software program is excellent and accurate, however. I've been using Streets and Trips since about 2002 and i've always been pleased with how they update their software."
78407,1,"For labeling CDs and DVDs, this is probably the best program there is, but due to a dearth of serious competition, it isn't all that great. The nicest thing is the ability to import CD info to the label so that you don't have to manually type it in. If you make a lot of CD backups, you definitely will appreciate that feature.I never use clipart but some people seem to think it is the raison d'etre of labeling software. If that's you, you'll probably like this package, as it has enough clipart to wallpaper an airport.The plastic applicator that comes in the box is a pathetic joke. I would buy a Stomper applicator to go with the software."
17838,0,"Ok, This Harry Potter Game Is WAYY Different Then The Other Games. The Controls Are Horrible And You Can't Even Point A Spell In The Right Direction. I Mean I Just Got The Game On Christmas Eve and I Jumped Right On The Computer To Play It.Oh My Gosh I Was SO Suprized. I Didn't Like It That Much. The Game Is Weird. You Don't Talk To Anyone At All And You Never Push Buttons To Open Doors Or Battle People To Get Father Into The Game. Ok For Example, If You Have TO Battle A Big Boss And It's Hard To Beat Him , All You Have To Do It Walk Through The Door. And In The Other Games Maybe Only One Character Knew How To Do A Certain Spell But In This Game Everyone Knows How To Do Every Spell. Which Brings Me To Another Point. In This Game You Can Switch Players. You Have To Stick Which That Same One For The Whole Level. And If You Die You Die. You Can't Switch Players Right Before You Die. Sry For Writing So Much.{:}"
20670,0,"You will NOT learn a foreign language by one of these programs. The vocab is way too limited, and neither the Version 8 series nor the Version 9 series addresses past or future tenses substantively. I have purchased six of these over the past couple of years, four Version 8 (German, Irish, Latin, Hebrew) the other two Version 9 (Spanish, Italian), and for some idiotic reason, the Version 8s are SUPERIOR to the upgrades. The Version 8s have more texts and thus more variety. LatinNow Version 8 is probably the best program I have seen from this company, good texts of various grade levels, plus you can fresh up on your Roman mythology!These &quot;tapes&quot;, and that is basically what they are, computerized language tapes, are only going to be useful if you plan on dedicating time for rote memorization of grammar and vocab outside of the program. These programs can be good to help supplement textbook study, as we need to hear the language and grammar for it to sink in. If you think any one of these programs in and of itself is going to make you fluent, you're very sadly mistaken. I would recommend finding them cheap and working on them while you eat breakfast, then spending 15+ minutes a day per language w/ grammar, vocab, writing (ie thinking w/in the language), out of a textbook. That way you can cover your bases, if you are the self-guided student looking to master a new language to get a head start on college credit or to learn it just for the heck of it.Also, the Hebrew keyboard layout is atrocious and barely functional. I assume this might be a problem w/ all non-Latin/Germanic alphabets, like Chinese and Russian. This makes the games worthless--and the games are probably the best part of the program."
62129,1,"I wasn't expecting a whole heck of a lot from this, having never heard of Redoubt Software before, but I was pleasantly surprised. These tables are all fun to play; even the older ""Lost World"" table. ""Lost World"" has no background music however, which may be realistic, but it does sound empty compared to the others, which all have full music soundtracks.And speaking of sound, the digital effects are all astounding, except for when the ball hits against a non-scoring item, like a side rail or a corner post. Then you get a lame tick-like sound that is scratchy and sounds like something is wrong with your sound card. But this quibble doesn't detract much from the overall enjoyment.Graphics are first-rate. The tables are all very colorful and accurate renditions of the actual tables. My only other gripe would be that the angle of view is non-adjustable, and you can't see much of what is going on at the top end of the tables. Variable viewing angles would have been a very nice option.Also, the physics engine is excellent, resulting in lifelike gameplay. Overall, a very worthwhile investment for all pinball fans. And if you like this collection, I also recommend ""Pinball Madness 3"", which contains 10 more tables from Redoubt Software in their earlier days along with some (...) tables from 21st Century. I would recommend ""Pinball Madness 3"" only for the Redoubt tables however; and be warned: ""PM3"" is difficult to get up and running on some computers. Conversely, ""Williams Pinball Classics"" installed beautifully."

29399,1,"One day back in fifth grade I saw a Saturday morning cartoon where the hero had to hack into a computer to save his friends. Being a typical kid I was all hyped up about computers and programming that whole day, so when I saw this in a catalog I decided I had to have it, and didn't stop pestering my mother until she ordered it.Simply put, it was phenomenal. It taught me the basics of programming, and it made me really like computers. Next thing I knew I didn't just want to program simple games--I wanted to do websites too! So I moved on to designing websites in HTML when I was twelve, PHP the next year, and so forth, and now I'm a prospective computer science major.The software's easy enough to understand. It gave me a little trouble once when variables were introduced, but it was so engaging I kept at it until I figures out the concept. Looking back it was very 'retro', kids nowadays might feel it looks a little too '90s', but if they have any motivation to learn to program (and it's not something the parents are sort of 'forcing' them to do) they should really care. Five stars!"
37084,1,"We received this game quickly and it certainly looked like a new product. In order to instal the game in our new computer using Windows 7, it was necessary to follow the enclosed instructions which involved the use of a setup disc. After using the setup disc, Imissed a plainly stated instruction and had to e-mail Derek at Ostrich for additional help. After Derek pointed out what I had missed in the required steps, it was only a short time until my Wife and I were able to enjoy playing Yahtzee. Thank you DEREK"

83695,1,"Having reached the end of Movie Maker's capabilities, I knew it was time to move up to a program which produced better quality movies. I tried a few ""demo"" versions of other programs, including Premiere, before making the purchase, so I was not unfamiliar with it.The interface is a bit clunky at times. Being a Movie Maker user, I suppose I am just accustomed to the Microsoft way of doing things. There is a good manual, however, and the package comes with a DVD containing training materials.What impressed me the most, early on, was the output quality. I was always a little dissapointed with the the final product generated by Movie Maker. Premiere produced crystal clear output.As I researched these products, I read reviews from some folks who felt the hardware requirements for Premiere were high. I found Premiere to be a very good performer on my system, an AMD64 3200+, 1 gig ram, and a single 160GB hard drive. A solid system but definitely not cutting edge.An finally, the price at Amazon was significantly better than I could find anywhere else. There were some bundle packages out there, with Photoshop Elements, but I did not want Photoshop Elements.All in all, I am glad I went with Premiere Elements, and Amazon."

33159,1,"I really resisted going to OS X, but the reviews were good for 10.2.2--Jaguar--and I decided to take the plunge. I love it, even though my CD Writer (Que USB) &amp; scanner (Umax Astra 2200) don't work with it and there are no updated drivers for these two. I can switch back to OS 9 to use them. For my printer (Epson SC 800) there is a generic driver that I downloaded.Advice: 1) Go to Apple's web page and check the large discussion section about your peripherals to see if they are supported yet. 2) Follow directions exactly when installing the new system and keeping OS 9 on your computer. 3) Once you are using Jaguar, download &quot;Safari&quot; from Apple to be your browser; it is much faster than Outlook Express.OS X is so beautiful and smooth that I will put up with the hassle with my scanner and CD writer until I get new ones. Since OS9 and OSX work side-by-side so I can use my old applications such as Microsoft Office without a problem. (I'm not going to spend the money for the new Office.)"
81655,1,"I have used Avery Mac LabelPro for several years(Ver 1.64) and have found it the best labeling program that money can buy! The new version, 1.74, is a continuation in quality and performance of version 1.64. It is easy to use, accurate in placement and concise. Easy to use and logical in function, I would venture to call this a &quot;must have utility&quot; for any computer buff using either Mac or PC compatible!"

65073,1,"Microsoft Publisher 2003 isn't much different than the other versions. I purchased it because I am in real estate and Microsoft has loads of templates for my profession in the 2003 version only. You might want to look at all the templates available to you before deciding. The program is so easy to use, it works like Word and PowerPoint. I think it should be part of the Office Suite and not something I should have to purchase separately. Microsoft products are what they are. They do the job...they are expensive, but without Microsoft we wouldn't be where we are right now...at Amazon.com."
72834,1,"Weatherbug provides probably the most accurate weather you can get. The weather information it provides comes from the National Weather Service. Everyday, I look at Weatherbug often to plan my day, and to read ""Storm Central"". A place where articles are written. Very interesting... It also provides UV index, ""The Fun Zone"" where ""fun"" stuff can be found, Air Quality for determing how well the air is outside, traffic conditions for certain areas at this time and so much more. The product is well worth the money, and the weather in my belief... is MUCH better than The Weather Channel.Also, it retrieves the forecast from over 8,000 weather tracking stations across the United States. So there should be a station very close or close enough to you. At this time, Weatherbug does NOT work outside the USA.Overall, I'd recommend this program to any weather fan, or person trying to plan their day and the day ahead!"

It was very confusing and difficult for him to understand (if even). The lessons were read very fast, I even had a hard time sometimes following. If we used the slow-down pronunciation option, it sounded like a record player on the wrong speed. The only word by word translation was at the end (like a dictionary). And it didn't even have all the words that were used in the lessons.It might help you if you had taken German before and would want to refresh or deepen your skill."

93301,1,"Great little stylus. stays put on my finger without pinching or binding. It was listed as a 3-pack, but they sent me 4. It obviously won't store on the Pocket PC, but since it's a multi-pak, I keep one at each desk/table where I normally use the PPC. If you have small hands, like a young teen girl, they will probably be loose, but they have enough flexibility to fit most adults, I think. I'm a man who wears large or XL gloves, and it looks like they would fit a range of fingers smaller and larger than mine."
19175,1,I love this product! My son is in a Spanish immersion class at school. He has a hard time in school learning Spanish. He loves to come home and jump on the computer to play this. He would rather play these then video games. He loves the games and singing. They put together a great game that kids keep interested in and learn. I will buy more products on Spanish learning from this product.

The multi-snap function makes this a breeze quickly bring any drawing to life. Don't be fooled by the experience levels control, it just turns off certain buttons for beginners and then on again for experts. Go ahead and use the expert level (you have to anyway to get through the &quot;getting started guide&quot; that comes with the software). The manual that also comes with the software is extremely informative and must be referred to several times until you learn all the tricks and hot keys. Once again, I feel this is a GREAT program for the price!"
71960,1,"I am a graduate student and I use my Palm IIIxe to do a variety of tasks, mostly to keep my calendar, address, book and to take notes.I bought a little keyboard so that I can type rather than use the screen touchpad for entries especially while taking notes in class or at the library.Prior to using the Documents To Go software, I just used the memopad for my notes. This was not a good solution because I could not add any type of formatting to the notes and would end up having to restructure my notes. Now with Documents to Go, I can use bullets, bold and other formatting features. Its great! To date I am happy to report that I have not lost any of my data and it has made it easier for me to store, retrieve, and search my notes. I have even used Insert Table to create and edit tabular data. Not a bad investment if you ask me."

The music is also delightful. It's education that goes down like sugar.It's a real shame that the game is no longer manufactured."

However, when I tried to import the HD footage on my G5 Mac, it wouldn't import! It turns out that iMovie can only handle standard def AVCHD on a G5 Mac, not HD footage.

48064,1,"I have my own language school, and hold a Master's degree, along with PA Teaching certification, in German. The ages of my students fall between 4 and 60. Although the program is definitely not appropriate for those under Kindergarten (a German word!)age, I heartily endorse it for students of all other ages. I love how students can practice all language skills: reading, writing, listening/comprehension, and speaking. The speaking/writing section features a scale which monitors pronunciation of words or phrases which are said by a native speaker. I think this is ingenious because it allows students to develop the correct accent. So many programs and word books tend not to stress this vital skill. What's the use of the phrases or words if students cannot hear them first pronounced correctly, and, then, have the chance to pronounce the words or phrases on their own? The native speakers pronounce everything very clearly (sehr deutlich!). One criticism: I would like to see some grammar explanations as part of this program. Even beginners, especially adult beginners, need to know the how's and why's of grammar so that they may learn to create their own sentences and to manipulate the language themselves. Otherwise, two very big thumbs up! Ein tolles Programm f&uuml;r alle!"

94459,1,"Here are my thoughts on NAV 2006. For antivurus protection, it is one of or even ""the"" best. If you have an old/slow computer, this may not be the program for you. Otherwise, it is a great program. For spyware removal, Norton ranks low on the test scores. I run Webroot Spysweeper for spyware detection and removal. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bad folks out there that get their kicks out of messing with our computers. A free or no-name antivirus program just won't give you the protection that NAV will. Until NAV gets better with spyware detection and removal, you will need a second program. If you really do your research, I think you will find that to be the case with all the antivirus programs. My two cents worth is buy NAV 2006 - and buy Spysweeper or Spy Doctor(I think that is the other program with good test scores). Good Luck!"
89576,1,"This is a little late now that 2003 is coming out. However, for people wondering, this is a rock solid OS. Blue Screens of Death are rare now. It is plug and play so installs are easy! Microsoft is well on the road to providing a decent OS. Mind you this is comming from a person who is not a fan of the company.Now this is not a gaming OS! If you have games that were written for 98, the probably will not work or will work badly! If you program, you can't go wrong! It is a huge improvement over NT.However, with all things, there are somethings that you have to do! Get the service packs and the hot fixes! Also, there are some extra stuff that gets installed such as the media player. Microsoft hid the uninstaller in the original release. IF you get Service Pack 4, it will correct that..This is worthwhile just to get rid of BSODs and if you have a laptop running NT, you have to change over! However, XP it probably a better choice!For games, look into XP!"

There are a lot of subtle improvements throughout the system, including new address book and mail features, updates to the disk utility, the file browser, the terminal...too many to mention.The search functions in the finder and email are much faster now, too.Was it worth the $200 we paid for the Family Pack? Heck yes!"
45406,1,"I haven't had much opportunity to use this software to its fullest potential yet, but I tried a few sample problems with it and I was pretty impressed by its step-by-step action. I bought the software because I am COMPLETELY befuddled by all things mathematical and I will have to pass at LEAST one more algebra-related course in order to get my degree. I wanted to be prepared. From what I can tell, as long as I have a working computer and this software program, I should be in pretty good shape. Ask me after August of 2008 and I can tell you whether it paid off or not!"

True, you can't import v4 into v6 or 7, but that isn't that big a deal to me, as once I print out my plans I don't need to go back to them.The only thing I was disappointed in with v6 was it's extremely limited selection of 3d models, much more limited then v4 and v4. I thought I would be able to find 3ds plumbing and other things to import, but have found no source online and there is probably nothing free. No corner tubs, only a few types of sinks, etc. If v7 can improve on that I would probably buy it just for that as it has a lot of excellent features. Much easier to import and scale scanned in floor plans, etc."

93736,0,"When I used this product for the first time I was very much disappointed. I followed all instructions for setting up the software to work with the GPS itself. This is where it failed. The first thing I was told I had to do was update the PN-20 to which I connected it as instructed in the manual. It looked like all was fine for about 15 seconds then the update just sat there doing nothing at all. This is a firmware update in case your wondering. After well over an hour I decided that the update must have failed and I clicked ""cancel"" it did not cancel, the software or update itself was froze. I couldn't even shut it down and my computer told me that the program was not responding. I unplugged the GPS, The GPS was now useless due to a very bad update put out there by DeLorme. It would turn on only to show me a white screen beep three times and shut itself off. I searched their website for an answer and low and behold I found one. Many people seemed to have had this same problem and they put instructions on how to solve it on there site. However, even with said instructions nothing helped to revive my dead useless expensive new GPS unit. I called the company the following day and the service tech instructed me to follow there online help instructions. I told him I had done that already more than a few times and it was not working. I was then told I had to send the unit back to get fixed. I was not happy. I had to pay shipping to get the product and now had to pay shipping ' only by UPS also mind you ' to send it back. A week and a half later I got my GPS back. I decided NOT TO UPDATE the unit dispite there being a update available for it. It works ok now for the most part. Batteries die very quickly and the map software is VERY difficult and NOT USER friendly at all.I wondered why there were so many USED units of this same GPS on e-bay as well as other sites like amazon. Now I know why. So many people had this same problem most of them just demanded their cash back. Can't say I blame them. I am keeping my unit only because I can't find one with the features I want for less than what I can afford. TO those of you looking at this piticular GPS "" TAKE HEED"" to getting into a big mess and possibly sending it back before you can use it. One alternative may be to buy USED because maybe the bug is fixed in those units. GOOD LUCK"

Roxio is now owned by Sonic (makers of 'MyDVD').7.5 was an incremental upgrade. 8 is a new product with a new interface and numerous new features. It is a huge product suite that makes lots of system changes- install it carefully.Always make sure you have your registry backed-up before installing software like this (I recommend Iolo 'System Mechanic' 5 or 6 for registry maintenance and back-up- as well as other maintenance you should be doing regulary).Even better, buy a disk imaging program (I recommend Acronis 'True Image 9') to make digit for digit copies of your drives before making any major changes to software and hardware configurations."
64886,1,"This upgrade to Photoshop Elements adds important functionality in handling raw files from digital cameras; this was the reason I upgraded from version 2 (FYI, the rebate process was reasonably smooth.) I like the image controls and capabilities on the raw file upload window much more than what comes with the Canon FileViewer (I have the Canon Digital Rebel/300D.) Nonetheless, I think that the uploading, viewing and editing of raw files can be done much better. The only issue I have on the editor side of the software is that when I upload multiple raw files, I have to do the settings for each one before the next one comes up. This prevents easy batch loading, but worse, if I decide I don't want one of the pictures, hitting cancel cancels the remaining uploads as well.My bigger issues are with the organizer side of the software. The small LCD makes it so that I can't weed out all the shots I want on the camera. After making a first round of cuts on the camera, I need a larger view to make a second round. There is no easy way to do this with the organizer; I can upload from the organizer just fine, but it doesn't fully delete the files from my card when I tell it to. As a result, I have to do my second round of cuts using jpeg preview on Canon FileViewer. I then convert the CRW files to Adobe's DNG format using a separate program, DNG Converter (I think the successful adoption of DNG as a global standard will be a huge benefit to digital photography,) before going into Elements. My second beef with the organizer is that it begins by trying to load new files on its own, but always hangs, forcing me to cancel the automatic load and then manually load new photos.I didn't expect to use the organizer at all, but with the exception of the mentioned problems with adding new files and removing files from my CF card, I found the organizer suits my needs as an amateur quite well."

327,1,"SmartStart is the most comprehensive software package for learning French I've found. It's not cheesey, and it's well written, and you get an audio CD, a cassette, a grammar workbook, and a computer CD ROM all at once. It takes a little bit of effort, but you will totally learn some basic French with this. I've tried other programs, too, like Transparent Language for French--and they're just not as well implemented (clunky or hard to understand or use in some way). I really recommend trying the SmartStart stuff first."
13411,1,"Beyond Atlantis is a wonderfully animated game and a must for anyone that loves puzzles. The colors and video sequences are beautiful and the characters have interesting though often one-sided personalities.I bought the game for the similarities it had to Myst and found that it was not a bad buy. Atlantis 2 is quite similar to the original Myst but not as in depth (character wise) as Myst 2 and 3. The puzzles themselves are not a great challenge, but the steps to get to them make up for their shortcomings. Overall, the major shortcoming of the game is the lack of information. Often you are unsure of what you need for a puzzle or why you need to complete it other that to beat the game. Few clues are given so a good hint site is recommended; however, don't just for help at the first sign of trouble. The game is made to be able to look 360 degrees and up to the sky and to the ground and the makers expect you to use this ability. Before you run to the walkthrough, look around, search the ground, and ask the characters about EVERYTHIING!Overall, this game is great for the puzzle person that doesn't mind some lack in character development. The game will take time but is definitely a come-back-for-more type of game. The graphics and legend lore are wonderful. Finally, as an individual who has played through the game three times, I can say the game is worth it."

Just buy this game based on age and experience appropriateness."
66465,1,"I've followed business planning software for years, I've done lots of plans for myself and clients, and I've worked with people at all stages of development. This one, the Premier version of Business Plan Pro, is definitely the best for the informed user, who wants a lot of customizability and power.For example, this one lets you create virtually unlimited Excel-compatible worksheets, which have Excel-compatible functions, and can be linked to and from the main already-built financial model. Specific example: you don't want to do your own set of linked financial tables (i.e. assumptions, break-even, sales, personnel, profit and loss, cash flow, balance sheet, ratios) but you want to do more detail in long-term assets than what the standard built-in model allows. Just add a worksheet, put all the detail you want, and you can go to the preconfigured main worksheets and link out to the new one.Not that this is a template for Excel; it isn't, you don't need to have Excel to work with, it has its own Excel-compatible worksheets.What this means is that I get the power of starting with the main worksheets, which I know work well, and are documented and error-proofed, correct accounting and all, but I can also add in whatever else I need. Flexibility is critical.Which reminds me that the text portion of the plan is very nicely flexible for adding and deleting topics and tables, which is also essential for real business plans. The text portion of the plan is a lot easier to use and work with than straight Microsoft Word, although, to be honest, you do have to make compromises ... Word has more power and flexibility for straight word processing, but with this one what you get is clearly good enough -- it's a business plan, not a magazine layout -- and if you can deal with not having every bell and whistle then you can move topics and subtopics about, and link and unlink tables and charts, much easier than if you were really working with raw Word and Excel.I think of this as the best of both ... I get all the power and flexibility I need, but if I stay within Business PLan Pro I also have a great starting point, financials that will always link and be doing cash flow correctly, but it is designed to do exactly that, business planning, and nothing else. And in the end, what it prints out automatically is very much good enough, even if I don't get to put colored lines into the footers or resize graphics. I can import graphics easily enough, although I do need to resize them correct before I import them.This version also has some really cool collaboration features, an email system that lets me work with a client and receive portions of the plan and incorporate them into the working plan without worrying about wiping out what I intended to save. I've also used its template system to make a subset of the full plan, export it as a template, and send it to a client to fill out. He then sent it back, and I was able to absorb it back into the main plan.I use Windows XP in the office and Windows 2000 at home, and I have had no problems with operating systems. I have contacted support once or twice, to be honest I was annoyed with for one question that they referred me to the manual, but then I discovered that the manual is built into the software, so it's right there, and they had the page number correct, and it was a pretty good explanation.If you simply want to get through a business plan quickly, Business Plan Pro is the same basic plan and interface (both of them have lots of business planning content built in, lots of help and instructions, etc) for less money. If you know what you're doing and you want power and even more flexibility, the Premier is worth the difference. I use Premier myself but I will recommend the Business PLan Pro version instead when I have clients who are afraid of the whole thing.So I guess I'm making this too long, but I really recommend this product."

Now the bad part.. it's true what some people have said about this program, it crashes outlook. I sometimes have to kill the Outlook via task manager and restart the program. Lately the program has gotten buggy.. why I have no clue.. Now it's not even working even though I installed the latest version. I hope they come up with a fix for their problems because i do like this program for what I've seen, but if it doesn't work, then it's worthless."
1129,1,"I got my upgrade from Amazon for $280. And while it's a little expensive, it is a suite, not just one program. The changes are great, once you get used to them. If you are a long time user of MS Office, you're in for a shock. The entire GUI has changed. All the menus are gone and you have a bunch of buttons along the top seperated by tabs. The shock wears off after a few weeks once you figure out where everything is at. The reason I don't give it full stars is that there was little documentation to cover the changes for someone used to the old style. I was on my own to learn the changes."

9750,1,"Mortal Kombat was easily (and still is) the BEST video game movie ever made. All the characters are properly represented, they keep some of the special moves, a few fatalities, and even a Friendship finsher. The plot is cheese, but who cares...the fights take center stage in this film. The 2 best fights in the movie are Johnny Cage vs. Scorpion and Liu Kang vs. Reptile. It ends with a cliffhanger, which unfortunately did lead to the God awful crappy sequel MKA (please avoid this film at all costs). If you're a fan of the games, you will enjoy it, and if you aren't, it's still an enjoyable, entertaining film. This movie was leaps and bounds better than the Van Damme Street Fighter movie. In fact, I have yet to see a movie based on a video game that was this good!"

Time Machine and Quick Look alone are worth the price of the upgrade. Apple is on a roll."
56580,1,"This program doesn't teach anything special that is not easily taught outside of a computer game. Success at the game will be had most quickly if the child already knows the skills needed to play the game (see below, i.e. already knows their basic shapes). If you want your child using the computer during the preschool years then this is a safe and good bet. If your child doesn't know everything this program covers already then they are sure to learn it quickly if they like the game and are not discouraged. There is much more to phonics than this program covers, of course.We held off introducing our son to the computer until he was almost 4.5 years old. We strictly limit what he can do on the computer and he does not use it much, sometimes going 2 months or so without using it. We purchased this program when our oldest just turned 5, at which time he already could start up the computer, open a program, change CDs and close the entire system down all by himself. I thought it best to buy an easier Reader Rabbit game and see how he likes it rather than start off with the Kindergarten or the phonics Reader Rabbit. If you have a 3 or a 4 year old (or even a 2 year old) that you want using a computer game then this one is great (see section on phonics for a possible difficult part though).Being unfamiliar with children's computer games I was surprised that much of this is almost like a video on television, there are songs that seem to be about 3 minutes long and very graphic and long introductions to the program every time it is started and before each game. The characters on screen tell the user what to do. I was disappointed it did not come with written instructions, as when my son needed help there was nothing I could turn to. Goodness knows I am not sitting with him all the time watching him play, so I miss the already-spoken instructions for the overall game. Instructions for the mini-games that they play can be repeated by simply clicking on a certain character on the screen.I sat down to play it as a new user and we played for over an hour. I was annoyed that the instructions are not clear. Specifically, the program has the user doing a little job to earn a gem called a brillite. They wanted 5 yellow brillites to start. We did all the jobs but there was a missing brillite. There was no instruction as to how to get this missing brillite so we re-explored every area on the program's map and began repeating jobs because we didn't know what else to do. That began earning us different colored brillites. It is a little unclear to me as to how to win this game, they say to gather brillites but we really don't know how many of each and how to exactly get them except play in a random manner repeating the games. I'd much prefer them to say ""repeat all the games to earn the blue brillites in order to earn the missing yellow brillite"" or some other such informative instruction.This is truly geared for preschool age (3 or 4) or for any age that already knows the 6 colors of the rainbow, circle, square, oval, triangle, diamond shapes, if they can count to 10 and follow oral directions. The hardest part of the game, which may be difficult for preschool aged children and may cause frustration, is the phonics portion. An object comes along on a raft and there are 3 sparkle shakers above it and the user must choose which sparkle shaker (with a letter on it) represents the first letter of the object. The first go round has the word written under the object (i.e. violin) but after that round is won the object comes out without a word. Shame on them for showing a giraffe and giving both a g and a j as options! Bad choice for beginners to phonics! The user will be told if they make an incorrect choice and they can narrow it down by process of elimination. The game with the train and matching the object shape is more of a fast paced game to improve hand and eye coordination and fast mouse-usage than a true matching game-if they pick the match right after the fast changes they are doomed. On the box it says this does drawing and coloring but that is a stretch: the kids are told to paint a certain shape a certain color and they simply click once on the proper color and click once on top of the shape and it is instantly colored in. There is nothing about drawing going on there! The only math here is counting up to 10 (it is advertised as having math on it).There is nothing offensive or questionable about this game, the language is clean, etc.This is a fun game for preschoolers (I found it too easy for my just turned 5 year old). It is very entertaining in that it has interludes in between games and songs with a few minutes of on screen entertainment. The songs are catchy. The graphics are very good compared to the old days of Space Invaders and such!"

27143,1,"I've been looking at this game for some time and finally bought it. I'm not sorry. I really like the game. I found that my horses have different abilities like some would rather not jump and some are better at the cross country. The area around the farm that you are aloud to ride in is fairly small but then you also have the four coarses you can practice on as well. There is also alittle interactiveness with some characters in the game that makes it a little bit more interesting. I find that having 5 horses to care for is quite difficult and can get a little borring. I can spend 30 minutes just in cleaning stalls and careing for the horses, but if you don't go to bed (in the game) you don't have to clean the stalls all the time, but if you want to compete in competetions then you need to go to bed to make the time pass. (a rock and a hard place).My horses seem to be getting sick frequetly and I'm not sure why at this piont. This is upsetting because you cannot ride when the horse is sick.Over all this game has been quite fun. I don't have a horse and probably wont beable to get one so this is fitting the bill for the moment. I recommend this game to horse lovers."

This being that almost all of the manuvers are made by utilizing various keys on the keyboard, not the mouse. They also need a parent's help with getting started on each of the various games, but once they get the nack of it...they have a ball! I, myself, have played this game and have had a blast!

83685,1,"I have had Adobe Premiere Elements 1.0 for a few weeks now, and I am very happy with it. It does everything I would want to turn my home video into DVDs: Capture the video directly from my camcorder, edit the video, author the DVD, and finally burn the DVD. I found working with it very easy. It came with an introduction DVD. After watching it (about 1/2 hour in length I think), I was ready to make my first DVD.Adobe Premiere Elements 1.0 only works with a firewire cable. My camcorder supports both USB and firewire, and other video applications work fine over USB, but Adobe Premiere Elements 1.0 requires you to use a firewire cable.It won't let you burn dual-layer (8GB) DVDs. Only 4.7GB DVDs can be burned. It also won't burn VCDs or SVCDs. However, you can output your video to MPEG, QuickTime, or Windows Media and burn it in another program.The DVD menus you can create are somewhat limited. You cannot do all the cool things you see in commercial DVDs. However, for home video, Adobe Premiere Elements 1.0 does what you need: Simple menus with ""Play All"" and ""Select Scene"" options.For the money, this is the best home video program I have found."

If you have any fears you won't be able to pick up, forget about them, the tutorial with the software is incredible, taking you step by step with examples on how to make good levels and models. They even give you resources for more designs to use. This software is well worth the money for a newcomer or an expert."

I especially like the web import tool. It was a little difficult to find it and get it working with Internet Explorer, but well worth the trouble. Once you open the tool in IE you simply highlight portions of an online recipe, mark what the text is (title, instructions, picture, etc) and then import directly to Mastercook. I love this new feature. If you have an older version, it is worth upgrading. If you have never tried Mastercook and are looking for recipe software, this version is a good one for the price. It comes with many recipes and you can easily add your own or collect new ones online!"
61362,0,"I first purchased this software while in college for a class project. We had to start a buisness, name it, hire employees, and manage it within a three week period. One requirement was to have a presentation at the end. So I used this software to design my car dealership. It did produce a good visual and 3D model to use. The software is a little hard to use, the colors are off, and the included extras (cars, funiture, tv's, ect.) need to be updated to this century, and heaven forbid that you try to create your own extras, the creation wizard is more geared toward a engineer than someone who is building their house for fun.I see that version 5000 is out now, hopefully they have improved it from the previous version."

23013,0,"This software is good because your child just moves the mouse and doesn't have to click it, so they can get the hang of the mouse thing slowly. The problem is that there are only 4 activities - and the music one isn't very exciting. A lot of watching and not much doing. My son really enjoys the &quot;popping balloons&quot; game though, and it has helped him with his mouse skills (he is 2 1/2). Reader Rabbit is the best for teaching mouse skills, but this is a good supplement"

24231,1,"My ten year old has been playing this game since he was 5. He loves it. We even bought a new copy when our old one broke. I even play by myself sometimes, the puzzles are that fun. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it would have been helpful to have hints for the last level of puzzles. We can't quite get a full set of zoombinis through on those last levels. Other than that, it's a lot of fun."

53301,1,"I have been using MS Street & Trip since 2000. This 2006 version is an update for me, mostly because of the added GPS function. Although all kinds of maps are availabel on the web, it is still a must to have a copy of software like this installed on our portable laptop. The map part may not be very different than earlier versions, except a few fix and updates here and there. It is the added GPS function that make it really part of our daily life."

75886,0,"Well here we are with the next Poser version. I just can't help to think why didnt e-frontier just make a PRO version for 6? Poser 7 adds better memory handling and finally takes advantage of duel processors and hyperthreading, but at this stage, I'd think Poser 6 should have done that already. The new supplied characters are lackluster next to the Daz family of characters, but they do offer a great variance for any crowd images and background characters you want to render. I just still can't help but feel that Poser 6 should have had the new base features already in it, or that Poser 7 should be a bigger leap forward. - if you're a die hard poser user, then by all means take the step up, but if your satisfied with Poser 6, then step back and just watch. I personally have gotten a huge gain from the duel core usage, but if you're on a single processor, you would not see much if any gain from it."
1519,1,"I bought Microsoft Outlook 2007 for home use because I had used it while at work. Now retired, I found myself missing the power of this program. Some of the online email sites were very slow at downloading my email and I found that frustrating. I can now connect with three different email sites and download them at the touch of one button and in less than a minute. I can also set it up to do auto downloads at set intervals if I want to. The calendar is very good to use as well. I can download other internet calendars, which I do, for my favorite pro team game schedules as well. Installation and setup was a breeze. I don't see any cons after this purchase."

81344,2,"Was using old Total Home Deluxe 3.0 by Broderbund, worked well, but crashed too often as not designed for XP..So 'upgraded' to 3D-HAD-5.0 (then 5.1), and (as several reviewers noted) not compatible w/ anything..OK, start from scratch..after figuring out a highly counter intuitive UI, found that the only way to design a split-level home (which i am expanding) was to explicitly enter floor and ceiling offsets from ground level..did that , but windows placed on 1st level appear near floor level!..tech support said that is b/c it 'thinks' its the same level and make sure no walls from 2nd floor are touching walls from first floor..Excuse me?!? it is a split-level and of course the walls touch! (but even when i separated the walls, the windows still were on the ground)..also 3d rendering/rotating was excruciatingly slow (and i have 512MB ram . 2ghz pentium4)"
13628,0,"I chose this antivirus based on other reviews and comments, hoping I would have the same experience. I agree that it is user friendly, but I find it very annoying. Everytime I try to run software that is already installed on my computer, it takes Zone Alarm forever to ask me if its ok for that program to access the internet. It takes so long that I end up thinking that my computer froze. I've had to uninstall it twice because my computer kept crashing on me. I'm finally where I need to be but my computer runs slower than when I had Norton installed. I switched from Norton thinking all I need was just a simple antivirus, nothing complicated and I have yet to see software out there that will do that. I am hoping that Microsoft's antivirus program will be successful so I can switch. After the rebate, it comes out to $10 bucks - not bad to have an antivirus software for $10. You do get what you paid for."

I upgraded largely to ensure the best compatibility with new third party applications, but there are many great features here in mail, iCal, security, multi-tasking, and so on.I have two tips:1 - Buy ""The Missing Manual"" by David PogueMac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual[NYT Columnist, some say humorist, and Mac geek]. His book helped me understand how to get the most out of this OS which would have taken too much time otherwise.2 - When upgrading do a completely erase and install. Of coarse back up your data first on an external HD or in the cloud with Jungle Disk.Enjoy."

Also they no longer supply email or technical support for it on their website. Certaiin things are missing, for instance part of the staircase dialogue is missing. There is not the setting for stringer waste. Also when in the properties page of any item, if you click on appearance the program crashes. it is ok as a toy for messing around on but without support I would not buy it for serious work. There may be a forum around where one can get solutions to problems."

So the parent will have a ball along with the child!I highly recommend buying this for any child or fun loving parent!"
7769,1,"I bought this software perhaps a decade ago and it's still one I use on an almost daily basis. As a teacher, I'm always making posters or handouts or charts of some kind. I know how to do these in Microsoft Word and Publisher, but find Print Shop to be easier to use. I never thought I'd use the 5 CDs of clip Art, but I do. There so much in there, from textures to borders to photographs. You can use pre-made designs or create your own. I use this for address labels, holiday cards, award coupons for my students and do not find it buggy. I recently bought a new computer with Vista and it even works on that! I have bought the non-pro version of this, but find the pro version gives you more design options."

73394,1,"This is actually a review for more than one product (Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone)If you are willing to spend 1-2 years learning a foreign language but have limited time (weekly), lack the ability to immerse yourself in that culture for 1 year (the best way to learn the language), can't attend classes, can expend some budget, and want the process to be challenging yet fun, here's how to do it:1. Buy a good English-Foreign Language Dictionary.2. Get the Pimsleur Course for that language. (Check Ebay for used copies)3. Buy the Rosetta Stone Program for that language. (Costly. Try the online monthly subscription option if your budget is tight.)4. Get a Basic Grammar Language Book (Barron's highly recommended)Putting it all together.1. Listen to the Pimsleur Program during your daily commute-1 lesson per day. (Take the weekend off) DO NOT go to the next lesson until you have a 80% recall of the material. THERE IS NO NEED TO BE AT 100% RECALL before going to the next lesson. (Trust me on this on-avoid my pain)Using this method, you can get through ALL Pimsleur lessons (Levels I-III)in 12-18 months. THE FOCUS OF PIMSLEUR IS SPEAKING SKILLS.2. At the same time, use the Rosetta Stone lessons on the weekend, with one 60-90 minute session. Go through the guided exercise followed by the test. THERE IS NO NEED TO GO THROUGH EVERY LESSON (TYPE) for each program. After you buy the product, you'll know what I'm talking about. THE FOCUS OF ROSETTA STONE IS LISTENING SKILLS.3. Review the basic grammar of the language as you go through the 2 above.4. Contrary to what Pimsleur says, look up any words for spelling, and likewise, for Rosetta Stone, look up any words for definition you don't understand.Bottomline: Despite what they advertise, these are not stand-alone programs. Also the secret to recall is anticipation, meaning an 80% success rate for Pimsleur is ok and 70% success rate for Rosetta Stone is okay before moving to the next lesson.You don't get any extra points for making 100% and this effort can be counter-productive (burn out, boredom, and frustration before finishing the lessons.)Your goal should be to get through all of the programs and lessons and the experience should be challenging and fun. Afterwards, you can take your trip to that country for the total immersion experience, and after the first 2 weeks, you'll see how well spent your time was with the programs.After you complete the above, and you are learning one of the romantic languages (German, French, Spanish, Italian) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using the Michel Thomas programs-which are essentially Verb Conjugation 101 lessons-it is the glue that ties everything together you learned with Pimsleur/Rosetta Stone.Note: I've used the Japanese, German, and Korean Pimsleur Courses, and Rosetta Stone German and Japanese Programs. I've also spent extensive time in all 3 of those countries. Learn from my mistakes.Good luck and have fun."
89734,1,"I bought this to capture high school basketball games from old VHS tapes, edit them on my PC, then create multiple DVDs of the result. It worked very quickly and easily. The conversion from VHS to PC was a piece of cake: plug and play. The ""capture"" process presented frames for fine editting done just by sliding frame brackets. Didn't play much with titles, captions etc, but I will soon. Then created multiple DVD copies of the final editted ""movie"" I created - just kept feeding in blank DVDs and pressing ""go"". Also copied VHS tapes directly to my PC DVD-writer and that was fast and simple as well. I am delighted with the simplicity. Of course separately I did have to buy a DVD burner for my Dell laptop, cuz I didn't have one before. But now I am all set to move all my home movies from VHS and video camera, for editing on my PC, to write to DVD."
40011,1,"This is a terrific little set of applications. If it had only been GarageBand it would have been worth the modest cost. GarageBand is a sturdy, multispectrum, easy to use multi track recording studio. Its predecessor was pretty basic - but the new version is a substantial update. The user interface is simpler and more straight forward. I can now utilize all of the outputs on my mixer (earlier versions limited me to a few at a time). The loop record function allows me to overdub again and again as I practice a riff - the stacked riffs can be isolated, and cut/pasted into the final mix with remarkable ease. There is a basic but formidable set of effects, including a very passable compressor, a great limiter to maximize volume without sacrificing quality, almost unlimited mixing capabilities.But its not just GarageBand - the new iPhoto is a tremendous improvement as well. I've seen some critical reviews stating that having the library available only within the application is a hassle. Its actually not. Its easy enough to sidestep this in any of several ways - import the photos to a separate file before adding them to the iPhoto library - you can then import them into iPhoto from their folders, but here's the benefit! If the drive you import the files to is different from the one you have the iPhoto library on, well then you have just created a backup for the photos. Its always a good idea too to burn a CD or DVD with those images in case of a system or hardware crash! I love the new ""events"" feature. It is so easy to keep track of images now - being able to preview all the images in an event without opening its library is a great time saver. And I love the interactivity with the internet - I've posted a few web galleries directly from iPhoto - they look great and so far everyone I've invited to look has been impressed both with how easily the galleries work and how stable and fast the are.iMovie works wonderfully - although I've upgraded and purchased Final Cut Express 8 - iMovie is great for rough cuts, but FCE offers much more diverse tools for polishing!iWeb is a limited but functional website builder - it lacks the diversity and flexibility of GoLive or Dreamweaver, but then I don't always have the time or the energy to use those applications for very basic informational webbing.And finally, iDVD does exactly what its supposed to.I think that is the critical point about all the Apple applications I own - FinalCut Express, Logic Express, iLife and iWork, OSX Leopard. They do exactly what they advertise, and do it well. If you have an Apple machine that meets the hardware standards (read that last line again!) then you can't go wrong with these applications! Once you've bought iLife, make sure to watch the short but helpful training videos on the Apple website. It will jumpstart your usage!"
4557,1,"Swedish Now is an incredible piece of software. This is a really good way to learn a language and this software takes advantage of everything technology has to offer in regards to language learning. It uses video, has extremely detailed audio features (you can listen to every Swedish word in the program), and uses voice analysis technology to help correct your pronunciation. When you get bored learning or feel you need to practice the Swedish you know before moving on there are some really fun and intresting games to help you practice. My impressions of Swedish Now is that it is well worth the buy and it will help you learn to speak Swedish."
35159,0,"I actually found this title to be pretty easy to use and, for the price ($29.99), it's a great deal. Yes, most of the images are through an on-line subscription but you download and save as many as you want. No, there are not 30 discs of clip art but your not paying $100 either"
63210,1,"Despite the non-user friendly interface, this application has a huge amount of details. First, I mapped my home, it gave a very accurate and detailed coverage of the neigborhood, including most of resturants, stores, movie theater...etc. Once I got used to using the program, it was easy to move around (alt+arrow key) and zoom (alt+page up or down) using keyboard shortcuts. I like especially the printing features: Travel package, you can choose how many miles of the route you need to be covered on a page. Print overview is good. Print big maps on up to 3x3 pages.This program uses the layers feature (similar to photoshop) so you can add or hide layers or routs on the main map. it is also nice that you can calculate a route by setting the start/end point to be one of points of interests already tagged on the map (when you fully zoom in).Again this program is not very user friendly and it took me some time to get over my anger. But overall, I think it was well worth the money."
14828,1,"I'm giving EZ Drummer 4 stars for the CONTENT. But not forthe ""ease of installation"".... what a pain in the neck.The files on the DVD are dated 2009 - and are NOT compatiblewith any current Windows 7 installations out of the box! Aftermany attempts to install, on a brand new fresh install of Win764-bit, it just kept bombing out in the installation. So Iwent to the Toontrack web site - they don't have an email anywhere,only a forum (which is pretty sparse) and a ""support"" wizard.After filling in the wizard (which you can only do after youregister at their site), I did find the error I'm getting - Windowserror 1308. The FAQ here states basically ""the files on the DVD arereally outdated so you need to download the current version fromyour Toontrack account"".... it's a 700MB DOWNLOAD! It's not a hugeissue or deal breaker, but I just wanted to warn others to not evenbother with the DVD. Chuck it in the bin.I just don't understand why they are shipping 2.5 year old softwarethat isn't compatible with current operating systems. Pretty low class.The drums? Awesome! Once you get past the bizarre installation ritual,the plug-in is excellent. Works very well with REAPER DAW software."
16575,1,"McAfee Internet Security 2005 7.0 is a great solution for everyone using the Internet on an ""active basis"". My experience with the software has been great so far... From what I understand, not many people like McAfee because it loads alot of ""processes"" in the computer. My parents and I are thinking of switching to ZoneAlarm Security Suite but think that McAfee does pretty good for what it was made to do. It protects email spam, it has a firewall, it has an antivirus, and Parental Controls... really all the neccessary items to have on a family computer. Fortunatly, at my home, we all have our own computer but my parents have told me not to visit inappropriate websites and I don't even want to. Therefore - I do not have much knoweldge if the Parental Controls work well, but I am sure they do as all the other services do. I would reccommend this product to anyone looking for a standard security solution, especially if you have a family PC. Highly reccommended!! - but I would try to get a different antivirus.. for example you can do a Google search for either Kaspersky Antivirus or NOD32 Antivirus. Those 2 are very good, just check out virusbtn dot com and type in those names. You'll see, and Good Luck on your purchase (if you purchase) on McAfee Internet Security 2005 7.0!"

8717,1,"I bought this for my 3 year old grandson who is now 11 years. He had the best time with this and we were able to pass it on to his cousins who enjoyed it for a couple years. It wasn't perfect, it would hang up occasionally and you had to have the right size keyboard to attach it to, but overall I thought it was one of the best computer games out there for children. They always see us at our computers and want to get there hands on them so this was a great idea. They were in front of a screen getting hands on without wrecking havoc by pressing things they shouldn't. I started with my grandson in my lap showing him how to work it and it didn't take long until he was able to work it all on his own. I now have three more grandsons that would love this but it isn't available to work with Windows Vista and/or 7. There also was a Tonka version with it's own playset for the keyboard which was great also."

There are a lot of things improved since Ver 4.0. The ability to shape terrain is great. The ability to build curved walls, and the ability to paint specific surfaces in 3D with differant materials are both welcome additions. 3D render quality, speed and functionality are vastly improved."
65986,1,"The Sibelius G7 supports all sorts of fretted instruments, including banjos, steel guitar, dulcimers, mandolins, gamba, requinto, sitars, ukulele, vihuela, dobro and lute. In addition you can add keyboards: piano, electric, synthesizer, honky-tonk, percussion: all sorts of drums, cymbals, tambourine, wood blocks, handbells, too many to list, string instruments: treble and bass clef, and voices.For the guitars and fretted instruments it easily converts from notation to tab and vice versa by selecting and then copy/paste. You can also edit the tab properties to your liking, and watch the playback on the fretboard.There are also preconfigured staffs, that have the most popular combinations of instruments, even a mariachi band is included.Note entry is easy and intuitive. You can use the mouse, or keyboard, and also click on the fretboard. The documentation and tutorial are clear and easy to follow, and within minutes you will be composing or transcribing some music, arranging to fit your band or ensemble, and printing it out or uploading to the Sibelius G7 website to share with others. The printed output is nice looking too and comes with several styles including Jazzy and Handwritten. The program itself seems stable on my Windows system, unlike Noteworthy which caused the computer to hang (losing my work when I rebooted).Finally, G7 will meet most of your needs for small ensembles and bands, and unless you are composing a symphony, you won't need the really expensive Sibelius Professional edition. The price is right and it's fun to use. The included Kontakt sounds emulate the fretted instruments pretty well. I should also mention that it does notation for guitar special effects like pull-offs and hammer-on, bends and releases, slides, trills and vibrato, tremolo arm bends, slides and scoops, as well as notation for chord slashes and strums. Chord diagrams can also be easily created above the staff. There is just so much included, you won't be disappointed."

35057,0,"As has been previously pointed out, Poser 6 seems to have been designed by a committee of people..that did not much like each other.The user interface is pretty terrible. It seriously needs revamping to a more Windows-like format.The cration of figures yields very good results on the other hand, although additional content can run into big bucks. Be warned.My biggest beef with Poser 6 is with applying clothing to the model. It is ludicrously hard to do. It is TEDIOUS to the point of suicidal depression. There has GOT to be a better way.Actually... there is a better way: placing the artical of clothing in position , the ""shrink-wrapping"" it around the figure, using the polys of thye figure itself as a guide. I do not have the coding skills to write such a sub-routine myself, but there are plenty of people that do.Poser 7 is supposed to be coming out this year right in time for Xmas. I REALLY hope efrontiers is not doing a rush job on getting Poser 7 out in time. That was done with Poser 5 when it was released and proved a serious botch job. Poser 6 is only a marginal improvement over it's predecessor. I am hoping 7 will be a REAL improvement.What the program REALLY needs is a complete, top-to-bottom redesign; from scratch. What we have actually seen so far is new versions of the same old thing; a patch, on a patch, on a patch."
33920,1,"Let me start off by saying that I am a native English speaker, and I am also an ESL teacher. I purchased this program so that I could use it to supplement my classes and give my students some extra practice. It has its up points and down points. Let me explain what I think of this program from a teacher's point of view. THE GOOD: 1) Like other &quot;Learn to Speak&quot; titles I would have to say that its strongest point is helping students learn vocabulary and pronunciation. It has some good vocabulary lists, a gauge that allows students to see how their recorded pronunciation compares to a native speaker, and wonderful simulated conversations that allow learners to practice English in a very life like manner. 2) It has several cultural movies about cities in the United States. They are very enjoyable and teach students about geography, history and U.S. culture while allowing them to practice their listening skills. 3) If students want to study something other than the lessons included on the four CDs, they can download additional lessons from the Internet. It is very easy to do, takes about ten minutes, and there are several topics to choose from. THE BAD: 1) The dictionary is good for nothing except helping students to pronounce words. Since this program is entirely in English, there is no translation for the words. It really is quite a useless dictionary! 2) You can't print anything! I thought it would be nice to print out the words and expressions so that students could take them home to practice them, but alas, you cannot. 3) The program (including instructions) is entirely in English. Don't get me wrong, there are many benefits to this, but if a student is using this for self-study I don't think they will get far before tiring of trying to understand all the English instructions. (For Spanish speakers I would suggest &quot;Hablemos Ingles&quot; from this same company.) 4) This program really is for lower level learners (first and second year.) My advanced students enjoyed the cultural movies, and found the simulated conversations novel, but the rest wasn't helpful to them. 5) If you already have version 7.0, then don't bother upgrading to this one. Only the simulated conversations are better. The movies and lessons seem to be the same - only organized a bit differently and in a more confusing manner. OVERALL: This is a good program if being used to supplement a current course or to give learners extra practice. I wouldn't recommend it for self-study because lower level students might have a hard time with the English instructions, and more advanced students would find it too easy. Definitely don't upgrade from version 7.0! If you are thinking about getting this program I would actually recommend that you get version 7.0 - you can find it for a much cheaper price, it is very nearly the same and it is organized better."
69914,2,"We found this to be completely useless on our trip to Ireland in June. We rented a car in Killarney and drove the Ring of Kerry, the Ring of Dingle, and up through The Burren to Galway. Thank goodness we had a map from the rental car company and a guide book with halfway decent maps. The Garmin could not recognize most of the addresses for our hotels and couldn't even find a lot of the towns. I'd say over 80% of the time it didn't even show us as being on a road and I took one picture where it thought we were driving in the ocean.I don't know whether it would be useful in Dublin. Like I would imagine most people do, we used public transportation there. It was a complete waste of money. I am considering writing the company to complain and requesting a refund."

12392,1,"Windows XP home is a operating system from Microsoft that finally defines stability and ease of use into one. If you are thinking about upgrading from Windows 98, go straight ahead, if you are still using Windows ME, please immediately upgrade. This operating is very easy to use with a redesigned start menu that provides easier access to programs and accessories. More stable because it is built upon the Windows NT kernel so it won't crash but your applications will software apps weren't built on NT, only the Operating System, so you can't get everything perfect! But this operating system is really worth the buy you won't regret it trust me. With soft edged Windows and rich icon pictorials this operating system really makes digital media a lot of fun. Plus the multi-user settings in Windows XP makes it a good purchase, so everyone in the family can have their own settings without interupting other peoples files and personal settings. People have been asking Microsoft for years to merge both the ease of from 98 and the stability of NT, now they have it, why not take it. And their just too many features to talk about here! Trust me you won't regret it."

I just pulled my back-up drive, installed the new drive as a slave, used the supplied software to make the new drive the boot drive (took about 90 minutes to copy everything), installed the new drive in the C: drive position, replaced my back-up drive, and was done. All very easy."

69632,1,"SiteSpinner has truly been a life saver. I developed a web site for our non-profit organization that had several pages and information. This program was easy to use, truly WYSIWYG, and it came with everything I needed. When I ran into trouble the techsupport team and community was there to back me up. Highly recommend to anyone who has a limited budget and limited web design knowledge. You really don't need to know html or any other language to use this product.I plan on upgrading to the pro edition in order to incorporate animation this year!"
33659,1,"I can't believe how many people have written negative reviews of this product. I have had very little difficulty and have not yet downloaded the update. Just to test my premesis, I installed the program on an older HP P3 computer with XP but with less memory and speed than with my new Sony VAIO. It made a huge difference and I suspect that people having ther stated difficulties just don't have a sufficiently powerful machine to deal with this very bulky program. It is working very well for me in producing family history videos with mixed movie clips from captured video, photos (digital and scanned prints), clip art, voice over narration, MP3 overla, sound effects, etc. I'm considering starting a hobby business creating family DVD's.Good Luck!"
30232,1,"I've had so much fun with ""French for Dummies"". What I like about this program is the way that it's set up. It's just like having a language lab in your own home. ""French for Dummies"" consist of several games that teaches the learner extended vocabulary and verb terms. I really like the video clips of the speakers, which show you how to pronounce the words and phrases. One of my favorite sections of the program is the pronounciation lab, where you learn different sounds of the french language. This program would especially be great for novices and students. You learn a great deal considering the program's low price, so it's worth the money spent. Also you must have a microphone for this program. ""French for Dummies"" has an offer, in which you can purchase a headset microphone ..."

Corel Draw 11 has alienated people so much with the new enviroment and badly designed icons, that you lose your way very easily. It almost feels like I'm trying to learn a new program all over again. I have to give CorelDraw credit for creating a tool that produces certain shapes with extreme ease, but don't expect much else."
31184,0,"I've been using OSX for over a year and have gone through all the upgrades. I currently have it installed on an upgraded and accelerated iMac g3 running at 466 mhz, as well as a 500mhz iBook.I find the system stable, workable, and user friendly, although quite a bit different in feel from OS9. You have a stricter file hierarchy, that rewards putting the right folder in the right place, and retrieving your folders and applications in the same manner.I also find the system a bit slow. I have seen it at work on new Imacs and I don't find the right speed-to-system ratio until you get up to the 800 mhz, 100 mhz bus level (that means the newer G4 equipped Macs.) It is usable on G3 machines, but I have used a lot of options to turn off various graphic bells and whisltes that slow system X down.That said, hardware will become faster and cheaper (it's Moore's law), and the underlying flexibility and stability of System X make it a good bet for the long haul. It's especially impressive when hooking up third party peripherals like digital cameras. iPhoto and iTunes live up to the hype. Overall, I will keep using it and look forward to future Macs."

7838,1,"Microsoft's LiveOneCare (LOC) seems to be a good solution for ""all-in-one"" protection. I switched to this service after experiencing feature bloat and general slowdown from other anti-virus/anti-spyware suites. It runs pretty much in the background, staying out of the way of other applications. Just make sure to schedule the ""tune-ups"" away from the time you need to do other things. The virus scan is pretty slow - effective -?? can't really tell, but my machine seems to be malware free at this point. The software is still a little rough around the edges in places. There are very few parameters that can be adjusted to personal preferences and some of the report results are a bit obscure. I like too much information rather than ""sparing me the details."" LOC has pretty decent support from a users forum on-line but not much help from Microsoft itself. A couple of bad update patches caused grief for a number of users during mid-2007 but those seem to be resolved now. Overall - not bad - I am staying with LOC and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.As a nit-pick - I don't like Microsoft's new software packaging. It is a hard plastic box that presents an interesting challenge to open the first time it is encountered. Much too big for a single disk - hard to store. Hopefully recyclable material :)"

57699,1,"The previous review tagged ""Enthusiast"" with a single star, understandably because the owner couldn't get it running on Vista, but Vista must share in the blame - since its release, there have been all manner of compatibility issues. I'm successfully running it on a Mac with OS X, and it's truly remarkable. If you're interested in astronomy, this is a fabulous program that lives up to its advertising copy. I am amazed at what it brings to your desk/laptop for such a relatively low price."
57614,1,"I had PS 5.5. That is the one I learned in collage a few years back. I used it up untill a few weeks ago when my husband was rebuilding my computer and I used his. He has CS. It did take me a few days to get used to it, they made a lot of changes between 5.5 and CS. Good changes, once I got used to it anyway.It does take some learning. Dont expect to take it out of the box and be an expert. I also would like to say that dual monitors helps a LOT, mostly because its nice to have all your tools, history, layers, and brush pallets open at once while still being able to see what you are working on. To learn, I suggest finding free online tuts. I have learned many tricks just recently by reading tuts on dA... Also just play with it. Thats basicly what I did in the class I took, I learned more by just playing around then anything else.The price is really the only bad thing about CS, or PS in general. Thats why I gave it only 4 stars."

3803,1,"Lucky for me I just upgraded my pc which was 5 years old. I didn't get a top of the line one, but the server cost less than $350 w/o a monitor. I wanted to work more with video clips and my old pc really couldn't handle the video editing work. I got emc8 to manage the clips and I couldn't be happier. I downloaded the program last month and there hasn't been any updates since.Emc8 has a plug and play feature for camcorders. I could transfer footage and play around with it. The standard mode is really intuitive. For scenery clips I was able to add titles with the location and date info along with music. My camcorder is widescreen and the program has this option.I've burned several dvds for the player and even made copies with the disk copy mode. Everyone I gave them to could play them on their own players. There have been a lot of comments both good and bad in this forum, but my personal experience is that this is a great program for both editing and burning."
58528,1,"I was originally dreading the install of this software after reading many of the reviews on this website. To my surprise the install went without a hitch and I had it installed and working in MapSource on my computer within 10 minutes. To the people who didn't realize there was a code needed ""inside"" the packaging.... did you not notice the warning on the FRONT of the package saying there was a necessary code INSIDE? Also, I didn't hook my Vista HCx up to the computer until after the installer asked me to, and there were no problems detecting it. Learn how to use a computer people! In regard to people complaining about the account registration on Garmin's website - its not Garmin's fault that you failed to register your GPSr product. Paying this much money for 1.5gb of data on a 50 cent DVD, it makes me feel better that some other kid downloading illegal software won't be using my serial number to activate this program.The software functions exactly as expected and after looking back, the GPS is really ""full-featured"" now compaired to the utterly crappy basemaps that were stock. I give this 5 out of 5 stars because I'm using this on a handheld HCx unit I take hiking and biking, and for less money (than the cost of the GPS + software) you can find a Tom Tom or another unit with a much larger screen if all you care about is driving in your car with this."

I shopped around and found it here at Amazon.com with this seller that was selling it really cheap and it was in new condition! I expected to receive a beat up box, even open, but no, It was unused. Wow! I recommend this seller for their fast, prompt service and product at a real low price. Thanks!!"

53613,1,"Contrary to the previous review of this product, it DOES work with Windows ME. My computer has the ME platform, and Boggle works with it.Never have I played a ten dollar game that is so addictive. The computer game goes beyond the traditional format we all know and love to include &quot; Boggle Battle&quot;, &quot;In Your Face&quot;, and several other Boggle games as well as the classic version. Each game has the &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;master&quot; options, the master level being considerably harder than the classic mode.I would even dare to say that the computer version is better than the plastic cube version because there is no shaking and little sand hourglasses to worry about. Each and every version of Boggle on the CD is very fun, In Your Face being my personal favorite.My only complaints when it comes to this game is that the animations are horribly choppy, even on my computer, which is a fairly fast machine. I also noted that the built-in dictionary used to accept words that you find neglected to accept some of the most common English words. (I had to manually enter them into the &quot;user dictionary.&quot;)But all in all, Boggle is probably one of the biggest values in the computer game world right now."
57311,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."
40946,0,"I did a lot of homework before buying this product (my first projector). If you've done the same, you'll know this is a great projector for home theatre use - with all the right features and a lot of bang for the buck. This is all true.I sampled projectors with better/higher features and saw nothing worth twice the price. There is no doubt (unless money truly is NO OBJECT) that this is the projector to choose for home theatre.ALL THAT BEING SAID, and having read and been warned by at least a dozen reviews (of the X1) which marginalized the ''rainbow effect'' I MUST SAY THAT THE RAINBOW EFFECT IS A INSURMOUNTABLE SORE POINT and my review will focus on exactly that. I don't know if any projectors exist in the world without this problem, but here it is in a more understandable form:It seems that the picture is made of RGB images that alternate faster than the eye can notice (in other words, that there is a red image followed by a green image and then lastly a blue image - each a few dozen times per second). If you wave your hand infront of the projector very fast you can see the image break down on different fingers as different colors.A similar effect manifests when your eye moves accross the screen very fast, or if a high-contrast, highly-bright image moves across the screen very fast. You will notice three objects instead of one (red, green and blue). For example, in a largely dark scene, a light bulb will seem to have three colors if you move your eyes fast around the screen. I suspect the scene with dueling light-savers in Star Wars to be the perfect example of a bad scene for the rainbow effect - it's mostly dark and has small bright features that move fast.For me this is almost a deal breaker and I regret dropping a grand for a few features I probably wouldn't miss with an ''inferior'' projector. The problem is: I don't know what projectors there are out there that won't have this problem and have anywhere close to the performance of this one (adjusted for price)."
51209,0,"According to the specifications this product is only available for Windows 95, 98, or NT and supports just a few GPS devices. But it is based on the same program (Topo) used in National Geographic State Series, which is compatible with windows 2000, XP and 60+ GPS receivers. You only need the free Topo upgrade available at Nevertheless, TrailSmart series was created by scanning Trails Illustrated maps, so don't expect the quality of USGS maps found in the State Series. In my opinion trails don't have enough accuracy in this product (I tried Yellowstone)."
16197,2,"First off, this is the first language software that I've purchased, so I have nothing to compare it to. That said, given how highly this one is rated, I doubt I'll ever purchase language software of this type again.The software itself is some of the worst I've used. It looks nice, but the pretty icons don't make up for the utterly confusing interface. It's impossible to tell what a button will do without hovering over it with the mouse to get a tool-tip; the tabbing through the exercise forms is hard to follow, slow, and confusing; options I would expect are unavailable for no clear reason. Also, for some reason, it isn't possible to type the non-english characters (&aacute;, &iacute;, etc.); instead, there are a series of buttons at the bottom of the screen that you have to click for each of these letters. Needless to say this is very slow and incredibly annoying.As for the learning program itself, another review had it right: this is nothing but a bunch of exercises. It does little to actually help you learn the language, other than brute force repetition of the exercises. The activities will ask you to line up associated words, conjugate verbs, make nouns plural, etc., without any introduction, help, or translation. There is a help button for each item, but unless you already know some spanish, you have to click for each and every word to get a translation, memorize it, and then do the activity - this is exactly what these programs are supposed to avoid (I thought). The verbal recognition exercises just read off phrases displayed on the screen; there is no test for comprehension, and no translation to tell you what is being said.I didn't find the audio CDs to be any better, taking eight disks to cover what I already learned in a few hours listening to a spanish podcast (which is free), and in a much less interesting way. I may get some use out of the practice dialog tracks, but that's not much value out of the whole package.This program might be useful to some who need a refresher from their high school classes, but for learning spanish this is horrid. I'd highly recommend starting with one of the spanish podcasts that are available for free online - I've been listening to Coffee Break Spanish, and have learned more from those, and much more easily, that this would provide. Don't waste your money."

16763,1,"I see a lot of complaints about this product regarding the outdated information. These maps are U.S. Geological Survey maps sets. Grant you, yes they were compiled from data such as aerial and ground surveys that are dated. That said, these are accurate maps of the areas they cover, these include monument markers that are THE reference for surveyors. These maps can be updated by the user with a GPS which gives one the capability of adding roads, trails, markers to your map sets making them a personal experience. No, these are not for someone that just wants a ready to use road/trail map. In other words, these are great for trailblazers, not followers."
87433,1,Fabulous!I have owned this program for years. My own children loved it. I have gone back to work now and I use it in my preschool classroom. The kids adore it. It has numerous activities that help with everything from letter recognition to phonemic awareness and from mouse control to how to use how to use a telephone. It has funny zany activities the children never seem to tire of.

1530,0,"This latest version of Microsoft Outlook is definitely an improvement over the 2002 version. It took a while to install (at least 15 minutes), but it booted up fine after that and imported all of my existing messages and settings without a hitch. Yes, most of the improvements do appear to be cosmetic, but I can say that the junk mail filter is truly improved. A hundred dollars worth? Maybe not quite that much. But all in all I would say this is a worthwhile upgrade from what I can tell.To address some of the issues I have heard, I am using Windows XP Professional and have Office 2000 Profressional (I had previously updated Outlook to 2002). My existing office suite works without any issues whatsoever. No re-installations, no problems at all.OK, so my only gripe, and the reason for dropping not one, but TWO - yes TWO - stars is the absolutely most awful packaging in the history of all packages. First of all, it's about two inches thick and is made of solid plastic. With no manual and a CD that's less than 1 mm thick, well - you do the math. There's just no reason for it. Plus - I think I'm a fairly smart guy, but oh my goodness was this thing ever impossible to get into! Peel the side label off - that part was easy enough. But then there was a top seal that was near impossible to remove, and then a pulldown section that doesn't pull down at all until you squeeze two obscure side tabs. And then, if getting into the thing wasn't bad enough, there's a required product key that I swear is welded onto the inside of the plastic case. No joke, you can't remove it. So, even if you want to get rid of this monstrosity of a package, you can't because you need the product key sticker which you literally can't remove from the box. I wrote down the product key and threw the whole plastic nightmare in the trash. But I wasn't happy about it, I can tell you that. What an incredible waste. I guess Microsoft hasn't jumped on the whole Global Warming / Save The Environment bandwagon yet. When you have that much money, I guess who cares about a little thing like the earth.Other than that, a decent piece of software."

65147,1,"The Encyclopdia Britannica was first published in 1768 and still remains the best scholarly volume of knowledge available, and now at a breathtakingly cheap price. Subsequent editions of the Encyclopdia Britannica took decades to update but the tome would double and triple in size each time. In 19th century the Encyclopdia Britannica had gone from 1 book to 20. By the first decade of the 20th century the Encyclopdia Britannica had grown to 29 with over 40,000 articles.In the course of the 1950s the Encyclopdia Britannica established a worldwide editing team to give the publication global representation. This era of the Encyclopdia Britannica is widely regarded as one of the most expensive and work demanding investments ever undertaken for a publication. Over 4,000 scholars where assembled for this project.During the 1970s until the 1990s the Encyclopdia Britannica went through restructuring into different categories to make the articles easier to access. The finalized version (1985-present) consists of a 32 volume set and is the one that this software is based on.The next major transformation took place in the early 1990s when the Encyclopdia Britannica took advantage of the CD-ROM revolution. The digital technology innovators claimed that the new data storage medium could be compared to containing the entire Encyclopdia Britannica on one disc. The Encyclopdia Britannica was released on one disc becoming one of the most popular software packages available on the new CD-ROM format.Along with providing one of the most comprehensive Encyclopdias available for computers, the Encyclopdia Britannica hosts the domain Britannica on the Internet.Even though the Internet revolution offered considerable challenges to the Encyclopdia Britannica, such as Google's search engine capabilities, Wikipedia the free on-line Encyclopaedia, along with Microsoft's Encarta software, the Encyclopdia Britannica still has a powerhouse collection of articles that are edited by a staff of academics that are specialized in each field. You are guaranteed quality information. This makes the Encyclopdia Britannica a dependable resource for anybody who just wants to get their facts about the world right. Journalists depend on it, as do researchers and students alike.The Encyclopdia Britannica has over a whopping 100,000 articles to read.The Encyclopdia Britannica, for the full experience, takes up 4 GB of drive space. It is still on one disc although the medium is now a single DVD and not a CD. Even on high-end machines the Encyclopdia Britannica can take quite some time to install, so be prepared to wait around while 4 GB of data extracts onto your computer. The Encyclopdia Britannica software runs like a web browser and resembles Apple's Operating System widgets. Quickly the Encyclopdia Britannica becomes a workspace. You can browse timelines, view the atlas, or explore popular events. There is a nice brainstormer, powered by TheBrain software, which allows you to go through huge sections of material by category, very rapidly.The Encyclopdia Britannica A-Z is always going to stand out as the reason to own this package. The material is just so well presented in terms of the quality of English, layout and the vast array of support material including graphics, videos, many of which the user can interact with. The search feature not only pulls up direct articles, but also one's linked to it, images and a book of the year list.There are a few downsides but they are minor. One is that the package is the equivalent of opening up several intensive web pages over a web browser. If your system hangs or slows down considerably if you open up lots of new tabs or windows with content heavy pages, then you can expect the Encyclopdia Britannica to act the same way. It has always been a hardware intensive package and still continues to be. So make sure your PC is in order for it. The other thing is that it requires you to register or else you will be asked every time you use it with a pop-up that doesn't stop until you do. It is a little annoying. The only way to turn it off is to register. It is also nice to have the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary imbedded in the software but it is just a basic dictionary search and thesaurus and lacks any advanced power like the full version dictionary. However the Encyclopdia Britannica itself makes up for these minor quibbles.Overall the Encyclopdia Britannica does one other thing well which all others fail to do. It makes you want to read it from start to finish. Many people have done this and it is a completely viable option given that you do a little bit each day over the course of a year or more depending on how much you do. Where other Encyclopdias are for reference, the Encyclopdia Britannica almost demands to be read. You just know the experience would be time well spent.The Encyclopdia Britannica could very well be one of the most important items you could ever own. Education is the best investment you can make."

71431,1,"I have this product and have created 3 DVD movies composed of lots of slivers from lots of camcorder files. Once I got the right hardware, and once I figured out how to use PE2, this software is great. So Here's what I know. Key hardware; hard drive (speed 7200rpm!) and graphics card(64MBmin!128MB much better) plenty of RAM and good processor. PE2 (and Sony)prefers to use the FireWire connection(a sony invention) for better quality than USB2.0. I've imported 2 file formats - .VOB files taken from DVD's burned directly from MiniDV and VHS-C(analog) camera tapes (using Dazzle to burn DVD) no editing. These .VOB files look fine on computer and when disc is run on DVD player, but when ""re-compressed"" into a Movie after editing on another new DVD disc-they look poor. All movement is blurry. 2nd format-hooked camera directly into premier elements using FireWire. Quality looks same as .VOB on computer, but looks EXCELLENT even after editing. Don't know why yet. So, hook the camera directly into the computer, record the rough scenes with the right hardware and you can rock! Hours later...found the fix! DVD machine or SW used to put raw tapes on disc (for archiving) uses a different ""field priority"" setting. Has to do with interlacing. The fix: for EVERY video clip w/problem, once in PE2 you put the clip in the ""timeline"", right click, select ""frame options"", select ""Reverse Field Dominance"". All should be well. Enjoy!"

Now, with easier to learn functions and drag-and-drop ease, Flash MX can take it to the next level. You can incorporate QuickTime videos. You'll see improved workflow with more informative, easier to use menus. You can incorporate dynamic elements like never before. My personal favorites are the little touches that Macromedia made to just make the everyday tasks easier to do. Plus, the layer folders option is a stroke of genius (even if Adobe got there first). All-in-all, the first upgrade in years is well worth the wait. Also, it runs under both OS9.1 and OS10.1."

48782,0,"I have been a diehard Trend customer for a little while, and I have had no issues with their products until this version came out. Oddly, my issues with this version spilled over and fouled up the 2006 version when I rolled back. Not all is bad, but there is not enough good here to keep me in the ranks. I'll talk about the good first, then discuss the bad.I like the fact that Trend offers 3 installations per license, and this was a strong motivator for my upgrade from the 2006 version. With 2 computers immediately in use and another running a dual-boot config, the license scheme is a good option for me.Installation is smooth and painless. I never had any issues with installation and I was up and running very quickly - typical of Trend's installation process. Loading software should ALWAYS be simple and straightforward, and Trend has always provided such an experience to me.Compared to the 2006 version, the interface is visually more appealing. This is largely cosmetic.Most features of the suite are not appreciably improved, with the notable exception of the antispam component. With the 2007 edition the antispam has taken a large leap forward, in my case achieving a near 100% accuracy rate. This alone gave me serious reason to think long and hard about leaving Trend for another product.Not everything is good with the 2007 edition, however. On one system, I experienced the massive slowdown about which many have complained (the culprit, by the way, is the antivirus component). On another system, there was no issue. The system with the problem was an AMD64-based system, whereas the other was an Intel P4 system.I experienced another annoyance with the program which ultimately led me to decide on a new solution. Even though I had purchased a license and was covered for many months, about every 3 days Trend would complain that I was not registered and that I needed to submit my information to ensure that I was legal. Both of my installations were doing this, and when I would enter my email address again I would get an email from Trend that I had assumed the registration from myself and was no longer the registered user.I downgraded to the 2006 version, with which I had had excellent results, and the registration issue continued on both computers. After fighting with this for several weeks, I uninstalled from both computers and loaded up Panda Internet Security 2007.After 3-4 years of good packages and reviews, Trend let a lemon out of the lab with their 2007 edition. I cannot recommend it. While it works and it does protect the system, the issues I experienced assured that I would not be a repeat customer again."
84166,1,"1st of all let me preface this by saying Vista is not for every PC. Like every new Operating System when it 1st comes out it's designed to take advantage of the latest hardware. If you have an older system you may want to think about buying a new system and\or continuing to use XP.With that being said I have a P4@3.4Ghz, 2GB's of RAM, a 256MB ATI Radeon video card and a 250GB SATA hard drive. I also formatted and did a clean install so as not to carry over any clutter from all my prior use. Upgrading is the easy way to go but does have the potential for more problems, if you can the best way is to backup your data and do a complete install from scratch. (Yes there is a way to do this from the upgrade edition, I found one method and posted it in the discussion area).With all that being said, I had 3 issues with the install. Vista did not like my sound card and SCSI card. The sound card was easily remedied by going to the Creative Labs website and downloading the Vista drivers. As far as the SCSI card goes, it was an old card that I no longer use so I just removed it and I didn't even try to find the drivers for it. The only other issue I had was my Symantec Antivirus software was too old so I have to get new antivirus software. (Surprise, surprise, Microsoft now offers their own antivirus solution called LiveOne! LOL) Microsoft does have a free upgrade advisor on their website which should be used before purchasing the software, this will analyze all your hardware and software and let you know what your issues may be and what you might need to purchase before hand.With ALL that being said, I love Vista. On the surface I like the new ""crisp"" look of the GUI but beyond the eye candy the new security features are a welcome improvement, from sharing folders, encrypting data and firewall protection it's leaps and bounds ahead of XP. On top of that there are many great features hidden away. 2 I discovered quickly are superfetch and readyboost. You can Google the terms for the details as I don't want to write a book in this review but superfetch puts your most used apps in memory so they start quicker. The more you use an app the faster it runs. XP tried to do this but it wasn't very good at it and reboots would clear the cache, Vista does a MUCH better job with this even after reboots. Readyboost allows you to use a USB 2.0 stick as additional memory to help with the superfetch feature and help improve performance. USB sticks are dirt cheap right now and much faster than your hard drive. There are a lot of features like this ""under the hood"", stuff that isn't readily apparent but will become known after it's been out for awhile and people start playing with it and posting about it.My personal advice, if you have an older system, save your money and stick with XP. If you have a newer system or a powerhouse system it's worth the upgrade, especially if you are a ""power"" user. :-)"

47995,1,"This software is easy to use and is much better than a book. This is because Vietnamese is a tonal language, so the word ""ba"", for example, could have several different meanings depending on whether you use an ""up tone"", a ""down tone"" or a monotone. Unless you can actually hear the differences with your own ears it's very difficult to learn the nuances, which is why I would always recommend a software program such as this which lets your both see the sentences and hear them over your speakers.The only thing keeping the program from getting five stars is that you have to exit about four different screens in order to get out of the program. Also, some of the stock photos they use to identify the phrase in question are clearly not Vietnamese people or places. It would have been nice to have seen it be a bit more authentic."
33444,1,"I am not a computer person, but this software is so easy to use. I'm using this software in my afterschool program and the kids, whos ages range from five to eleven, are having a blast making everything from gift bags and boxes to placemats and pillows. Everything is self explanitory and if you do have trouble there is a tip button that covers most everything. Most importantly, the graphics are good and there are so many to choose from. This program has proven to be easy for all ages. I have certainly gotten my moneys worth"
82466,1,"One of the great, early multi-track programs of the 90's, Digital Orchestrator, never got upgraded for the 21st century. It just had its name changed to Record Producer. Turtle Beach and Voyetra started out to target at least semi-pro musicians, then changed their mind. So this program never got upgraded to accommodate VST plug-ins or the latest high sampling rates. Still, the deluxe version of this program has a beautiful, no-nonsense, intuitive interface for multitracking that also allows you to add and minutely edit MIDI (and transcribe your MIDI tracks to music notation as well). It's also one of the easiest programs for cutting and pasting little snippets of audio right in the close up track view. The built in effects are not bad and fairly easy to use, but do not include reverb. If this was 1997, I would give Record Producer Pro 5 stars plus. Alas, it's 2009 and I'm going to have to move on to something else. Somebody should buy the rights to this program and do what needs to be done to once again make it into a worthy competitor for Pro Tools and all the rest. Then I will be back!"

8596,1,"My 6 year old son has not put down this game since I bought it for his birthday. He can play for two hours at a time. As far as the game goes, it is excellent.But there are down sides to this game. No where on the packaging does it say that the game CANNOT be played without an internet connection. The manufacturer will not give me a straight answer as to why the game has to be connected to the internet to play. So I cannot take this game with us on outings or in the car because it will not run outside of our home.Also, I spent $20 for the game. Now if I want the ""entire"" game, I have to dish out an additional $8 per month to get the rest of the game. That seems quite unreasonable for a game for a 6 year old!! I thought I was buying the ""entire"" game when I bought the CD.The description also says that the parent will get emailed progress reports on how their child is doing, which is true, for the first few months. Then comes the $8/month email to keep it going. I just think that this is a bit much to ask.So my son will play this game until it runs out, or whatever happens after two adventures."
48365,1,"The Metroguide software for France is more useful than the US version. The maps seem more up to date, and, due to the difficulty of finding anything in France, much more useful.

It also seems to have up to date restaurant and attraction info for Paris and other areas."
55818,1,"I was looking for software to backup my new SATA hard drive since Ghost 2003 only works with PATA drives. Norton Ghost 9 won't do it - it doesn't recognise the hardware. NG 10 however does.Apart from that what can I say? Well, it works, and thats about all I can say for it. The software itself slows down my PC considerably and the recovery CD will only restore backups not create them. It requires activation with Symantec too.Most of all though what I can't forgive is the boring nature of all Symantec products - bland, grey and monolithic like the corporation behind them. The recovery CD takes an age to boot up, heaven only knows why I swear I could die of old age waiting for it. The data recovery process itself is mercifully quick however.If you have a choice of data backup/recovery software then choose Acronis True Image instead. It's not a resource hog, the recovery CD boots up quickly and best of all it can create backups as well as restore them, in fact you can uninstall the program after you've created the CD and just use that instead. Much better. I wonder how long it will be before Symantec swallows up it's rival?"

91555,1,"I've found the really bad reviews in this list to be... curious. Especially when the ""reviewer"" states that the software won't do certain things which I have done with it many, many times, and which is obvious and intuitive.Oh, and ESPECIALLY when the reviewer keeps mentioned, repeatedly, a specific ""competing product"" in his review. That sort of ""review"" is nothing more or less than ADVERTISING for the competing product. So please bear that in mind.This software is no longer produced by Rand McNally, and as such is no longer necessarily ""up-to-date"" (the area I live in is a high-growth area and the maps show areas as open country which are now shopping malls, just for example). If you live in an area which hasn't changed significantly in the last six years or so (like I used to) however, you won't notice that at all.It DOES print ""entire trip"" map sets...the reviewer who stated that it won't was either not capable of reading basic english, or was outright lying. What it gives you is a ""trip package"" consisting of a top-level map showing the entire route, along with a series of ""zoomed in"" maps showing each leg (zoomed to whatever level is necessary to show what you need to do). It includes your itinerary, scheduled stops, etc, etc. I STILL USE THIS TODAY.I also own a Garmin GPS, which I normally use for my on-the-road navigation these days. However, before any trip, I always plot out my information on paper, just in case the GPS happens to die on me (which did happen once with another model). It's worth pointing out that my GPS can connect to a laptop, which when running this software, will show my driving path on screen as well (or it can operate with a GPS receiver antenna without built-in navigation software as well).Bottom line... there is newer, and more ""state of the art"" software out there now. But if you have this, it's still very useful (despite what the Microsoft Marketing guys who posted here tried to fool you into thinking). If you want to spend a lot more, buy something new (but not Microsoft, necessarily!) If you need totally updated maps, buy something new. If you have a 100%-of-the-time-connected computer, just use Google Earth or NASA WorldWind or MS Earth 3D or whatever. But if you need LOCALLY-INSTALLED MAPS (which I often do when I'm traveling... in the middle of the Arizona desert, you don't get much WIFI connectivity!), this is a fine tool, even six years after it was last produced!"

Biggest problem is that audio is 3 second behind the video (audio lag) in DVD authoring, a big pain and does not appears to have a fix from Roxio support website.

61270,1,"Having not done web construction before, I was a little concerned with the fact that there wasnt alot of help and tutorials associated with this product. However, from reviews I decided to jump in anyway. Im glad I did. Though it took a bit of time to get the hang of it, I now compare it to friends products like GoLive and Frontpage and it seems a better product than all of them. I especially like how easy it is to set hyperlinks and to do image manipulation. The fact that you cant see a split screen hasnt been any great problem because I seldom do HTML writing. When I do I just jump back and forth. Great all around editor for people with limited web authoring skills but that dont need their hand held every step of the way. If you need tutorials to show you every step and dont like to think outside the box then this isnt for you."
4568,1,"I spoke several foreign languages( Spanish, Italian, German) before picking up Polish Now and I must say this is a great way to learn a new language. Every other language I learned was in a classroom setting but Polish Now changed this. Everything I needed was in one program and it was very sucessful at teaching the basics. The games and other activities provided for hours upon hours of needed practice. The amount of practice and learning that can be done through this program is immense and very interactive. I was able to learn the basics of Polish and many situational phrases very easily. From there the program lead me into the more advanced areas of learning the Polish Language and did so quite sucessfully. I would recomend this program to anyone who wanted to try and learn another language."

So I was quite excited to upgrade to Leopard. However, Leopard, while having many slick features (time machine, cover flow for search, etc.) lacks some of the things that you may have seen in an advertisements. For example, (and I know this is corny), but I was quite excited about playing with the holographic effect in ichat. Well, turns out that it wasn't included in the final version. YO APPLE, please be more up front with product changes and omissions. You can't show it off at a major unveiling and then drop the ball...makes folks think of the term ""false advertisement"".Anyhow, Leopard is still a great piece of work, but as an early adopter, realize there will be glitches. All it takes is a quick look at the support boards to see that there are numerous bug fixes likely on the way. Thus far, I've run into issues with the mail app not being able to send mail via a non .mac imap server... Hopefully apple will get this cleared up soon.Overall, lots of eye candy...but likely not the major upgrade over Tiger you were expecting...."

70762,2,"I've used Intellimover, and Eisenworld's Aloha Bob (before they were bought out) with very little trouble. Yes, you do have to reinstall the essential programs, but in the current software market you have a limited number of installs anyway...They both transferred my files, as per my directions - no problems.Laplink's product was a nightmare. It requires that the Internet Explorer programs be the same version, and if they aren't, you have to go back and update.... if the updated version is now newer than the other version, you have to go back and update both. They require that you disable all your security software. I don't know if you've ever tried to disable anything made by the wonderous Norton Products of the Symantec company, but those guys don't give up easily. Since the preinstalled security software was incompatible, THAT made the transfer not difficult - but impossible. When I decided to stop wasting my time (nine hours) and attempted to uninstall the Laplink product, I was informed that despite the fact that it had failed to run, if I didn't run it on that computer, it wasn't going to run anyplace else.Save yourself the pain. Don't buy it. Just transfer the data and go ahead and buy the essential programs again. You'll spend less time in anger management classes."

I've now used this same version for almost 3 years.I have used DNS since v.4 and this is the only version that has met my expectation - that I should be able to talk and the software will be mostly accurate when turning my speech into text! I have found no need to upgrade to more recent versions.This version makes it much easier to correct and add new words.While you can use a headset with microphone (one with the specs that will work with DNS), I choose to use a dictation device, the Sony ICD-BM1 digital recorder. I dictate into the recorder then hook it up to my laptop via USB and it translates into text. To my knowledge, this is one of the only affordable software still out there that will do this well.This version still requires that you train it by the tedious process of reading long stories as found in prior versions. It does not easily train without doing this process.I would like this version to have multiple custom vocabularies. I would use one vocabulary for research, one for my profession, and another for personal use.Still a great product overall."

17506,1,"I had several issues with the Spyder2 at first: for one, the 64-bit driver is unsigned and will not install on Windows 7 unless you hit F8 at startup and disable driver signature verification (every time you plug the Spyder in). Since Windows 7 is still in beta, this is forgivable. I wonder if the driver signature works in 64-bit Vista, which also has this requirement? Maybe it just needs to be updated for Windows 7. Anyway...Beyond the driver issues, the software setup went relatively smoothly. With the software installed, I attempted to calibrate the display, using the preset 6500K setting on the display. The process took about 5 minutes and was essentially automatic. However, the results of this calibration were not at all satisfactory - the grays went from having a slight blue cast to having a severe red cast, and I almost decided to return the Spyder right then and there. However, I decided to calibrate again using the RGB sliders, and wow! I had no idea just how off the display's default colors were!I saved the profile and all seemed well, so I exited the software.As soon as I exited, the color reverted back to that ugly red cast that was seen on the first calibration. Despite dissociating the profile from the device in color settings prior to running the second calibration, the file was still locked after the software exited the first time and apparently was not overwritten by the second calibration. It would have been nice if the software had warned about this and prompted for another profile filename instead of silently continuing.So I calibrated a third time using the RGB sliders, saved the profile under a different name, and now my display's color is nothing short of excellent.If you can get it to behave, it really is an effective device."
7906,0,ASL onCD Rom has great videos of each sign which can be repeated as often as you need and at your own pace. The explanations are also written but do not always match the video. In order to see the sign you must type in the word. You are not able to type in a description of a sign and find out what it means. This is an important missing part. The fingerspelling section is good for beginners but not for those who need practice in speed.

1298,1,"After spending days reviewing everything I could find about Small Business 2007... from the videos at the Microsoft site, to reviews from the private sector, chatting with Microsoft pre-sales to ask all my questions, 1-800-426-9400, (about 7 times over 3 days) and the reviews on Amazon, I decided to take the plunge.While reviews from some folks left me concerned about leaving Office 2003 behind after 3 years of heavy daily use, I pressed on.I was glad for the tip about cutting through the clear tape (it's hard to see its there) around the hard plastic package in order for the red tape/tab to be pulled to open the box.The install went great. Tip- if you have a previous version of Office on your machine, remove it from your system using the control panel-> add/remove programs. After the removal is complete, re-start your machine before installing 2007. (Some of the pre-sales folks at Microsoft told me 2007 would install over 2003.... wrongo!)Initiating Outlook was easy. 2007 remembered all my settings from 2003 and all my folders, sub-folders, signature files and settings and installed them intact. Very nice. (I did make a .pst back-up from 2003 and didn't need to use it. I do think however, it's a good idea to have a back-up.)I've already created some very cool graphics and training forms that I couldn't do in 2003. Probably a 'user deficit'! So I guess this bears witness to how intuitive the interface really is for me.A lot of folks are bashing the new 'ribbon' interface and talking about it functioning slowly and it being difficult to use. This is not my experience at all.I have only 512 MB of RAM on the XP OS and 2007 runs no differently than 2003.. no lag time or hour-glass waiting... even with changing between word - power point - and excel docs all open at one time. I guess it depends on what other programs you have running in the background- drawing off your RAM resources. I don't let anything run in the background except for my anti-virus program and printers. Everything else I open as I need it from my start menu. This is all in how you've configured your start up options as your computer boots.The ribbon menus are very straight forward, and with mouse over tells you exactly what everything does. Also, if you're in word and want to do something you used to do in 2003 and can't figure out how, you can type this phrase into the search field inside word -> ""Office 2003 Interactive"" (without the quotes).This will open a window in your internet browser that will have a view of 2003. You click on the menu selection or item you used to use in 2003, (right on your screen, this is why its called 'interactive') and it will show you what you need to do in 2007 to achieve the same task. That's pretty handy.All in all I'm pleasantly surprised. I feel I made a good buying choice after doing my research.My recommendation is to do your own research, and look at the videos Microsoft has available which demonstrates how 2007 is different. At least this gives you a visual.http://www.microsoft.com/office/newday/default.mspx?WT.srch=1&WT.mc;_id=DF7DDF87-E82B-4DFF-B637-7A7198470DCE(If this link gets chopped up in the post, be sure to copy and paste the whole link into your browser.)And:http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/products/FX101635841033.aspxChat with the pre sales folks.

It's clunky, slow, and does not support HTML so I keep finding myself reverting back to Outlook to send e-mail. This means that I'm not keeping track of e-mail through ACT which is a real problem.

7351,1,"My consulting business is based on time billing, and now I can bill time, invoice by email, and track conversations ALL from Outlook. If I schedule an appointment, or track my time in Outlook, I can mark the time as billable, create an entry, and the info flows directly into my accounting software.My ability to invoice by email had expired with QuickBooks, so I had switched to using PDFRedirect to print pdf files instead and emailed them. I was not eager to spend hundreds of dollars on an upgrade, when what I had was working fine until one of their updates turned off a feature I needed. Now it's not a problem, and the new solution actually works better because I can run the whole time billing side of my consulting business from Outlook.I had recently tried SugarCRM, but the open source version doesn't handle billing. Small Business Accounting 2006 has the best features of CRM, with Opportunity tracking, what's in the pipeline, etc. PLUS the best features of QuickBooks for considerably less.Unknowns: What happens at tax time?Untried: Payroll with ADPWishes: a tick mark of some kind in Outlook to show that a calendar entry HAS been sent to the accounting software for billing.ELEVEN MONTHS LATER: 1)My clients need dates to show for each item in my service invoice for their accounting - there is no way. 2)After restoring from a backup after a computer crash, all sorts of wierdness happened - previously invoiced items show not invoiced, etc. 3)I'm starting to feel tired of fighting the software. Template changes don't stick. 4)I wish QuickBooks worked with Outlook. I'm ready to go back."

Norton Antivirus 2001 will not work with XP and the 2003 Upgrade has problems; I spent 3 days making it work. Office 2000 has several problems and the best I can get from the admittedly flustered folks in Redmon is ""we don't have a fix for that.""So, my...upgrade has now cost me the price of Norton and, probably, the price of Office XP."

47178,1,"I had tried all of the ""manual"" ways of calibrating my screen that exist and could never get it right. Prints from my inkjet (HP 6980) never matched the screen perfectly. The I1 was a piece of cake to install and use. Simply put it on the screen and run the utility and about 10 minutes later, the screen profile was saved that made them match. I'm working in the sRGB space and will shortly move to Adobe RGB. This device eliminates the concern that colors won't match what I see to what the printer produces. Used it on my desktop Photoshop machine and the laptop too. It does change the overall look to be slightly less ""bright"" than my eye had picked out but the results took about 30 minutes to get used to. Highly recommend!"

1186,1,"The biggest complaint about this product is that it slows down your PC. If they are complaining that their PCs are taking longer to bootup, fare enough, it does add 10-15 seconds to your bootup, but if they're complaining that their PCs run slower after Windows has started, something else is wrong.I installed NIS 2005 Antispyware after having used System Works 2005.The install was problem free, the antivirus software re-configured itself to run with my new purchase, and both products sit happily side by side.Adaware and spybot are bollocks. All they do is list millions of irrelevant and harmless cookies, all of which could be removed just by deleting your cache and cookies in IE or Firefox. When it comes to real spyware, Adaware gets a bit, Spybot nothing.The best free anti-spyware product is Microsoft Anti-spyware, which even has the distinction of removing trojans that anti-virus programs can't remove.The best commercial product is a virtual tie between Spydoctor 3.2 and Spysweeper 4.0. Spydoctor is slighty better, in that it removes commercial keyloggers, something no other package can do. In fact most don't even report their existance on your PC. None of the free antispyware products block spyware at all, which both of these do very well, in fact if you install them on a clean system, the chances are you'll get almost no spyware of any consequence.The only all in one solution that works is Norton, and has one huge advantage over the rest. No false positives.No huge lists of harmless cookies, 90% of which you setup yourself when logging into shopping or banking websites, and all of which don't need anti-spyware software to remove.It isn't as good as Spydoctor or Spysweeper, nor is it as good as MS Antispyware beta, but along side the free product from MS, it is solid.The only disadvantage it has is the time it takes to scan, way too long, but as I bought this mostly for it's firewall and antivirus protection, this isn't a problem.Infact I intend to turn off it's antispyware functionality and rely on Spydoctor and MS Antispyware (along with extremely limited use of IE - with regular cookie deletes, at least with Firefox, software can't be remotely installed on your PC, IE provides direct access to the OS, and therefore direct access to your computer).So my PC is running just as fast, no slow downs, everything is fine. As it was a clean build 3 days ago, and with new antispyware and antivirus software, a proper firewall (not that windows crap) and careful surfing I expect to be largly problem free for the next 6 months, by which time the mandatory system rebuild will be due (takes six months for a PC to slow down, which is probably what is happening to these idiots complaining about NIS, and is unavoidable no matter what software you use)."
78593,1,"I'm reviwing this product in comparison with Windows XP 32-bit, the operating system I've been using for years and still do at work. I reject Vista, which seems practically unusable for an advanced technical user.One of the things that bugs me about the x64 version is that the 64-bit version of Explorer doesn't support 32-bit extensions - some of which I used frequently. I understand this is a technical limitation, so I'll just have to hope that someday the creators of the software I use frequently will eventually develop 64-bit extensions. There's a way to force use of the 32-bit Explorer by default, but in doing so, the Control Panel becomes pretty much inaccessible except from the Start menu, which is still running the 64-bit Explorer (since most Control Panel items are only available in the 64-bit Explorer).I like to organize my ""Program Files"" folder. However, Windows XP x64 wants all 32-bit programs to go into the new ""Program Files (x86)"" folder, meaning I'll have some programs in the ""Program Files"" folder and some in the ""Program Files (x86)"" folder, which disrupts my organization. For most programs, it can work to change the default install folder to ""Program Files"", but in some cases, Windows (or the installer) overrides your decision and installs to the ""Program Files (x86)"" folder anyway.There are other anomalies here and there that I can't easily figure-out and were never a problem with the 32-bit version, but these are usually small annoyances if any.Otherwise, it's pretty much what you'd expect from XP. It's a pretty solid and usable Microsoft operating system. Easy to install."
7962,1,"My primary motivation for going to 10.5 is the improved Parental Controls, however I also like Spaces and File Preview.

If you are 10.3 or earlier, you should stongly consider 10.5."

Outrageous...Well done to Open Office, who have brought out the first beta for OS X, but I hope Star Office will also bring it out too, with perhaps a more sophisticated version.

The Quick Start menu, the Recipes Palette, for starters don't work unless you change your mouse settings to right-handed. This is something Adobe could have easily corrected with a patch. I searched all over the Adobe web site, but alas! there doesn't seem to be a patch. It may be corrected in version 2.0, but if you already have version 1.0 you'll have to buy the newer version to get the fix, if there is one. None of the books about Photoshop Elements including the book that comes with the program mention the left-hand problem. I spent hours installing and re-installing the program until I found out about the leftie problem in Adobe's knowledge base. I will probably keep the program but I don't have kind thoughts for Adobe."
60252,1,"A REVIEW FOR THOSE NEW TO GNU/LINUX (experienced SuSE users please ignore)It has been a long haul... and we are just getting started. With the release of Half-Life 2 at the end of 2004 it was time to get a pippin' new PC. If we went high-end with our PC update then, you timed it well. Now we can sit safely and wait for the release of a GFX card with 1G of Ram and PCIe slot. Then we will splash out on that PCIe mobo (motherboard) and get a dual-core Processor for our next upgrade. That will probably be around 2008. We still have plenty of time for that $700 upgrade. Hopefully you have a less than 1 GHz PC that is greater than 200 MHz sitting in the corner doing nothing. We can put that to use in a moment. I previously had experience in the late 1990s of booting Linux Mandrake instead of Windows 3.1 on an old 386. It was nice, but no software, so it came off the system quite quickly. If I had the foresight back then I would have kept it on the 386 and learned the Linux manual with it. Then again we where all told that next to Apple OS, IBM's OS/2 was the competing OS to learn. As of the last quarter 2005, OS/2 is officially deceased and for all intents and purposes Apple is running a brand of FreeBSD (based on BSD UNIX) called OSX. In the mid 90s running Windows 95 was the jump to 100 MHz systems later upgrading to Windows 98 for more functionality of the Windows OS, though there where plenty of boxes still running Windows 3.1. Windows 95 plus a good video card (with broadcast ins and outs like the Miro DC50) and these faster Intel processors effectively put SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc) and MIPS processors under pressure (MIPS went bust), including pushing the Apple series of high end video editing systems like the $100,000 Avid into a corner. By the end of the 90s Windows and Intel had proved to be a considerable might for all their shortcomings, namely the BSOD (Blue Screen of Death) phenomena. BSOD problems where improved by choosing the more stable Windows NT, but where not solved completely and NT did not support all Windows software, especially games. Then Windows 2000 appeared, a hybrid of 98 + NT, proving to be a more solid operating system. At this time, in the year 2000, I booted SuSE 7.2 on a partition with MS Windows 2000 before the release of XP in the fall of 2001. The result caused me to learn that dual-booting from a single drive is not something to take lightly. This is the first lesson in Linux to learn... and learn it well. If you choose to dual-boot a Windows Linux machine, then get two hard drives for it. Trying to partition a drive to use Windows and Linux is an experiment that requires quite a bit of experience with BIOS settings and formatting drives. Even if you have two separate drives the choice of formatting the right drive is practically blind because Windows does not use the same drive labelling as Linux. However by trial and error you can eventually manage to install Windows and Linux on separate drives. As for the boot loading program, most would advise choosing LILO over a Windows boot loader and to write LILO to the MBR of the drive, but maybe trying to create a LILO boot loader on floppy first is a good idea before you decide to write the loader to the MBR (Just insert disc to boot Linux). To understand how this experience with SuSE went, let us jump forward to 2006.Year: 2006256mb graphics cards, LCD monitors on the cheap, DVD-R media, Broadband, AMD offering $1,000 dual-core processors, Apple now supporting Intel chipsets, 2GB of RAM, no problem. Windows XP2 is very stable and Microsoft announced Windows Vista for the fall of 2006. Let's just try a quick comparison between XP and Linux. XP2 has the games and Linux not, so we can stop there. Don't boot Linux if you want to play games. For speed on an OS, well Linux is a much faster than XP. Why not Apple? Well Apple is really not competing with Microsoft, but worrying about the kind of market share that Linux has taken from it. A 450 MHz machine can just about run XP, but as for Vista, no chance. So now we have a machine that can not use the latest MS OS on the way in, so now is a good opportunity to turn that box into a dual-boot XP Linux machine to add to the home network. After using Mandrake I started to use SuSE because it appeared to be one of the most popular brands of Linux. It was easy to install and I found it functioned quite well with a lot of documentation to read through. XP2 + SuSE on a removable hard drive seemed ideal for learning Linux which is akin to learning UNIX on the cheap. I removed SuSE from my system because I did not want to pay for an upgrade from 7.2 to 9 so I started to research about FREE LINUX DISTRO. I found and installed Slackware instead of paying for a new SuSE because it was free to download from the internet and had a large community of users for support on IRC. Slackware comes in 4 CDs. You should turn off your PC and boot from CD1. Set your system's boot configuration during start-up to boot from the CD. Now you MUST load the right kernel. There are loads to choose from. Find the right kernel that can find your hard drive hardware and you are in business. Slackware crudely does this and is often the top reason for Slackware installation failure. Then you must `cfdisk' and format a drive from a DOS type command prompt. If you can not `cfdisk' or issue any hardware commands that it is probably the wrong kernel you are using. Find the kernel on the CD (F2, F3 and then type 'x.s' where `x' is the kernel you need; listed), `cfdisk', after you have setup a boot partition (CD1 + CD takes up 1.3GB!!!! although less selection of software minimizes this but do not minimize. Slackware comes with Zipslack on CD4 for specialist mini-Linux installation), `setup' next and you are into the Slackware installation. Next is the `addswap' in the installation to include the Linux partition, `targets', `source' media, `install' configuration and you are ready to install. The package runs and asks you for CD2, install that and then the installation will end asking you to install a mouse, forget the network unless you are on one (you can install it later). Login after start-up as the legendary `root' and the password you gave on installation. You will see a command prompt. This is what all your trouble was for. That command prompt is almost like UNIX using mostly UNIX commands, so immediately you can start learning UNIX (Like advanced DOS) commands. Cool. But type `startx' and you get a Linux variation of the UNIX xwindows, that runs as a graphical user interface with folders and copy and paste (just like that W word program) and you are free to explore that. Anyway click the K in the KDE menu below and click the `command prompt' icon, now type `xterm' and you got the command prompt window pop-up inside KDE, haha, now you can see how Linux is quite interesting, you can issue UNIX type commands from this `bash xterminal'. Stick CD3 and CD4 in and copy them over (you will learn something called `mounting' here) and they contain extra software packages that you can use at a later date. Now learn Linux by reading and doing all that is contained in the books on CD3. That is what it is all about. Learn all of it inside out over the next few years by booting Linux in your spare time, reading the manuals and trying to do what they are talking about. If you feel that you would like to learn more then it is the time to consider paying for a Linux distro like SuSE, but until then why not just learn Linux first for free. The key is to learn GNU/Linux this way until as such time as you can do everything from the `bash' xterm window. Then go BUY yourself a fully privileged SHELL account from a UNIX provider, command that terminal from any PC of your choice, using the shell terminal to command any other legal terminal of your choice, from anywhere in the world. That is what it is all about - Learning Global Commands and Systems. Learn about Linux Servers (the main reason to run Linux) and keep reading. I hope this helps keep a dying PC alive a lot longer and will help prevent people from shelling out lots of money on an expensive Linux distro when they might be doing better starting out with some free distro first.Notice I have called Linux, GNU/Linux. I learned this by using Slackware. GNU is a set of UNIX-like programs that run on the Linux Kernel. Without GNU, the Linux kernel is useless and without the Linux Kernel we would be using a poorer version of the GNU Kernel. That is why the correct name for this OS is GNU/Linux. Something these pay-for distro should be stating more clearly. Also Mac has been hacked to boot GNU/Linux. So if you buy a MAC you can boot Linux of it. Not only that but OSX has been hacked and ported to the non-Mac PC. Anyway just consider FREE DISTRO and don't believe any hype about needing to shell out money to run GNU/LINUX. It was always meant to be FREE. Most of all remember, have fun.(Note: SuSE is worth every penny if you do choose to buy it because it has a GUI installer and is easy to setop. It may even be the best distro that costs money. Just don't believe the ""PAY FOR LINUX-Only"" crowd who think GNU/Linux should not be FREE. Shame on them.)"

93586,1,"I'd used previous versions of Norton Internet Security in the past. This time around, largely because of some of the more negative reviews you will also see from some other folks, I decided to try something else. I purchased Computer Associates eTrust Internet Security Suite, and hated it to death. The program did not work well, was a terrible install, and had abysmal technical support. I therefore decided to bite the bullet and buy the latest version of Norton again. I am truly pleased with the result. The application simply works very well and contains a high degree of user customization, if you want to use it. I can easily apply different settings for my wife, my kids, and myself. The protection offered is comprehensive, and I've had no issues with security. In addition, N.I.S. does a far better job of spam blocking, etc., than the software provided by my ISP (Earthilnk), which costs (and is worth) nothing.I think the key to avoiding issues is to uninstall other legacy internet security or antivirus utilities you may have before installing NIS. By doing so, I had a very straightforward, clean, successful install.Having tried several other options, I recommend this product very highly."
24771,1,"- and a minor one for new features. I started out with Fusion MX a couple of years ago and upgraded on the day I got the offer.The user interface is greatly improved, as is stability. In fact it is an effective package for creating AND maintaining even complexly structured web sites. My two primary sites are 150 and 50 pages, and changing the structure is easy and effective.The few downsides are un upload (ftp)-feature that does not allow only to upload truly changed pages, and that large clunks of Excel data will make the files unstable. Or maybe I just I haven't found the way to do it right. The database-facility is rudimentary. The final point is that the html files produced should have been leaner.I actually enjoy working with Fusion 7 because it is heavily focused on getting the job done, and it does it, and very nicely, too!Much appreciated and heavily recommended."

43832,1,"I like the license for this product (you can install this on up to 3 machines, which is great now that my kids ""need"" office software for school projects).I am still not a big fan of the ""Ribbons"", which are the user interface tools that Microsoft Office now uses instead of menus and toolbars. If you were proficient at a previous version of Office, the Ribbons are NOT as intuitive as they would have you believe (it is a strange feeling, to be sitting there thinking I know exactly what I want to do, but I can't find the command). The ribbons are not as customizable as the old menus and toolbars were in previous versions. I believe that I will get use to them and I would guess that a new user would have no problem with them.Aside from the Ribbon bars, the rest of the suite seems very similar to previous versions that I am familiar with. I don't think that I would purchase this as an upgrade, but this was good for me because I did not previously have a personal version of Office (only had it on my work machine)."

35269,0,"Should you upgrade? Well, kind of, I tend always upgrade to the latest from Symantec. For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to ""Norton Anti-virus 2005"", the programs from Symantec such as System Works and Utilities are just the same, no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and the obvious bloat of it. Doesn't even include features your getting for free in Windows like a FireWall, which comes free with SP2 for Windows XP. The introduction of technology such as Activation was not smooth, and caused a lot of headaches which only makes the product less embracing than it use to be.Symantec needs focus on areas such as Speed, Seamless Integration with Windows, obviously it has lost it. My next purchase from Symantec won't be in the retail line, but from Enterprise space. The Corporate Edition of Norton Antivirus, it offers all the tools I want for protecting my PC, yes it cost a lot and its targetted towards the Large Networks, but it is so subtle and easy to use and it does not bog down your PC.So, should you upgrade?If recently purchased System Works 2004 or Norton 2004 or any of the Symantec line of products at least wait until your one year subscription is up. Because that's what you buy a utility program for, to keep updated against the latest attacks."

89279,2,"I've had Parallels Desktop for Mac for a few weeks now. For the most part, it works very well. When booting or shutting down, it pretty much ties up the Mac, but that isn't the end of the world. What was very disappointing is that the program does not recognize the Express Card slot. I have a Verizon air card in there and I take my Mac around to do demonstrations that REQUIRE the Windows version of Internet Explorer.Okay, that's also not the end of the world, but I really wanted some help on this and like other reviewers here, reading through their manual and FAQs, I was somewhat snowed by technical jargon. The effort to make their educational material understandable to the ""rest of us"" simply wasn't present. Initially I was not able to find in their materials that the Express Card was not supported, so I tried to contact them for help.So I emailed them. And waited their obligatory 72 hours. Then emailed again. 72 hours later, I emailed them again. After one more block of 72 hours, I was finally convinced they wanted me to pay the $30 for a phone ""incident."" I paid it. Then I called and got their answering machine. Left a detailed message. Two days later and no return call, I called back. Same thing. Machine, left message, no return call. After a week of this, I called American Express and asked for the $30 to be returned to my card due to non-delivery of the service.They've got a product that has many strong points. But someone in an executive capacity at Parallels has to realize you just can't ignore your customers on tech support lines. Well, I guess you can, but then realize the fact that more and more of us will post reviews like this and eventually that erodes sales."

Using the basic mode cannot be easier. Although the video and audio in the capture screen are out of sync, the finished product (DVD) is perfect. The advanced mode is more time consuming but if you follow the directions, the program performs as advertised. After reading the negative reviews I was somewhat hesitant to purchase the product. However, after using it, I recommend it highly. Check the system requirements before purchasing. I suspect that accounts for some of the problems experienced by other reviewers."
76872,1,"We used the maps of Italy during our recent trip to Italy. Rented a car in Milan, drove to Lake Como and then to the Piedmont area. It was fabulous! Driving up the narrow mountain roads into Serralunga, all around Alba and other small towns would have been a major challenge without it. We went off course a few times, but the system brought us right back to the correct route. I had printed out Google Maps, but didn't even use them since the Garmin worked so well. Had no trouble understanding the pronunciations.We highly recommend purchasing it if you are going anyplace in Italy. It's worth its weight in gold."

2253,2,"CS2 appears to have been released prematurely with minimal, if any, quality engineering. Bugs are rampant and the ""complimentary"" technical support is on the same par as the program itself.In fact, I wonder if many of the support people are experienced Photoshop users themselves. They appear to be non-technical individuals who are capable of reading support documents but the average person can access these for themselves on the Adobe website. Beyond the documents, support personnel have little to offer beyond denial, which is extremely frustrating given the myriad of problems with this release of Photoshop.I would strongly recommend staying the course with PS7 or CS. The new features, including Bridge, are not worth the hassles involved with basic functionality of CS2. Many features that worked fine in CS do not function well, if at all, in CS2.Apparently, Adobe is more intent on integrating Photoshop with it's so-called Creative Suite than it is in maintianing basic functionality of what used to be a great program.I would suggest either sticking with PS7/CS or perhaps waiting for the trial versionof CS3 to arrive. Hopefully, Adobe will clean up their act."
47457,0,"As a correction, I will briefly say that &quot;diga&quot; is the correct way to answer the telephone. In fact, &quot;diga&quot; is in the dictionary, but it is a conjugate of the word &quot;decir,&quot; meaning to speak. Just like &quot;does&quot; may not appear in our dictionary because it comes from &quot;do&quot;. Please do not hold this against the program, because they are correct. However, it may lack in explaining the pertinent information on why one word is used instead of another."

69911,1,"I've never used a GPS unit before, but with a two-week driving trip to the UK coming up, I thought it would be a useful tool. I was wrong; it was an INDISPENSIBLE tool. We got the UK map add-on, popped it in and we were ready to go. We changed it over to the British voice for fun and was a god-send. Seriously, if I could give this thing 10 stars I would.It saved my life on numerous occasions and lowered the stress level of driving in an unfamiliar country (on the left side of the road, with roundabouts instead of intersections, driving late at night and on rural roads!) to a minimum.One time we ran into some emergency construction work in Cardiff and we were unable to turn where it was directing us. However, it recalculated quickly and we arrived at our destination only a few minutes later.What I wanted was something to get me from A to B in one piece with a minimum of stress. This did the trick and then some. Considering that without this map we would STILL be wasting our vacation time arguing over paper maps and missed turns and trying to figure out the unfamiliar UK road system this little guy was worth twice the price I paid for it."

94337,1,"When I discovered the TurboTax software 3 years ago, it seemed to me like the answer to a prayer, and a gift to the American taxpayer! The purchase price was very low, compared to professinal tax preparation services a fraction of the cost! Rebates and other incentives are usually offered, and state income tax filing is included. With Intuit's TurboTax Deluxe much of the work of filing your federal and state tax returns is done automatically. If I have any tax questions, help is available either directly from the Tax Library from within the program, and offers tax info, tips, changes of tax law, and links, or online. Data entry is easy, I just fill in the blanks! In my opinion, this program ought to be subtitled, Filing Tax Returns for Dummies...or so. Installation of the program is very easy and straightforward. The software comes with a detailed step-by-step guide."
53562,0,"I got this product with my Asus M/B. I also got PC cillin 2000 with my old Asus M/B which I used until I got Norton Works 2002 at which point my HD was wiped clean by the A-hole virus(don't know the real name) Now with my new M/B I will only use PC Cillin despite it's lack of support for certain websites(many official ones), such as the Asus website, and many gaming co sites. I get the &quot;Active X cannont load BS onto computer&quot; error message, but I think it is worth it to keep my $3100 computer from Falcon running properly."
57504,1,"If you computer is old and you want an all in one AV suite you got two choices. Trend Micro PCcillin or Kaspersky's Internet Security 7. I have tried everything on the market but McAfee and my customers have had problems with that one!I've tried Kaspersky's and it seemed effective but the popups will kill you if your not an experienced user, and it is super expensive also. No thanks - I'll take this old reliable to anything on the market. Some of the features seem flakey or ineffective and I will tip my hat to that; but bottom line is I have tested this in a combat field environment and have not had a major infection yet.Before installing ANY antivirus product make SURE the previous one is FULLY uninstalled. This in itself will be a chore if you have Norton, because you will have to run their uninstallation cleanup even after you get rid of it and you still won't get it all.Next be sure and do a Trend Micro ""Housecall"" online scan to make sure you clean all the baddies Norton and the other junk left behind. I do not recommend using this instead of installing AV ware because the new bugs out there are getting more NOT less sophisticated. Trend's IS 2006 is the minumum you will get away with for a while until it is discontiued and that is the subject of a whole other discussion.. You might get away with using Avast or AVG but you wouldn't have the cool features that IS 2006 comes with!If you don't trust Trend's firewall don't install it with the suite - they give you the option to do this but you will not be able to use the anti-phishing feature that it gives to Internet Explorer 6. If you are using IE 7 you probabley won't need it but the bad website blocking will still work without the firewall installed. DO NOT try to blow past this good feature as this is what makes up for having older AV software! Bad web site blocking will keep you from picking up the worst malware that can takeover a computer using every exploit known to man.Be sure to go to their /download/engine.asp page to get the latest scan engine and update to the newest version of IS 2006. This page is hard to find so use Trend's chat service to get the information if you can't find it(have your license key ready). DO NOT upgrade to 2007 unless you have 2Gb of RAM. All new AV suites hog huge RAM processing space..Last but not least don't rely on one suite fits all to completely protect your computer this solution is the minimum. Some people swear by Spyware Doctor another RAM hog or Spysweeper another RAM hog. But Spybot Search and Destroy gets along famously with IS 2006 and will get you buy until you can afford a new computer with HUGE RAM!There are many good utilities you can add to this to enhance your security but DO NOT use two firewalls together and two antiviruses together, THIS DOES NOT WORK. Anyone you tells you different doesn't have enough experience to know any better. I wish there was enough space and time to give folks who have older computers more advice but I would probablly get kicked off Amazon for boring you with the details. Happy SAFE computing!P.S. To tell you the truth I am using this suite only because of the privacy data protection. As soon as Agnitum gets their firewall version of this perfected I will switch to them. At that time I might go with free Avast or Avira for an AV suite."

57448,2,"After years of sticking with the Norton family of products and their enormous drain on system resources, I made the switch to PC-Cillin with their 2005 version and removed every trace of Norton. I was extremely impressed--it was finding things that Norton didn't, and my computer was running faster than I'd ever seen before.When my year of updates ran out, I eagerly upgraded to the 2006 version. I was impressed with the great new features and sharp improved interface. Unfortunately, I also noticed an instant drop in the speed of my system. Everything--not just internet--is now at a crawl. It freezes up at least once a day. Looks like I'll have to find a new brand for my antivirus/internet software next year."

But, as the ownership has changed, their focus on revenue means that customer service is short changed. You will never get through to customer service. If you call, you will be put on interminable hold. They will never return an email and there is no mechanism to leave a return phone number. So, if you have problems, you are on your own."

68431,1,I use Photoshop Elements 5.0 almost daily and have been using Elements since version 2.0. It is the best version for casual photograhpy since there are so many quick fixes and corrections the user does not have to know the finer adjustments like levels and the use of filters. As one becomes more adventous of desires to make more advanced alterations Elements provides a exceptable help files.The one fault I have is the addition of the curves adjustments. These are not what I expected and still fall well short of the full version of Photoshop CS2. I am glad there are other ways of getting the same results though other tools.I highly recomend the product for those who cannot afford nor need all the features of Photoshop CS2.
57851,0,"At $14.99 this is best deal you'll find at your local software retailer. However, this is not the best deal to be had. I purchased this product, went though all the forms and ended up with a return of $233. Confused (sure that wasn't right) I went though all the steps again only to get a return of $1978! When I went to e-file I had another surprise waiting, the software had to be updated before I could e-file, because &quot;this product shipped before the final child credit forms were ready&quot;. This was a painless step (just selected &quot;update&quot; from one of the menus and waiting for it to download), but once it did finish I was now left with a return of $744.Now, angry and looking for a second opinon I went to www.turbotax.com, their website allows you to enter all your tax information for FREE (does the exact same thing as this software only much better), anyway TurboTax's website confirmed the $744 return for me, but they also gained a customer for next year. You only pay turbotax.com when you e-mail and that's $19.99 (same price you'll pay for TaxCut to e-mail, but with TaxCut you have to pay $14.99 for their software.So while this is a good deal, it's not the best and I think their wizard could be a bit more intuitive."
63616,1,I thought that this was one of the greatest softwares I had Bought after Photoshop 5. THat was untill photoshop 7 came out. Personally I would skip the savings and go for the good stuff with Photoshop7. Almost the same as 6 except that there is a history function that allows you to go back as many steps as you need. There are an uncountable amount of new features that are so easy to use I was blown away.
30966,1,I am soooooo happy. I had this software but my puter crashed and the backup I had made of the original didn't work. Glad to have this back again as I love all the features this software offers!! TYTY!
42268,1,I had a real laugh learning this product. I think it's a real must have for any research. It really helps out.
88591,1,"Work extremely fine with system commander y2k. Well, you also get a BootMagic from Powerquest, but in my opinion, the system commander is the best one so far, while PartitionMagic is the No.1 in partition utility.

70447,1,"This program allows me to effortlessly create simple and complex databases, and expand their functionality in numerous ways (if only I had the time to do the latter!). Extremely versatile, easy to use, a hit with all my clients. When I get people to respond with &quot;this is so exciting&quot; about a database package, I know that something's up. Filemaker had done a great job improving an already stellar package. Combined with the thousands of plug-ins available, make this the best investment I have made for my consulting practice."

The main point of the game is to go from film shoot to film shoot to build an action stunt movie and you, Pepper, are the main stunt man!

I am glad I spent money on it, because it is very enjoyable and addictive."
57423,1,"After switching from McAfee, I find PC-Cillin to be an adequate and competitive alternative in the world of virus scanning and Internet security. It is a little bit too ""chatty"" constantly informing me that it is doing its job.I switched from McAfee because it arrogantly assumes that since it is the king of the hill in virus scanning, it can afford to jack up its prices and not value its existing customer base."

2356,1,Ordered it here on April 9 and my account says I won't get it until June 18th. The order page still says ships in one to two weeks. in the meantime I've downloaded the demo and it appears a great update. Now if I only had the manual that will come with my copy.
81345,2,"After years on the shelf I dusted off the original version of 3D home Architect to draw some plans for a bathroom remodel. That old version ran amazingly well considering it was designed for Windows 95. Thirsting for more power, I ordered 3D Home Architect version 5.0. What a joke. This is probably the worst piece of software I have ever owned. All of the rendering capability is really neat, but when you cannot even finish a floorplan without endless complications, like pocket doors that place as double doors by default and then never return the space in the wall when you change to a single door, or like different dimensions when you automatically dimension exterior walls than you see when you try to drag a wall to edit it. I have spent an entire day with the program and have only finished the perimeter of my home. This program is a total waste, save your money."
64225,1,"This is the same program as System Suite 7. Same VCOM programs, VCOM support and utilities. Same add-ons. Same everything except this has more features that the ""new"" version eliminated - probably to market separately! It just doesn't look as ""cool"" in the simple blue box under the Vanquest label. If in doubt, just compare the two. Just wanted to let all know that, because this program can be found in electronics stores at a highly discounted price since the packaging and title was changed by Avanquest. I bought this program for fifteen on clearance at Staples. A couple of differences... This version gives you 5 licenses, not 3 that the new marketing line (System Suite 7) offers in the fancy red box. This one also offers a Home Network Setup in which you can network all your home computers to monitor them and the peripherals, such as printers, cameras, etc.BY THE WAY, A COMMENT FROM ANOTHER OVER AT MY REVIEW OF SYSTEM SUITE 7 MADE ME LOOK AT VISTA COMPATABILITY OF THIS PROGRAM.IT IS COMPATIBLE, BUT REQUIRES A FREE SOFTWARE UPGRADE. INFO IN OBTAINING THE FREE DOWNLOAD WAS FOUND IN THE BOX I PURCHASED (DOWNLOAD AT THE AVANQUEST WEBSITE).Now, onto the Review...I have never been more pleased with a Systems Program, as this one. I was ready to upgrade and if by dumb luck, I hadn't had both in my hand in the store, I never would have noticed that this and SS7 were the same. I bought this one because of the significant price difference and every once in awhile you get lucky.Installation was a breeze. I removed any conflicting programs, like my other anti-virus (a-vast! is a free program and a very good one that I knew I could download again if I wasn't happy with this one) and my old utilities program before loading this one. It has been running smoothly ever since.This thing rocks. The Firewall notifies you when another site is attempting to communicate (usually by your action in trying to connect) and if you recognize it, click ""yes"" and ""never ask again"" to avoid being bothered in the future about that particular site. (Be careful clicking ""No"" and ""Never ask again,"" as it may be safe and seeing it again is a chore to correct.) You can also monitor your Firewall to see outgoing data, incoming data, and intrusion attempts. You can also generate emails to yourself to inform you of intrusion attempts, by using notification settings in the program.The registry cleaner (it also has a registry defragger) found about 50 additional dead registry addresses I removed. The spyware program found a dozen that my Ad-aware program missed.Automatic updates notify you when new downloads are available for additional virus protection and upgrades.The Control Panel is easy to navigate and understand. Setting your preferences and choices of items to fix, optimize, change, or whatever needs to be done are simple for anyone intelligent enough to use a computer.The Hard drive failure warning is a nice feature that supposedly tells you if your hard drive is about to crap out, or on its' last legs. Don't know if it really works, but hoping I won't ever need it to. Though, wish I had it 2 months ago!Hardware Diagnostics is something everyone should have and this one performs. Again, the ability to run this on a schedule you set up is quite handy. Memory (RAM Sticks) diagnostics can take over an hour or 2 to run, depending on how much you have. Scheduling it while you sleep is great. Wake up and have your results. Of course, you can also run diagnostics of your Motherboard and other items at the same time.Optimizing my entire system has shaved another 12 seconds off my boot time - and that is after having used my previous program to do the same thing, before installing this one!Disaster recovery should be a must for everyone. One of the first things I did was make Recovery discs using this program. It comes with a bootable Rescue disc, but I wanted recovery discs on 3.5"" Floppys. If you have a major crash, you're screwed if you think your ROM Drive is going to work. Always have a Floppy Drive available! (Probably the only thing it is good for these days).Auto-save. Nice! My last program didn't do it automatically. Before I knew it, I had a ton of stuff that I had to back-up. No more worries now. It saves everything without me having to do it manually. For those of you without a second hard drive, have one installed as a slave or buy an external... save yourself the heartache in the event of a major meltdown. It happens to the best of us.Yes, many features but, more importantly, an easy user interface that everyone should be able to master in short time.For those with horror stories about this program, it is most likely:A) Used on a system that did not meet minimum requirements.B) Used on an O.S. that was incompatible.C) Failure to remove conflicting programs or close all Windows programs that were running before installing.D) A pirated disc bought off eBay or some other auction site.I recommend this highly. Nothing better - and that includes comparing it to the over-hyped ""Fix-it Utilities 7"" that has numerous bugs. Every PC should have something other than what M$oft offers in their O.S. and this is it!"

77235,1,"This software has changed my life and has sped up so many tasks with great accuracy. In comparison, I had ViaVoice 10 for several years. I finally had to uninstall it because it ran so slow, meaning the whole computer. I use technical terms and it was so complicated to get the words recognized by the software. It was like being in training with it for ever. Then a week ago I installed NaturallySpeaking 9 Preferred. This is so great. It runs fast and it is simple. The nice thing is I am able to use my headset mic from ViaVoice which is USB and it is smooth as silk and extremely fast and accurate. As for building a vocabulary, where with ViaVoice you have to pronounce each word, NaturallySpeaking simply scans all your emails and documents and pulls the words into your vocabulary. I have a brain injury so it takes me awhile to get it figured out. I guess I need to do the tutorial a few times, but that is maybe 30 minutes a time. I had no problem registering my copy. It went smooth as silk. It is one of the best things I ever got. A friend first told me about Naturally Speaking several years ago and how his son was writing these great papers for school in no time at all, and I was crawling around with ViaVoice. I should have taken a hint too, as all of the colleges and universities around here have used Naturally Speaking for years and years. A much better product. I did this intuitively and I am so glad that I did. My life is so much better because this works just like they say it does (as long as you don't slur your words but enunciate correctly)--but my grandmother used to tell me the same thing, so maybe that is why it works so well for me. Anyway, if you buy it you won't be sorry.If ViaVoice did not have IBM's name on it no one would even pay any attention to it. Plus v.10 is old. Forget it. Let it go. They simply did not develop it to the extent necessary. But Nuance did, and so much the better, man! Get Naturally Speaking but you might need a better microphone. The one that came with mine was junk, but I did not need it and I got a great price on eBay. Can't be happier that I got the sense to get rid of ViaVoice. It was like dragging around a ball and chain. Naturally Speaking is like freedom--at last! Light is coming through the windows as the ease of using it and its effectiveness makes itself better each day I use it."
4485,1,"Like some users I noticed that this application was very slow at first but after using it a few hours it became faster. I suspect it was busy indexing my pictures at first. Several of its tools are substantially improved over version 8, so much so that I save time despite somewhat slower opening and saving of files. The magic wand, for example, works so much better that I would never again want to use the one in version 8.One limitation is that it does not handle raw image files from my Fuji camera. Fortunately Fuji's own conversion tool does a satisfactory job.Corel offers a free trial of this product at their website."

33599,1,"This latest version of 4D really helps keep it up with the competition, but in terms of turning out applications for small and large numbers of users quickly, it's got to be one of the best tools on the market, especially in a mixed PC/Mac environment.Rather than being a RAD tool with a database engine bolted on, 4D is a completely integrated, database application development tool containing everything needed to create everything from single-user to large multi-user client-server systems. There's also an ODBC driver available for 4D server and 4D can act as a client to SQL and ODBC backends such as Oracle, MS SQL Server, Sybase, etc.The new webserver in 4D 6.5 now makes it far easier to produce intranet/internet applications than ever before, and it makes it far easier to let web designers do all the design work.The productivity increases with this latest version keep it well up with the competition, plus the engine speed improvements and additional internet features are an even bigger bonus. Add to that the interface improvements and loads of other new features and it's got to be the best value product ACI have ever released.4D is a great tool for any sized application from single user to 150+ with the added benefit of having even more users connecting via the webserver, all in one box. It's even got a proper machine code compiler.This package has everything you need to get started with 4D development as it comes with the compiler, plus the most popular plug-ins from ACI."

With my wide screen, the best location for the Dock is on the side, not the bottom. Overall a nice upgrade."

And if you need dynamic, database-content, you can use CodeCharge with FrontPage, which creates much cleaner database-connected sites than DreamWeaver UltraDev."

As a full-time Baptist pastor, my library is a very personal thing to me -- my books are the ""tools of my trade."" Libronix is MUCH more than just Bible software, although in my opinion it is the absolute best biblical software available. Libronix is a complete digital library system, allowing one to access from a hard drive what was previously accessed from a pastoral book shelf or a seminary library.Over the past ten years, I've been transitioning to a digital pastoral library, and Libronix is my format of choice. I've considered other popular software programs, but nothing comes close to Libronix. It has unsurpassed Biblical tools, PLUS a vast amount of reference titles and contemporary authors.One great thing about Libronix is the amount of pricing options available to get started. Although I own the Scholar's Library Gold edition (widest selection of titles in one package), a person can start with a less expensive package, such as the Christian Home Library. Don't want the Hebrew and Greek selections? You don't have to buy them. Want more contemporary authors and less classical works? Craft the system to your choice, buying only the titles you truly need.Another outstanding characteristic of Libronix is their customer service. I have NEVER in ten years had any problems whatsoever. There is also a newsgroup of users available to discuss various issues from beginning to advanced.If you're wanting to go digital in your Bible study and/or your Christian library, Libronix provides the best way to get there. I recommend this program highly. I have used various editions of it for years, and am sure you won't be disappointed."
91048,2,I am dissapointed that I cannot return this to Amazon for a full refund after trying it. The OCR is not as good as expected. It is completely usless for about a third of the cards I've tried. Fewer than 10% work perfectly. I feel I have to thoroughly scrutinize every entry because of numerous minor mistakes. My girlfriend told me not to buy it and I should have listened.
51404,0,"MovieFactory is strong on features. Menus created with it look great, and its thumbnail selection feature is ideal. The only downside feature-wise is that you have to manually add chapter points while actually watching the video (can't just fast forward on the timline to where you want to add them).This said, the MAJOR downside to MovieFactory is the video quality of the resulting DVD. I have a good system and a popular DVD drive, and other software produces great results on DVD's. But Moviefactory produced very blocky video--full of obvious artifacting. And the worst part was, the video would completely pixellate every 15 seconds or so.It's a real shame too. The features are pretty decent. But without features AND decent video quality, the software is pretty much worthless to me."
15907,1,"Really great stuff in here. MD Dundon is the best teacher ever -- I wish she taught more than Flash, because she really has a way of demonstrating and explaining that makes it stick in your head. I remembered so much from this program that my boss actually asked me if I had been practicing my &quot;Flash tricks&quot; on the weekends!I work at a production company, and after I bought this my co-workers went ahead and ordered the Dreamweaver and Final Cut from this same series. It's the best out there - the Digital Media Training Series has one a bunch of awards, and now I know why!!"
10321,1,I really like the game. What gets on my nerves is that shovel on the the math part telling me what to do. She won't give me a chance to do what I need to do. I mostly play the rhyming game with salt and paper. And I also like to find Joe.

I need basic book keeping for a side project and this fits the bill perfectly."
94225,1,"I haven't been able to use all the features on this item yet. I had Creator 4 Delux that I used to make slide show photo albums with audio tracks that worked very well except I wanted to play them on DVD. 5 Platinum was about the only affordable package that included MPEG1 encoding and, as I was already familiar with most of the features (spin doctor, take two, etc.), I went with this package and am so far satisfied.. Not impressed yet. True, the various packages could be better integrated but they are functional. When I have the Xmas pics in hand and have a chance to do a slide show on that I will know more about this.**Follow-up comments:OK,, got my Xmas pics and was able to make a Video disc from the stills that the DVD was happy with. Also found that I can make menu driven DVD's and a few other features that I hadn't expected.I also found some problems that I hadn't expected. The major one is that I cannot seem to recover changes in a saved file... ie. I create a slideshow, enter text, transition effects, audio, etc and save the file to gather more material. I reload it and the pics are there but the rest is gone... virtually have to start from scratch.. Not good!! I have come up with a few workarounds but this is a pain!! Arcsoft support seems to be non-existant... Arcsoft is the developer for this end of the suite... Roxio support is less. Maybe would be better if I went for the paid support be e-mail requests are a waste.Bottom line: The functions are there but you will need the patience of Job to ferret them out and use them, but the alternative would be to spring some MAJOR bucks for real authoring software.....Follow-up to the follow up.... The main reason I bought this software was to get Video Impression.. the MPEG conversion package.. I can make Video CD's but this is a REAL ugly baby... Everything MUST be done AND burned at the same sitting.. All the other functions seem to work OK, I have Windows Me, I would suggest Win 2K or XP users avoid this stuff. Music people with other OP systems will likely find it OK, Direct CD with Win 98 and Me worked great..."
62343,1,"I was hooked an a previous version of ""Clicks"" but the software would not work on my new computer. I ordered this CD because it had my game on it. I was surprised to find that the graphics are different and not as visually exciting as the old edition.Other than that, however, the regular Mahjonng game is great. Hard enough to be stimulating but easy enough that I can play it and be satisfied. Some versions are too easy or too hard....this one is Just Right! I would buy it for that reason alone. But I wish I could still see the chinese characters on Clicks from the earlier version."
39639,1,"This is absolutely the best FPS I have ever played! It's got excellent gameplay which almost makes it feel more like an RPG than a FPS. The graphics are not quite up to par considering it uses the Unreal engine from a couple of years ago, but the graphics are still great. The sound is fabulous. The storyline is about as well put together as a storyline gets.I recommend this game to any gamer of any genre. The level editor is also the most fun thing I've ever used. Once you get used to it you get really hooked. It's also the best game you can buy for that price. Deus Ex is definately the best game. If you don't have it yet then pick it up now."

95039,1,"I purchased this game when I was eight years old, and even then I was skeptical of how good this game could be. I assumed limited speech and set possibilities, but I was proved wrong. Today I am fifteen, and I have to admit I still can enjoy this game. There are infinite storyline possibilities, and even though the computer generated voices are not realistic, they are ammusing. I have spent many hours thinking and creating plot lines that range from the normal to the bizarre. There really is no limit in how you're play will turn out. The one problem I have with this game is that sometimes the it skips over dialouge, but that is rare. All in all this is a fun and easy to use game, and I would recomend it from the ages 6 to 12."
60731,0,"The software is really impressive but all the add ons are geared toward a more conservative christian viewpoint. Although I respect it, I don't share it. I would have ordered the smaller package and just added the books that I needed. I wished they would have indicated their leanings."

19471,0,"Installion problems --- I tried installing Paint Shop Pro 8.1 on my two networked home computers. It installed fine on one (a new Compaq running Windows XP Media center. Service Pack 2), but would not install on the other (an older Compaq running Windows XP Home, Service Pack 1).On the old machine the installation stopped almost immediately on an error telling me to contact Microsoft. I tried deleting all file and registry references to a demo version of Paint Shop I had been running. Same problem. I tried installing from anther networked computer CD drive. Same problem. I copied the CD to the hard drive and tried installing from there. Same problem.It's possible my installation problems are related to my specific machine because it is a little unstable. However, never before has a program failed to install. The CD I received was intended for the European market. Don't know if this matters.I eventually did find a work around. It turns out you don't really need to install this program. If you can get it installed on any machine, you can just copy the Paint Shop directory to another machine and it will run there fine."

35539,1,"Like a lot of amateur photographers, I was wondering whether to make the leap and use RAW files or not. I decided to try RAW out, and in order to take advantage of RAW formats I got Aperture.So far, I've found this to be a useful photo-processing program - certainly an improvement over iPhoto. Here are some of the highlights for me:1) Easy to use adjustment tools. If you've used iPhoto or any basic program, you can probably open Aperture and figure out how to use everything in 10 minutes. I remember years ago struggling with Adobe Photoshop and being confused out of my mind.2) Good range of color adjustments available. I love being able to change the saturation of individual colors. The range doesn't quite cover the entire rainbow (orange is missing), but it is great when you want to adjust one color and not the others.3) Aperture allows you to organize similar photos in stacks for easy access. Often, I take a series of photos of the same subject, changing shutter speed or f-stop slightly, to see which composition or exposure I like best. Stacks keeps all of these photos in a group so I can easily compare them later.Now, for the drawbacks:1) The magnification tool (""loupe"") is not as useful as the magnification in iPhoto or other programs. First of all, it slows down the program quite a bit and every time I use it I have to wait about 20 seconds before I can continue using the program. Second, its minimum magnification is 50x, which isn't always useful (particularly if I want to see how a picture would look if cropped). By contrast, iPhoto simply has a useful sliding bar that allows you to zoom in or out quickly.2) Aperture, like many advanced photoshop programs, uses a lot of memory on your hard drive (~1 GB) and ram. Using it slows your computer down. It has already crashed twice on me over the course of 24 hours. This certainly isn't a reason not to get it - I would just warn you against getting it and storing it on your computer if you don't expect to seriously use it.3) No full-screen editing mode."
33253,1,"I've used OS X since the Public Beta and can remember feeling a bit anxious when I first saw how differently things were arranged. I was concerned that the Mac experience was about to be irreparably altered. As it turns out, each revision to this OS has improved on the original theme, and with ""Jaguar"" OS X 10.2 I find myself a confirmed OS X user! I'm in OS X 100% of the time - returning to OS 9 has become an uncomfortable and disorienting experience (I would've never thought it could happen).While it is true that the best experience will come with updated hardware and software, I have found that most recent products are well supported in the ""Classic"" environment. And when updated products are used their application is seamless: true multi-tasking, Plug and Play, exceptional USB and Firewire support, Blue Tooth and 802.11b wireless networking ready. A few of your applications may need to be upgraded, but while you're in the process, you can enjoy the wonderful series of free ""i"" applications that Apple has included: iMovie, iPhoto, iTunes, iChat and iDVD, (included with a ""Super Drive"" enabled Macintosh).Ultimately, I believe the revised user interface and robust UNIX core of Jaguar will win over even the die-hard Classic Mac stragglers, as well as entice many Windows and UNIX aficionados to explore Apple's offerings. And, although you may find the first couple of weeks a bit disorienting, I'm sure that with time OS X will become your preferred operating system - you'll find yourself looking for ways to spend less time in Classic and more time OS X."
41170,1,"Forever Love is the story of a newly married couple in the 70's, played beautifully by Reba McEntire and Tim Matheson. A couple of years after having a baby, Reba's character slips in to a coma and wakes up 20 years later to find out that everything she had once known has changed. Her daughter is about to get married and her best friend has fallen in love with her husband. It's a great story about a love tested with the complications of the situation and is accompanied with beautiful songs by Ms. McEntire, including the title track,&quot;Forever Love&quot;, which I can not say enough about. It is a breathtaking song and really shows off Reba's vocal talents. That song can be found, along with other great songs, on her new CD,&quot;If You See Him&quot;. This movie really showcases Reba's acting ability like never before. She is AWESOME!!!!!!! I really recommend this movie to everyone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

8529,1,"As a 28-year-old life-long Marvel fan, I could not pass up this CD collection, even though I already own the Essential Spider-Man vol. 1 and the Essential X-Men vol. 1 (the contents of both books are covered on this CD).I was glad to see that it was Mac-compatible; however, if you own a Mac, don't run this collection on Safari, as it doesn't handle the Dj-Vu plug-in properly (it works just fine with Explorer). Basically, instead of using an application like Adobe Acrobat Reader, you use your browser (with the Dj-Vu plug-in) to navigate through the pages.Each book is easy to access to, and the fact that it can be read in color or in black and white is a great feature. The image quality is top-notch, and the colors are vibrant (I would say that the visual quality in general is on a par with the great reprint of the Marvel GI Joe comics of 2 years ago).My only real gripe is that Wolverine's popularity is not enough to justify detracking from the promise of the CD-ROM's &quot;first ten issues&quot; and include the &quot;New&quot; X-Men of 1975 (Storm, Wolverine, Colossus and Nightcrawler) instead of the original 1960s Uncanny X-Men. It also would have been great to see the wartime version of Captain America and the Submariner, if only to compare them with their 1960s revival.All in all, it's a great product that definitely gives out a great value for its price. I really hope that future volumes will focus on one series at a time though (which would be a great alternative to Marvel's paperback reprints)."
50075,1,"Having used Macintosh since the Mac Plus of the late 80's, I knew that the latest OS was something I wanted. I've never been unhappy with Apple. So, I bought and installed 10.5 without a hitch. I had the minimum required RAM and an external hard drive for the Time Machine. Now my system was running slower than ever and the external drive was full! I had to double the RAM in my machine and get a larger #2 hard drive to get things working right. Now I'm tickled with the result."
9439,1,"I used this unit to calibrate my Mitsubishi WD65732 DLP HD TV and was surprised at how good the picture looks after the adjustment. I first went through the tv manual to make sure I understood all the various adjustments the tv makes and wrote them down on a spreadsheet so I could study them and make sure I knew how the language related to the SpyderTV adjustment language. Once I did that and marked down the adjustment ranges, it was a breeze to run the software and make the adjustments. It even creates a pdf file at the conclusion for record purposes and future comparisons. Some of the adjustments for color temperature were surprising, but the bottom line is that the picture looks great!"

60013,0,"I think that this version of Outlook would be perfect if I weren't on dial-up: Outlook seems to be incapable of doing anything relating to your HTTP or IMAP email folders without checking the server, to the point that you can't even access them offline. The fact that Outlook has to check the server almost evrey time you do anything to your email can really be grating on dial-up. Maybe there's a way to stop the constant reference to the server, but I haven't found it.It also has an annoying habit of locally replacing one of my two Hotmail accounts with the other, necessitating that I remove and recreate the ""corrupt"" account.Seeing as how I don't use many of Outlook's other bells and whistles, I can't comment on the broader program, but apart from that signficant headache, it works fairly well."

86400,1,"Addendum - My original review of this software started with:""Do not be swayed by those elitist reviewers who pan this program.""Now I realize what some of them were getting at - I still think this is a fantastic piece of software, especially for people who just want to have fun making computer music and are content staying in the Propellerhead playground (and it's a huge playground).The issue is, aside from using the Rewire application to get Reason 3 synths out of the playground, you can't bring outside synths (VST plug ins) into the Reason 3 playground.I very much like the Reason 3 sequencer, but I can't run a 3rd party VST synth with it, and that's what some other people are griping about here. Mea culpa.Here's the rest of my original review;If you're into electronic music and have ever invested any amount of moneyin midi gear, only to find yourself wanting more after spending, say, $3,000,then you should check out the easy to install free demo of Reason 3 availableon the Propellerhead.se (NOT .com) website. You'll go ape#$%*!I can't fathom how these people managed to get this thing to do so muchfor such a modest hardware requirement.I have a P4 with only 256Mb of ram, and I have not experienced a singlecrash yet, no matter how many devices I add to the virtual rack.Any wimpy sounds in Reason can be beefed up using theeffects modules- show me a synth that doesn't have some ""cheesy"" sounds.My only gripe is, I wish the rack components could be enlarged onscreenlike the sequencer window. Unless I'm overlooking a button or commandsomewhere (entirely possible), I hope Propellerheads adds rack resizingin a future version.Again, get their demo! You can play with it for 20 minutes at a time,and you'll know if it's right for you."

What I like about it is that ordering from Amazon (1) saves sales taxes, (2) who wants to go to a CompUsa when you can have it delivered, and (3) Amazon sells the software to you at the net price, i.e. they reduce the price for the rebate so you do not need to cut the bar code, attached the receipts, etc.I am a CPA who does not practice tax accounting and find the Turbo Tax line of products indispensable for my own business and doing tax returns for friends and family members all over the country including multi state tax returns."

I found this to be simply the best in new-user friendliness and in features. The ability to get compact, high quality flash video (flv), multiple tracks, chroma screens... it will have all I need for a long time. Premier 3 lost a star because it seemed relatively slow to render (I could be wrong about that) and the video titles do not seem as sophisticated or varied as in some products. Also, the audio editing is minimal. I also own Photo Elements 5 (IMHO 5 stars), and strongly recommend users look at the new dual package.

50674,1,"I compared VMWare 4.0.5 and Virtual PC 2004 (VPC) side-by-side for a couple of weeks and ultimately decided on VPC for it's affordability, larger memory support, and standard S3 Trio video card emulation which greatly improved the guest OS graphics experience (especially for non-Microsoft OSes). I installed multiple instances of Linux (Redhat and Trustix) and they ran surprisingly well though obviously slower than on a dedicated machine. But, for setting-up a multi-network virtual lab where &quot;how&quot; it works was more important to me than &quot;how fast&quot; it was perfect. Using VPC I was easily able to setup a multi-network virtual lab with several routers, DHCP servers, and DNS servers to iron out some complex interaction scenarios.MS virtual hardware support is not as robust as VMWare however as it seems that you are limited to emulating (4) IDE drives. This wasn't a serious hindrance to me but should be considered.As of 3/5/2004 MS was offering a 45 day evaluation download from the VPC product page. I heartily recommend this product."

It's possibilities are seemingly endless for those of you with creative minds, but for the rest of us, they have pre-fabricated cards, etc. The graphics set is overwhelming, but the search capabilities bring it down to size. There is some standard cheap clipart, but there is a significant amount of high quality clips, artwork and photos. Also, the cartoon-o-matic is fantastic. I can play with it for hours. This program is a lot for your money. It is an excellent purchase if you are not looking for a professional tool. Enjoy!"
41951,1,"This is either an outstanding product, or not an outstanding product, depending upon your usage and technical knowledge and what you expect of it.This software will lead to mixed results for the novice, but if you know your way around DVDs and how the files are stored, many of the problems people encounter using this software have simple fixes.This software works largely good on ""conventional"" movie DVDs (DVD-5 (best!!) or DVD-9 (Ok.) formats) where all you may want to do is watch the movie, but not so great on multiepisode DVDs of TV shows (in DVD-9 format). At least this has been my experience.Other factors include the DVD burning software and it's default settings which is already installed on your system. For example, ensure you can do UDF 1.02 format DVD disks for maximum compatibility. Type of media has an affect on the archive disks created from the software, as the ""cheap"" DVD-R disks sometimes suffers compatiblity problems that are avoided on the name brands. On some multiepisode TV show disks, I've encountered problems with the menuing setup on the second disk, which can prevent viewing of some material."

1417,1,"Very happy with old version 2007. Just what I was looking for because I was used to it. Although I'm not afraid of change with any of the computer versions, it's just easier to work with what I was accustomed. I am very happy with product and with seller. Would buy again."
77411,0,"The seller supplied the product as defined, with as promised delivery.When using the included headset & microphone , I found the one-ear speaker and head clamp was uncomfortable. The sound was poor. I switched to a dual ear speaker/boom microphone I had, and the playback speech was clearer and the headset more comfortable. Their microphone may be better than a simple desk computer microphone, but is nothing to write home about. I think they do sell a better one with their professional packages, at a much higher price.The learning curve is steep, but the program works well when used with Microsoft programs, after you memorize the many ""commands"" and realize you have to issue a command, before you begin your dictation working inside text documents goes smoothly.Their advertising implies that Internet browsing and webpage manipulation is easy. I have not found that to be true. In most instances I get a warning ""This is not a Standard Program and your commands may not function"" By Standard, they mean written by Microsoft as I decode it. Controlling web pages is still a problem for me. There may be some magic commands I haven't found yet that will solve my problems, and I'm hoping.The listing of available commands included in their online manual and the one included in the software package does not include all that are available. Their in-program Help file has a lot more. The problem is thatflipping back and forth between the help screen, and your document screen while hunting for the proper command is annoying. Trying to print the program Command list doesn't work on my computer.Dictation inside of Microsoft Word, works accurately as fast as you can clearly speak using their command set. The playback is with your own voice, which is easy to understand.When playing back transcriptions of previously recorded material, their internal program voice is used. There is a range of voices available, and all are between acceptable and good. I think Version 10 has even better quality voices.The program's ability to train individual words or phrases is very simple and works extremely well. The program worked remarkably well after the brief training exercises, and even better after reading a few of their long exercises. Except for my slurring words in haste, during dictation, recognition was more than satisfactory."

51199,1,"In my opinion, this software is great, especially for a backpacker who just wants to use a GPS as a &quot;toy&quot;. There are 15 major national parks with 4 map views and more than adequate zoom capabilities. In addition, it is possible to create your own routes (by drawing them with your mouse), obtain elevation gains/losses, and automatically create and upload up to 30 waypoints per route to your GPS. There is a search engine to find various points of interest (mines, cemetaries, overlooks, etc) off the beaten path that will give you an exact waypoint to go exploring with a GPS unit. For the average person who likes the seclusion of the backcountry of national parks, who for the most part stays on the trails and assigned backcountry campsites, and who wants to use a GPS, this program is perfect."

82992,1,"I own McAfee Internet Security Suite 2004 but I purchased the stand alone version of this McAfee AntiSpyware 2005 program even though basically the same program is bundled as part of the &quot;Privacy Service Program&quot; with McAfee Internet Security Suite 2004 v6.0 . I did not want to use the Privacy Service program at all so I figured this would work best for me. I also decided could also easily use this as a stand alone program in the future along with another company's antivirus program such as Symantec's Norton Antivirus.This McAfee Antispyware program is very simple to use and it seems to work well. You can open up the program's display properties anytime and monitor its activity and you will see it working as it scans web pages in real time as you browse using Internet Explorer. You can also schedule system wide scans and it has customizable controls so you can enable trusted spyware or adware programs not to be blocked. The biggest drawback is that it does not automatically detect and remove tracking cookies. Its main advantage is realtime scanning and blocking of spyware and adware. Spybot Search &amp; Destroy and Ad-Aware (basic) are both free to download and work very well also however those programs do not auto update and they don't do essential real time scanning to stop the spyware before it infects your computer. Spybot does have an immunize feature that helps block a pre-set number of common spyware/adware programs but this list is static while McAfee's program uses dynamic scanning with the latest automatically updated spyware/adware detections.I would recommend you use all three antispyware programs. Download Spybot and Ad-Aware for free and also install McAfee Antispyware 2005 for real time scanning. In this age of spyware, adware, trojan horses, tracking cookies etc. you can't be too safe. I would also recommend a good firewall like Zone Alarm 4.x or the even more feature rich Zone Alarm Pro 4.x ( Zone Alarm 4 with internet cookie, popup, and privacy controls) . Use a good Antivirus program such as McAfee 2004, Norton 2003, PC-Cillin 2004, or Kaspersky.One more highly rated antispyware program you might want to look at is Webroot's SpySweeper which has all the realtime scanning features of McAfee along with tracking cookie detection. SpySweeper is a seasoned antispyware program known to have one of the highest spyware/adware/tracking-cookie detection rates among all the anti-spyware programs. Although the McAfee Antispyware 2005 is still relatively new to the antispyware game compared to other programs, I would expect this recently released McAfee software to continue to improve this year as this program auto-updates itself with more advanced features and enhanced spyware detections."

17985,0,"I now actually have the newest iteration of this program (""Movie to CD & DVD 2005"") but it is essentially an updated version of this software. I am extremely torn on rating this product. On the positive side, the software makes unbelievably professional looking DVDs that can be played on a computer or conventional DVD player (at least in the US.) The end product is fantastic, and the quality of the image, sound, and menus are first rate.There are two negatives, though, that many others have noticed: the customer support (particularly the website) is absolutely worthless. You need to be a real self-sufficient person to use this software. Secondly, the interfaces are fairly complex and are frequently counterintuitive. A lot of learning occurs by trial and error.Overall, I do recommend the software because it is very capable and reasonably priced. Having said that, you may be content with Windows Movie Maker, which comes bundled with many PCs now, especially if you don't have the patience to learn this rather trying software.Still, though, in the end the DVDs look great!"

If a more in-depth learning experience is what you're after, then spend a little more & buy the more complete version. I'm sorry, but for someone to complain about spending 10 bucks on 2 CD-ROM's - and feel the need to write about it is somewhat confusing to me. I just spent that much on lunch for crying out loud."
44643,1,"Microsoft Word 2007 is a complete reworking of Microsoft Word's earlier versions. The menus are different, the look is different, and the feel is different. Having said that, the basic operation of the program is the same--users of earlier versions of Word really can adapt to Word 2007 in a short time; it is not like learning a whole new program. Since Microsoft World is the standard word processing program for many areas of business, these changes were not entirely welcomed by the user community. Busy professionals (as a practicing attorney, I am one) usually do not appreciate being forced to re-learn significant portions of a basic productivity tool. Familiar drop-down menus that have been mainstays of Microsoft Windows programs are relocated in Word 2007 and the immediate impression of many users, myself included, has been bafflement. I work with my word processor almost every day, for much of the day. For reasons I won't bother to go into, I was forced to learn Microsoft Word 2007 at once, while ""under the gun"" on a major project. This testing by fire proved a number of things.First and foremost, my experience indicates that a determined user can become proficient with the new menus in maybe two hours. I was able to get productive work done within about 20 minutes of using the new program. Initial points of frustration were: a) trying to figure out how to get my ruler back. (Look under ""View"" and check the box for ""ruler."" Easy if you know where to look.) b) finding how to ""save as,"" ""print"" and some other basics. It turns out that the round window symbol in the upper left hand corner brings up a drop-down menu with many of the familiar menus that used to be across the top in Windows 2003. Once I figured out these issues and two or three others, I started to quickly become comfortable with Windows 2007. By the end of the week I came to prefer it to the earlier versions. To be honest, I found it to be kind of fun to re-learn Word. Not everyone will, of course.Many things are easier to do, or improved in Windows 2007. Creating shortcut keys for inserting symbols is a snap; much easier. Windows 2007 has finally fixed problems that existed with Windows' handling of footnotes, which truly is a joy. Bullets, numbers, and spacing are more intelligently handled in my opinion in Windows 2007. The program does not ""fight"" with the user about formatting paragraphs the way Word 2003 did. Further, even if a user is having trouble figuring out how to do a basic function, very often a simple right click will bring up the function (not always).It is human nature not to like change. After using Word 2007 for several weeks, I have come to appreciate that it was time for changes to Word, and Word 2007 was Microsoft's answer to this. If users give the program a chance, I think that most will come to appreciate the improvements. RJB."

The load time between sequences is faster. The game is tad longer than employee of the month, which was a relatively long game. The graphics are of little issue, as they are replications of the cartoons, so they can change very little. As far as installation issues, i had none. People with installation issues should look at their systems first before assuming it is the game. So many situations are caused not by the game, but by the system it is on. Troubleshoot. In any case, this program never crashed for me. It ran beautifully and was great fun for myself and my 5 year old son to play. I would recommend this to any Spongebob fan."

What I like best about the product is that it imports information from the prior's year return, making it easy to get moving on a new return. Also, I like the fact that it suggests the most common answer for questions that are irrelevant to the average person.The only real problem I've had is when I need to file two state returns. The numbers aren't transferred between the returns. Also, I work in NY and live in NJ and I think it's almost impossible to find the section to calculate credits for days worked outside of NY. (This can save hundreds of dollars.) I had to print out the previous year's return to find the question number."

I have all the Uncanny X men comics or books from Giant Sized X men to current issue of Uncanny X men 470 and I must say this is a good supplement if you don't want to pay a lot of money for the older 1970 issues. I used this DVD rom as quick reference if I want to go back to read an issue.This set does include Annuals too and the table of contents is laid out in years so it's easy to navigate through and see the covers. I also agree that sometimes you have to adjust your Adobe PDF to fit the pages so you can read clearly which can be a little annoying.I sit in front of computers all day and when it's slow at work, I launch this baby and read away. It's nothing like sifting through years of X men..it's just clicks away. However, I rather have real comic in my hand if I'm resting at home on the couch then having a hot labtop on my chest. So the money you spend is worth it, I mean I see the Uncanny X men 266 sometimes sell half the selling price of this DVD ROM. ;)"

After 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5, Shredder crashes. There's a way around it: Play the variation in a different move order. But I shouldn't have to do this. Anyway, I'm happy with the product.

Even though I am still 11 years old I like to program games.I think that its cool that you can pick players from real football to put on your team. All the backyard characters have there own personality and its really cool to talk to them. Another good thing about the series is that the games are really cheap. I think it is worth the money and you will play it for a long time with out getting bord. But if you do buy it I would suggest putting it on the hardest level so it will take longer to beat the game.

The recorder is great for the first couple classes! It got me thru some serious lectures that I was able to download to my Mp3 and listen to while I worked out! Saves me more time than any other software program out there!

We are relatively computer astute, and maybe could have gone in and fiddled with things to make it work - but I don't want to. Its going back.Another down-side for me is that it consists of single CD's for each level of math, all of which need to be installed separately.

26274,1,"As embarrassing as it is to admit this, my husband and I are stumped. I went through this game once with my 3-year-old son and made it to the end. The next time my husband played it with him and told me later that he got stuck. I laughed to myself, thinking how smart my husband is, yet can't even play a kid's game. Well, I played it today with my son and, let me tell you, I had to quit without coming near to resolving this. How can an otherwise 36-year-old woman of average intelligence, and a 43-year-old man of slightly above average intelligence not figure this out? It's aimed at kids THREE to eight! We've clicked on everything possible, but we aren't getting anywhere! It is a fun game, but I can't see a three-year-old figuring it all out (which is why it gets 4 stars as opposed to 5), or a 36-year-old mother of a 3-year-old. I'm going to play it again and see if I can't do it this time. Obviously we are the only adults with this problem, as no one else wrote anything of the sort in their reviews.If someone could send me a cheat-sheet of sorts, we'd be highly grateful (albeit humiliated as well).I'll be up tonight, all night, trying to crack the case of the stolen conch shell.

I upgraded my machine from Windows 2000 professional and as stable, and fast Windows 2000 was, XP takes all of that to the next level mixing the best features of Windows 2000 (stability) and Windows 98/ME (User interface, plug/play, etc).In my opinion, this is a must for home users. Windows 98/ME were average operating systems that never offered anything in terms of stability, scalability, robust networking, etc. One of my favorite features so far is the built-in support for CD burners. In the past, my success at making CD's under Windows 2000 was 60-40. I've made more coasters than I have cups to put them under. A few minor pluses of XP are IE 6.0 and Media Player 8.0 which are available as separate download. Another really cool feature is the support for multiple users logging in concurrently.Windows 2000 users may not jump at XP Professional as they have most of the same features already in their current OS, but Windows 95/98/ME users will find a wonderful operating systems that is so much more stable that their older operating system. Microsoft got it right with Windows 2000 and this is just icing on the cake. Buy it now and upgrade."
90590,1,My purchase was based on an upgrade to Office 2007 at work and wanted to be consistent at home. Excel functionality is better than 2003 and other areas are very similar. The look is a little different and took me a short period of time to figure out. If you're open to a little change then you'll be fine. The one issue I had was with Outlook's installation and Microsoft tech support was great in solving the problem.
11436,1,"As an amateur photographer, I was looking for something powerful at low cost. Lightroom definitely fit the requirement. However, I have little experience working with any other professional photography software so I do not have much else to compare it with.The interface it totally different than any other Adobe product. But what is wrong with that? The Library module is breathtakingly fast and I don't fear looking at hundreds of pictures at one time anymore. The Develop module is extremely precise but sometimes hard to navigate. I haven't used the Slideshow module much but what I have seen of it, I must say it does more than show pictures, it presents them. As for the Print and Web modules, I have yet to explore them. Yes, everything is fast, but you still have to have patience from time to time. Keywording is so easy both to assign and categorize; child, parent, grandparent (etc.) is a great idea.Lightroom defeats Photoshop when it comes to picture processing because I am not trying to create or design anything. It is great for processing, organizing, adjusting, and touching up photos, but you are handicap if you don't have any true editing software. I was quite disappointed with the dubbed down Clone/Heal tool. In CS2 you can use the clone tool for anything; here it is very much restricted and only good for taking out (most) dust bunnies. I was hoping Lightroom was a little more powerful when it came to editing. Cropping and straightening is very interesting. You might say it is backwards. I am used to working in Bridge, so this difference is something I will have to get used to. Truthfully, I don't like it even though it technically makes more sense.Another reason I did not make it a 5 star was because it is not that easy to remember what can be done in what module, view, window, etc. It is almost on the verge of being too cluttered. Also I can't understand why they say you can change the interface background color; white, gray, and black are the only options. I would be pleased if they had real colors. But that is only trivial.Overall, Lightroom is excellent software and definitely well-priced. Despite a few interface clashes, I can't say anything against it."

72976,1,"I bought this hoping I would be able to use it to manipulate a program I was writing and was pleasantly suprised that I was able to just copy one of the XML files and modify it so that it would send keystrokes to my application. No COM or DDE or anything else, just had my application capture keystrokes and react based on that. It has been very reliable so far. I couldn't find any documentation on the XML files, but it wasn't that hard to figure out because they include quite a number of them to support applications like Windows Media Player, etc."
50761,2,"I like that this software is very intuitive. You do not need to read long, complicated manuals to start using it - it is all pretty much self-explanatory - and with the backup wizard, which takes you step-by-step, it is even easier.Which is good because I do not rate their manual very highly. It gives little background information. For example, it does not tell you what exactly the difference is between a backup file created with the &quot;Backup New and Changed Files only / Append&quot; option, and the &quot;Backup New and Changed Files only / Overwrite&quot; option. While it looks pretty straightforward at first glance, it really isn't when you have to decide which route to take.As to their customer support: No, they definitely don't shine. I wrote them an e-mail many weeks ago because the manual that came with the program had whole sections double while others were missing - I never received a response from them. To be fair though: When I finally called them I received a replacement in the mail very quickly.By the way, I am experiencing regularly reboots during backup jobs - no error messages, which gets old very quickly. The one solution offered in their discussion forum didn't work, and so far no response from their support.I take it from other reviews here that &quot;when it works it works great&quot;. But it seems to be relatively unreliable for me, so combined with their poor support and the really very little support information posted on their website, I am only giving it 2 stars."

82152,2,"Normally, the Arthur series of educational CDs for children are enjoyable, educational and engaging. It was for this reason that I purchased this CD for my 6 year old child. However, when we recived it, the &quot;Thinking Games&quot; turns out to have only 5 or 6 activities, and no automatic leveling (where the CD challenges the child when the child correctly completes an activity. Further, the games that are used seem more like arcade activities, with very little actual &quot;thinking&quot; necessary on the part of the child. While my child enjoys it, I would much rather have them playing with Arthur's First or Second Grade CDs which are challenging, interesting and multifacited.

26721,0,"While I have been a big fan of Streets and Trips since the 2002 version, this latest release is a disappointment. This is due to accuracy problems and the competitive landscape. Since S&T; 2005 was released, the big news in map software is Google's launch of Google Earth, which includes over twelve (12) terabytes of satellite data. Microsoft has responded with a less robust product, MSN Virtual Earth, which has some connectivity with Streets and Trips 2006.The latest release of S&T; 2006 has the same fast, robust interface as previous versions and some new features such as a night mode (which itself is of dubious value). However, my limited testing has uncovered glaring errors in the map data. Specifically, the NYC subway system depiction has several erroneous or omitted subway stops in Manhattan alone. While this may seem trivial, the NYC subway is the busiest in the United States. Moreover, some of the errors are grossly inaccurate, such as showing a B/Q Subway stop at Lexington and 63rd. Neither line passes within a half mile (quite a long distance in Manhattan) of this location. Other less egregious errors include an omission of a 28th street stop on the 1/9 train.There has always been a poor representation of the public transportation system in Streets and Trips, severely limiting its utility for urban users of the software. The Chicago Transportation authority (CTA), for example, has online point-to-point directions that include walking, buses and subway. S&T; has no such feature, nor does it even have walking directions that overlook one-way streets. At least there should be plug-ins for different metropolitan areas, if not including built-in overlays of train and subway infrastructure that appear with a simple toggle. Even worse, many of the subway stops that are correctly positioned in Streets and Trips do not show at magnification levels that clearly depict stops that are farther from the viewing center of the map. Such visual anomalies can cause much confusion for users. This problem appears to be worse than in previous versions.My major complaint with earlier editions of Streets and Trips was that it didn't integrate with other location-specific data sources, such as Citysearch, Craigslist or metropolitan traffic web sites. Microsoft's integration with MSN Virtual Earth is a nice start. However, the map quality and features are below that of Google's offering. Moreover, it uses a less robust web interface, which [the lack of] is the main reason users like Street and Trips in the first place.Streets and Trips 2006 is still the fastest map software with the smoothest interface. However, Microsoft needs better quality control and bug reporting. Longer-term, Microsoft needs to create an ecosystem around Streets and Trips with various entertainment, travel and transportation data sources included in a real-time format. Otherwise, Google is going to drive it off the market.Pros*Speed*Some interactivity with MSN Virtual Earth*No advertisementsCons*Lack of integration with third-party data*No available data for other continents*No map or point-of-interest updates*Quality control and difficult bug reporting*No plug-ins*No bookmarks*Lacking non-driving (cycling, walking) maps and public transit grids"
71227,1,"I loaded StarOffice5.2 on a Windodws 98 PC and love it. It takes a few clicks to get the hang of it, but it does anything you want, and it does it all from the same interface. I am writting this after simply typing in the web address to Amazon.com in the address bar, which opened the built-in browser window, boom! so it is like having all of the programs you use in one.It has an Explorer sidebar, plus plenty of function specific button bars for wordprocessing, html editing, or spreadsheets, etc.This is NOT a hard program to use. I thought it would be a hassle but wanted to try it, and I am glad I did. Matches Word in functions and features, and you don't get that ""M$ overcharged me again because they can"" feeling. It comes with a good manual and the price is GREAT. Enjoy."
65162,1,"This CD is very challenging. When I first got it several months ago it was kicking my butt! It made me realize that I didn't know as much about the endgame as I hoped I did...and I was near 1900 and had been over that mark a couple of years ago.The interface is much like other Convekta software, but if you're not familiar with that, I'll give a brief overview.There is a ""Practice"" mode and a ""Test"" mode (for veteran users: there is no ""Study"" mode in this program). In Practice mode there is a HUGE, scrolling left sidebar where you can select any topic (ex: Rook and Pawn Endings) and within that a variety of subtopics (ex: Rook against Pawn) and within that there are more divisions (ex: Pawn other than Rook's Pawn). You can select individual problems to do, skip around however you like, etc. It will give you hints if you make mistakes and show refutations of wrong moves.The mode I most often use is ""Test,"" where you can choose any number of problems you wish to solve, from any rating bounds [1900-2750], and ""New,"" ""All,"" or ""Erroneous"" exercises. You can choose only the larger themes to be tested on (Pawn Endings, Rook Endings, etc.) but not the breakdown into small categories like in Practice mode, or you can choose to be tested on All Themes (the entire CD) if you wish. After the test you get a Rating performance and the percentage of points you received for solving the problems.Working on my ""basic"" endgames with materials such as THEORY AND PRACTICE OF CHESS ENDINGS (also by Convekta), and CHESS SCHOOL 4: MANUAL OF CHESS ENDINGS (by Sarhan Guliev), really filled in the gaps in my understanding. Then I started to work with this program again and I did a lot better, performing in the 2400 range. You will start to get a feel of how to approach simple-looking positions (that really aren't so simple at all!).This program won't teach you how to play endgames, so don't buy it expecting that (buy THEORY AND PRACTICE for this), but it will help your endgame play and help you calculate in the endgame better. This is a very challenging program, and I think 1700 is the minimum rating needed to benefit from it."
84634,1,"Hi all, I've been writing code for over 5 years now and work as a developer for a software company. I'm also MCAD Certified. We use VS.Net 2005 exclusively and the reviews that you will read below about this program sucking are not true. I believe the reason users may think this program sucks is because they don't know how to use it. It's just like anything else, if you don't know how to use the program you won't benefit from its features. Now one thing I will tell you is that when you want to create a Windows Service you WILL need the Professional version of VS.Net 2005 to do that. Other than that I have created atleast 25 web sites ranging from personal sites to enterprise e-commerce, numerous desktop apps that range from single managed apps to apps that use WIN32 API, ie old COM stuff, Class libraries, Server Controls and .Net Remoting objects. So unless you need to create Windows Services this is the package for you."

I have an AMD Duron 1 Ghz (overclocked) with 40 Gb hard drive and 512 RAM, and it works almost as fast as Windows 2000 Pro. Also, it provides support for plenty of devices (ie. video card, sound, etc.). It's definitely worth the upgrade for me."

Oh another thing, this product is dangerous when you select all file formats, it even took over my Corel Draw files, even webpage documents, I said to myself what is going on here. When I tried to open those Corel Draw files in Paint shop it gave me an error saying it was not recognised, come on whats happening here?You know what I suggest? Buy a product thats actually dedicated and good at what it does, &quot;handling images&quot;, I did not ask for it to handle CAD, Vector etc... A matter of fact whats the sense in spending the money when you already have a product that does the same thing with ease of use and simplicity. Microsoft Office already comes with the excellent Photo Editor and who doesn't have Office? Save the money and buy a product that does what its meant to do. If you want a product that really works, buy Photoshop Elements or Picture It! Digital Image Pro or stick with Photo Editor, plus it has a lot of editing tools."

66522,2,"The traditional red packet of ""McAfee Internet Security Suite"" has been replaced by a shiny and nicely designed black one. This seems to be the most remarkable alterance that buyers will get after forking-out their hard-earned dough! Only very little has changed: in terms of the actual software. And, I am far from being amused.For anyone who currently runs the 2005 (or even the 2004) edition of any Internet Security suite, (be it McAfee or Norton), better save your wad. You need not pay for this one. The notorious problems of both McAfee's Antivirus and Internet Security hogging down your computer's performance resources has not been fixed. And, the same is true for a lot of other incompatibility problems that were evident in the 2005 edition.Meanwhile (on the positive side), an improved 'digital document-shredder', which is marginally better than what featured in the 2005 edition of this software has been added. Still, buyers need not applaud it, because it essentially does the same job that the 'Recycle Bin', which comes integrated with Microsoft Windows, does. Also included in this software is one annoying pop-up, which constantly shows-up to remind you to register the software. And to make matters worse, McAfee deliberately designed it in such a way that you cannot turn it off. So, it means that if you must stop it from disturbing you, you must either register the software or you uninstall it completely.In conclusion, I must say that I was really disappointed by this 2006 edition of ""McAfee Internet Security Suite"". Although, I must add that in terms of good protection, it gets a pass mark. But the fact that it significantly drains computers' performance-enhancing resources in order to provide this security-cover, makes it a painful pyrrhic victory for users."

17398,1,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided to give this product a try. My Norton subscription ran out and I had concerns about the new version. Too many times, vendors write software that is a genuine mess, giving Microsoft a bad name. After all, if the creator of Windows XP made it, shouldn't it be a seamless program? My answer is yes and no. The program does exactly what it is supposed to do. It did take a fair amount of time to set it up (dial up), but other than that, went well. Like all aspects of Windows XP, OneCare tries to help you. The problem for me is, the computer is busy doing its own thing, and my needs are secondary. I utilize a laptop and do not leave it turned on all the time, so when I boot up, OneCare dutifully performs its tasks, and this takes time. You can neuter it, but it kind of defeats the ideas surrounding it. If you have a dedicated home system with a high speed connection, this product may be ideal for you. For those of us on the go, I suggest purchasing Office for Mac and installing it on your Ibook, leaving your Windows based system at home. I've used Microsoft products for a very long time, but feel that their very best products have been Windows '98, and the aformentioned product for Macintosh."

Then I went to the company website (Broderband) and go to the XP compatible page only to see that the latest version listed there is 8.0 when there is a 9.0 ver released! The 9.0 ver page states that it is Win XP compatible! I strongly suggest that if Broderband wishes to sell older product, they need to be very clear that this is their intention(third-party vendors included). Many wasted $$$.

15754,0,"I've been using Final Draft since version 6, and I will say I am happy with the changes they made to 7.The controls are very intuitive. I actually spend more of my time going from rough draft to first draft paring down the dialogue because it really is so simple to enter. The auto-complete function coupled with the ability to quickly enter two person dialogue (simply hitting tab will set up a new character's dialogue line,) really does save an incredible amount of time.The notecard function helps me a great deal during the beginning stages of writing a script. Script ideas can quickly and easily be jotted down and saved. It saves me a lot of desk space which was before saved for countless Post-Its.The script reading function is a neat little added function. It isn't a substitute for having live actors read through it, but being able to hear the words out loud does come in handy.Earlier versions of FD7 were a bit buggy, but the latest version build does seem to run a lot smoother.There's an option for stageplays but, to be honest, I'd stick with a regular word processor. It takes WAY too much time to correct the default formating to make it worth your while.I am still quite frustrated with the activation/deactivation convention Final Draft has decided to use.When you purchase a software license, you are allowed to activate Final Draft on 2 computers. I only used one and was going on my merry way when the hard drive crashed. I, mistakenly it turns out, went ahead and just used the second activation.The hard drive is older, so it does give me problems sometimes. When the PC crashed again, I had to call customer support and have them release the customer number so I could reactivate my license.I needed to do it again just recently, and was lectured on the phone by person at tech support about how he could only give me one more ""freebie,"" and that next time he would have to charge me $99. I'm sorry, but buying version 6 and then upgrading to version 7 cost me over $300. Being able to login to an account and freeing up activations needs to be implemented.All in all, this is a very good program for what it's built to do: write screenplays. Playwrights would be better advised to stick with their run of the mill word processor."

If you want to access SQL Server from this Standard edition, you will have to install a local MSDE copy, and only then, SQL Server's client tools.

21852,1,"Here are my thoughts:- I don't intend to submit architect quality plans to my local office. I'll get a professional for that. However, HAD 4.0 gives me an excellent perspective for what is and isn't possible. Moreover, with all the planning constraints imposed on the construction area, distance from boundary, etc I think HAD 4.0 is essential.- I'm English and my architect is French. We need a common tongue. I have already sent him one set of ""plans"" and his attitude ""for once I know exactly what is required of me"", I certainly haven't compromised his ""artistic integrity"" and I had the distinct impression he was interested in acquiring a copy of HAD 4.0 for himself.- For the most part I found HAD 4.0 to be a stable programme in both W2000 and WXP. There seems to be a glitch when ""File-Save"" is activated for the first time and the programme hangs. The best way to overcome this is to close down the File window and wait for the prompt for you to save the file. Incedentally, HAD 4.0 has an excellent autosave option perhaps anticipating this problem where all ""corrupted"" files are re-presented.What would I change. The price is excellent and I would certainly pay 2-3x the current price. The roofing option is limited but for 90% of designs is not a deathknell. I didn't buy HAD 5.0 because of the negative reviews but HAD 4.0 covers all my needs."

The bike riding was inventive, rather than a train or car or what have you, and I loved being down by the lighthouse, near the water.I believe it is one of HER Interactive's best games so far and is the best bet for a Nancy Drew gamer."

When you go to VMWARE newsgroups you will see many troubles with getting networking to work correctly. I have had success but this product works for so many operating systems, it's hard to get understandable information (in my case the RedHat OS) to work with the product.Another problem is that Redhat and many other Linux distros have evolved to a new version of it's GUI environment (XFree86 4.0). The problem is that out-of-the-box, VMWARE doesn't support this and you will have problems with VMWARE if you upgrade your environment to this version.The last problem is related to Redhat 9.0. I'm not sure if the problem is directly related to VMWARE or Redhat. I have done a few clean installs on hardware dedicated to Redhat -- Pentium 4 Machines. When I try to install Redhat 9.0 with VMWARE, after about 30 minutes of installation, I get a corrupted file (I believe xpdf) and I can't easily skip this program and keep installing (skipping is not possible with RedHat 9). I eventually have to cancel the install and eventually install Redhat 8.0. For the most part, Redhat 9 is where most of the problem resides but I only have this problem when installing with VMWARE so VMWARE gets some of the blame.I'm sure there are ways around all the problems above. For me, I purchase software like I purchase a car. When I put the key in the ignition and start the car, the car should work exactly as expected. I have no desire to tinker with what I just purchased to get the thing to work. With VMWARE, don't be surprised to get stuck tinkering for hours to get everything to work exactly as it's supposed to. Because of this, this product is getting 3 stars.I won't be surprised if other users rate VMWARE with 5 stars. I'm sure future versions of this software will solve the problems that I have experienced above."

It is good .......but keep your eyes open for better French software."
59341,1,"My twin daughters were given this gift (math adventure ages 6-9) for x-mas when they were barely six years old. At the time, this game was WAY too advanced for them, and it actually irritated me because I had to help them out so much with it. Zip forward a few years and they are now eight years old and in the second grade. I put this game on a few days ago and was amazed at how useful it is now. It uses shapes, fractions, money, time, addition and subtraction. I strongly recommend this program, it closely matches concepts taught in the second grade and is very good practice (and a good way to get them out of your hair for a few minutes) :)"
38130,0,"OK. I am a horsewoman. I take riding lessons and am trying to read every horse book available to man. I bought this game because I do not own a horse myself, and I wanted a reasonable game that I could do showjumping on.This game is not great. For one thing, it's languistically incorrect. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A 15.9 HAND HIGH HORSE! This was obviously made by someone who doesn't know horses. There really is no difference in personalities between these horses. You don't even have to get strides right to clear a jump. You don't give your horse any water.The stable jobs are VERY repetitive. GEEZE. I hope there are better ones on the market. I think I'll look for a racing game next, though.The computer always gives little &quot;hiccups&quot; at crucial times. The game has frozen my computer numerous times.But, on the bright side, the courses are (somewhat, interesting. The showjumping courses are nice, somewhat that is. BUT YOU ONLY GET THE SAME PRACTICE COURSE TO RIDE EVERY TIME. GEEZE. BORING. You go into every competetion but the first completely blind... Never knowing what to expect. But, it's okay. Not great. I'm sure there are much better games though."

This may be so, but it is more indicative of the poor state of the home design software market.The good:- Nice, intuitive interface- Relatively easy to get started- 3D view is impressive, at first (see the bad)The bad:- 3D view is slow & hard to navigate. Helicopter view is somewhat better, but still not very user-friendly. Ability to navigate with cursor keys instead of mouse would help- Buggy. I crashed several times, and lost significant work (save early, save often)- Some features are very limited. You cannot rotate a shower 90 degrees. You cannot resize sinks and other bathroom equipment- Overkill. Some features like plumbing and electricity might be attractive to some, but I would rather have had more focus on the basics- CPU intensive.

64414,1,"Upgraded from the non-Pro version. Pro expands on a huge amount of functionality and makes many of the tasks that you could do with the earlier version much simpler. Roof's (my nemesis in the $100 version) are manageable. Dormers are easy. Centering a door on a window on the opposite wall is automated. Defining half-height wainscotting is now do-able. Haven't tried the CAD functions and I'm hoping I won't have to, because it looks like Pro doesn't have much beyond simple shapes, plus being able to read CAD designs from the $1300 version.The video tutorials are a bit slow, but very useful. 2 hrs of them. There are also sites to go for help and to download custom item CAD files. Will post more when I have completed this house design.My real need for this project is to show my architect that it is actually possible to turn-around design changes in hours rather than weeks. My permit office requires architect sign-off on pretty much everything. Worth many times more than $500 to my project."

61201,0,"The main reason I got the Dazzle DVD recorder was to copy my VHS tapes to DVD. Mostly I have instructional videos and a few old videos from a trip. So far, I guess the Dazzle is doing what it says it does, but not without causing a lot of frustration first. I had problems installing both the Instant DVD Recorder software, and Pinnacle Studio. Instant DVD froze twice, and I had to restart the computer both times. Pinnacle Studio also froze twice. The 2nd time I was trying to install it froze when it appeared to be almost finished, it said it was configuring the software. After about 10 minutes I had to ctrl alt delete and close it. But it must have finished installing cause it was on my computer and working.The first thing I tried to do with it was try using Studio to edit some mini DV home movies that I want to put on DVD. My camcorder instructions say it can be connected to the computer with a USB cable, but Pinnacle Studio couldn't detect the camcorder and says it must be connected with a firewire cable. I don't have one of those, so I went looking for the S-video cable to hook it up through the Dazzle. Tore the house apart looking for it, but couldn't find it, so I can't comment on how well it works with that. I decided to try VHS to DVD using Studio. The video it recorded was choppy and the sound was garbled. I thought maybe the VHS tape was bad, so I tried a different one. Same as the first.I couldn't figure out what the problem was with Pinnacle Studio, so I tried the Instant DVD software to do the transfer. I recorded 5 minutes of a VHS tape (I didn't want to waste my time if it was going to be garbled too), it recorded fine.So it seems after finally getting the software installed it does the bare minimum I wanted out of it, record VHS to DVD, but it seems I won't be doing any editing with the software."
87755,0,"I was headed to Las Vegas to go to the Global Gaming Expo when I found ""Monopoly Casino: Vegas Edition"" was released. So, instead of buying it, I decided I'd go to G2E and see the newest Monopoly slot machines, and then, when I returned and bought the software, I could compare the play to the original. (...)The slot machines in this program are a grave disappointment over the original version (Monopoly Casino), for the first has sixteen normal slot machines and then three official WME Monopoly slot machines, including ""Once Around,"" ""Chairman of the Board,"" and ""Reel Estate."" The new program does not have any WME slot machines, only nine typical slot machines and three video slots, none of which are professional enough to be authentically used in Vegas.The ""Vegas Edition"" did fix the poker room to reflect the current trend in double blinds instead of ante. It also added a BINGO game, to which my wife is addicted.Overall, the game is playable and nice, but it might have been more appropriate to name this ""Indian Casino"" instead of ""Vegas Edition.""(...)"

If you complete both level one and two you'll be equipped to go to france.Now some of you that have read previous reveiws heard that you need a headset to do a part of the course, and that absolutly true. with the headset come a little microphone. A native speaker will say a word then you will say it back. You immediatly get feedback on how you did. It tells you how close you came to sound like the native speaker. So if you keep practicing that you will get closer and closer to speak the accent. And this is a must. You must be able to speak the french accent for it to be totally complete ,and thats what the headset is for . it will make you master the accent. so you may be saying where do i get the headsets? They are $20 and can be bought at www.rosettastone.com once you are there you have to add something to your cart. it will take you to a different page and at the bottom of the page is the headset-add it to your cart-and that's how you get the headset.it has been a pleasure reviewing this item- Bon Jour!Jour!"
22663,1,"If you love horses (and the Saddle Club), you will love this game. It is a mixture of adventure and mystery and i recommend it highly. The overall plot of the game is good but the graphics need some improvment. The character's faces looked somewhat deformed at times and there are a few glitches. It took quite a while for me to get the hang of this game but once i had, it was quite fun. I had alot of trouble when it came to the shipwreck mystery but i finally got the hang of it. I also had a few difficulties when i had to go into the mine. I had to get cheats of a cheat site because i just couldn't find the right path! Apart from that it was fun. You get to chose your main character (Stevie, Lisa or Carole) and what colour horse they ride. You can also groom, feed and muck out. There are also a few other activities you can do throughout the game like Pony Club, photo taking and butterfly catching. I think girls from the age of 10+ would enjoy this game."

I was very impressed with the system this software uses to teach you the language it has everything from voice recongition (to correct your pronunciation) to games to literature in Hebrew. The variety of different ways to learn the language in this program, to me, is one of its greatest assets because there is so much of the language for you to learn(over 10,000 words and thousands of phrases) that a variety of ways to learn it is necessary. The program also has many conversation practices which I found to be very realistic, imformative, and even fun. This program really earns the 5 star rating and my review just touches the surface of what Hebrew Now really has to offer."

1907,1,"I want to make it clear that Namo WebEditor is not for people who are &quot;wet behind the ears&quot; and barely understand the concept of Copy and Paste. Namo WebEditor is easy to use for those who feel like they have at least grown past the dazed and confused, clueless newbie stage.It is possible to find dummied-down web editors out there that are even easier to use than Namo WebEditor, but you'll usually have to give up a lot and put up with a lot. You'll probably get bloated, slow-loading code that may not be cross-browser compatible, and if the program allows you to access to the HTML, it will probably be limited and the program might mangle any code you insert. It's usually a pain to add or delete text and images with those programs since the pages will not adjust automatically like they will when using Tables with Namo WebEditor. After a while, you'll start to feel the invisible shackles of those babyfied web editors and you'll ache for something better. Namo WebEditor is that something better. It gives us the freedom and power we desire without sacrificing user-friendliness. It doesn't assume you are a rocket scientist, but it doesn't treat you like you're in diapers either.If you require a boat load of generic templates to choose from so your web site looks exactly like 10,000 other web sites out there, Namo WebEditor may not be for you since it doesn't come with that many templates at this time. But, if you hate the cookie-cutter look and want to create your own pages, Namo's WYSIWYG drag and drop editor makes it easy. I created my own pages with Namo WebEditor from scratch and it was fun, not frustrating. I designed a page that I was satisfied with (I call it my sourdough page) and used that page to make all of the others. You only have to create one page from scratch and then use that page as a template. Some newbies try to create every page from scratch which is silly and I can see why they would be frustrated.I don't have room here to mention all of the things I have written on my Web Design Deodorizer page about why I love Namo Web Editor, but I'll try to hit the highlights. One really cool feature that could be overlooked is the Document Information dialog box. It shows the total file size of the page (including the file sizes of images), it gives you a word count, and it tells you approximately how fast the page will load using different connection speeds. Even a chronically negative person would have to admit that is a very useful feature.If you've used other web editors, the copy and paste abilities of Namo's WYSIWYG editor might shock you. Many other web editors only copy plain text (stripped of all attributes), but Namo WebEditor allows you to copy the style, font, color, links, paragraph style, background color, table properties, cell properties, and so on. After you copy and paste using Namo WebEditor a few times, your old web editor may seem awkward and outdated.Namo WebEditor also has a built-in spell checker, multiple undo/redo, case changer (upper case, lower case, sentence case, and more), HTML verification, and it will also clean up the HTML for you if you want. Namo WebEditor not only has find and replace, but it also has global find and replace which is great for doing things such as updating the copyright date on every page. If you have a lot of pages, you can change in seconds what it would normally take days to change by hand.On top of everything else, Namo WebEditor has an instant access, color coded HTML editor. Of course, you never have to use it, but for people who know at least a little HTML or those who just need to add special code to a page (such as code for an advertisement), it's such a nice thing to have.I've only had a few questions since owning Namo WebEditor and I got fast answers at their forum every time. The whole Namo experience has been enjoyable so far and I don't think things are going to change any time soon since I've had Namo WebEditor for over a year now. It's a great product for creating and maintaining a web site and unlike some other web editors, it doesn't require a monster computer to run. Namo WebEditor worked as smoothly on my old 233MHz computer as it did on the 2.60GHz computer that followed. That's impressive on it's own, but add in all of the other things along with the affordable price and you're looking at a must-have web design product that almost anyone with a PC can enjoy."

You often have to ""think outside of the box"". He'd play it all day if we'd let him. Once you do all 3 games (which could take hours), the games do repeat and therefore makes it easier to find the clues, however, it still provides a challenge and he still is entertained by it.

I usually don't access the clip art or photos that come with it. I just drag in my photos, backgrounds and clip art that I want and then mess around with them.As a publisher who has used Pagemaker and Indesign, this program has been the ""little engine that could"", helping me to easily create graphics as needed which I can then copy and paste into the other programs. You can ""export"" to a variety of graphic formats also.You can ""stretch"" the background to fit the size you have chosen, you can ""layer"" things and ""group"" things however you want and send them forward or back with the click of a button. You can apply ""effects"" that include edges, masks, glows, shadows with a click of a button also. There's a great ""Headline"" text feature that gives you pre-mades and lets you customize them anyway you want. The regular text feature lets you change the leading in your lines & apply glows to make the text stand out from photos.This program makes Scrapbooking so very easy, nothing esoteric to learn, just start dragging things in and clicking buttons. I make title pages for slide shows/movies with this program, DVD covers, just finished my Christmas letters & envelopes. It has all the usual templates to use, calendars, business cards, labels, etc.If you want a gazillion pieces of clip art this probably isn't for you, but if you want to create and publish and play with graphics/photos, this is a great, easy to use program.I just ordered it to give to my sister for Christmas, I think she will have just as much fun with it as I have!"

26021,1,"I haven't explored all of the features yet, and may never use many of them. I bought it specifically for cycling use, planning routes, estimating distances and climbs, that sort of thing.I've found the program pretty intuitive, I've only gotten into the help files a couple of times, and have found what I was looking for. So far, so good. I have not had any serious problems setting up routes, and the distances and climbing totals have so far been almost dead on when matched against my cyclocomputer.Occasionally when a lot of turns in a short distance are plotted, the software will re-route, requiring you to go back and add waypoints in at mid-points. I've also found places where I've had to add in roads. In one case it was a significant 4 lane route that's been open for about 10 years, and in another case it was a leg of a major state road that splits into 2 one-way sections going through town, been that way for at least the 30 years I can remember. The changes were fairly easy to make, but paper maps of the areas show them correctly.Overall I love the program."

35076,0,"Overall, I expect this could be a good product (Poser) but it suffers greatly from a very, very bad user interface (if you're familiar with Cararra, you know what it's like). Unlike most 3D programs, it relies on a single view rather than a 3-axis workspace. This means you spend most of your time shuffling through ""rooms"" rather than working with your objects. It also makes placing objects harder than it needs to be. The workspace is frankly overdesigned and wastes TONS of screen space for no apparent reason other than to show off their icons, which aren't much to look at to begin with. However, the end product, if you have the patience, is much improved over previous versions (I have Poser 3 from a few years back).On the other hand, Shade LE is quite good. Comparitively easy to learn and it lets you create pretty decent 3D art for the price. Some of the interface is a bit clunky, but overall I'd give it four stars rather than 3."

Bad experiences with Symantec and McAfee products have turned me away from anything they make and the reviews on the newest release of Trend Micro's PC-cillin indicate that they too have ""improved"" their latest version to the point where it no longer works well with many computers.I have read good things about ZoneAlarm in the past and was just about to purchase a 3-User set. Then I read Psybearian's review. Apparently, here is another company that has ruined perfectly good software.It was nice of Psybearian to give us a heads-up about the latest version of ZoneAlarm. Unfortunately, his advice for an alternate may not be the best. He recommended Comodo Firewall. I did a little research on my own and found that many people are having great difficulties with that software. It does not play friendly and is very difficult (almost impossible) to uninstall. Getting rid of it has become such a problem that a program was created to do just that. A thread in the Comodo Support forums mentions a standalone tool that can remove the firewall completely.WHAT! It needs a separate program to uninstall? Yikes! This does not sound like something I would want on my computer.I haven't discovered anything bad about AVG in my research. I guess that's where I'll go for anti-virus protection.If the people at ZoneAlarm fix their problem, I hope somebody will post an update to this thread. They were one of the best last year."

16797,1,"I purchased a copy of the Alaska version of these maps about 2001 or so, I have used then continually ever since. I wanted a library of USGS topo maps for the state. In particular the 63,360 maps.I had grown tired of buying new maps from the USGS map store every year. That is exactly what I got, plus all of the other USGS topo maps for the state.While it is a bit clunky, you can stitch the maps together for custom coverage of areas located on two or more maps. I print all of my maps on 13x19 sometimes changing the scale to suit me. I have tried several other mainstream topo map products [Garmin, NatGeo, Delorme, etc.] and still prefer my iGage All Topo Alaska set.They do not have all the bells and whistles that some do. But, I was not looking for those and am still not.EDIT:I am retiring sand moving to Hawaii this summer. I just sold the set locally here in Alaska for $75.$25 is not a bad cost for 12 years of use.Note that I only used the original discs to burn copies for everyday use. The original discs were in pristine condition."

69080,1,"I have been using iWork '08 for a little over a month now, and am very pleased. Pages has helped me get several student recommendation letters written very easily. I have prided myself on generating my own formats or templates, but the ones included with Pages are good looking, work well, and are easy to adapt to my individual needs and style. Most of the work I have done has been with Numbers. I maintain a variety of records, and have found the tables in iWork '06 and now '08 useful for many of them, but have been using a very fine open-source software for records which flow better onto a spreadsheet. That is a very fine program with great versatility, but Numbers is even more fluent to use, and as it runs ""native"" and not by means of Java, opening times are speedier. Again, the templates give you a quick start, but can readily be tweaked to suit your individual requirements. The ""Inspector"" approach to accessing various aspects of a document is useful and convenient once learned. A real asset is Numbers' ability to open and edit an Excel file, and then export that work as a file which will be readable with Excel. Pages can do the same with Word. And they do so more readily and successfully than any other programs I have tried. Since Excel and Word are ubiquitous, but also more expensive to put onto a Mac computer than iWork '08, I feel that Apple has scored a bases-loaded home run with that kind of interoperability."
83782,2,"All I wanted to do was to draw 2 long triangles, fill them with color and rotate them. There are no drawing options in this software and no editing features, such as cropping. The logo selections are limited to the predesigned choices in the stock library. From the library you can combine images and then color them to make a graphic. I found the library selections to be quite limited. Better off with LogoSmartz if you want to use pre-designed ""templates"" to work with, however there are no drawing or cropping features in that program either. I downloaded the free trial of that program from CNet (11/07) For drawing purposes, you are better off with Corel draw or Adobe Illustrator. For 3D, I see Google has a new free program! Looks interesting!"

32605,0,"The package should more properly be called &quot;Great Art Museums of Europe&quot;, since there are a lot of great museums that aren't art museums, and a lot of great art museums that aren't in Europe. However, ignoring this technicality, the software is a lot of fun. It includes two CDs that cover major European museums, and three CDs dedicated exclusively to the Louvre. Everything is organized around &quot;tours&quot;, available on a variety of art styles, regions (mostly in Europe, with a special section for the Egyptian collection in the Louvre), and topics (from the Virgin Mary to eroticism). If you aren't looking for anything in particular, it is great to just sit back and let the tours run. If you try to go beyond the tours, however, it is not so good - the interface is navigable, but not intuitive, and the works included are comprehensive at the masterpiece level, but thin out very quickly below the point of &quot;everyone has heard of it&quot;."

That web site suggested this program and the other reviews here made me comfortable with buying the program.I went through the process to write two wills this morning and it was amazingly simple to do.You are asked questions, and if you don't know the exact answers you have the ability to go back at a later date to fill in anything you needed to research. The finished will comes with printed instructions on how to go about signing it and getting it witnessed, and why you need to do what you need to do.This is all very well organized."

Well worth the money!"
52757,1,"[Note: I purchased WordSmith via download from the Internet, not on a CD-ROM.]This is a marvelous product for PDA users with Microsoft Word installed on their &quot;mothership.&quot; Basically, the program enables you to create .rtf documents on your PDA that then can be turned into Word documents with a click or two of the mouse. The user has a number of options regarding how synchronization is handled. It also functions as a document reader which can be set to teleprompter-like scrolling.As the program evolves more and more formatting options can be created on the PDA and transferred home to the mothership. The program is updated often, but upgrades at this point are free. I would recommend checking with the manufacturer to confirm this,but if you buy release 2.0 you ought to be able to upgrade to release 2.1, which supposedly is due to be released at the end of November 2001, without paying any additional cost.If you have this program on your PDA, and a portable keyboard, you may not need a laptop any more."

It's basically the same thing as TurboTax, but not as slick.

10033,0,"Here's the bad news first, because this is the first thing you'll notice: The Mac installer does not work. You'll need to download a replacement installer from Cakewalk. Next bad news: The upgraded installer was not compatible with my installation DVDs because a filename had changed. I had to create a symlink as a workaround. All together I spent over two days trying to figure out how to get the online updates working. I'm still not sure that all of the instruments are working. Cakewalk's support wasn't helpful. I came extremely close to returning this as defective.Days pass before I touch Dimension Pro again. The sound samples are very good. The whole spectrum is covered: classical, pop, rock, metal, silly, and strange. Most instruments are built from real samples processed with modulation, distortion, effects, EQ, and reverb. Virtually any instrument or sound can be built in the same manner. Customizing instrument sounds starts out overwhelming then eases into a fun addiction.The user interface is very simple but not entirely intuitive. Every word of the brief manual must be read for it to make sense. Even so, some instruments use features never described in the paper manual. Drums are sorely lacking a customized interface. Custom drum kits can be created by editing SFZ control files but for now I'll use Logic's kits.Dimension Pro is an excellent upgrade to round out the limited instruments bundled with Garage Band or Logic Express. Integration is seamless, if you can get it installed in the first place."

30164,1,The camera is good for first time digital users the piturce quality needs improvement but its workable and for the price the software alone is a deal. The camera has two resolution setting with 600 x 800 for 8 pictures and 400 x 600 for 28 picture the r1 and r2 setting and ytou have to careful not to hit Clr on the menu since it will erase you pictures. The rubberize grip feels great and the thunb rest is a grest idea. The self-timer is a pain so I turn mines off but I guess it to taste how to set up the camera. All so you can add a MultiMedia Memory Card to expand you picture capabilty. Currently I have a SanDisk 8 mb card in and can take over 80 pictures regularally. I had a problem using the serial cable with my laptop but the USB cable works great and the software works with my more other digtal cameras as well.
58860,1,"My oldest son has been playing baseball every since his little hands could hold a bat. If you ask him what he wants to be when he grows up, his answer is always &quot;a baseball player&quot; so it was no surprise to me that when he saw the software for Backyard Baseball that he would want to buy it.As much as I LOVE baseball myself, I really had no interest in learning the video game. After time however, I found myself asking questions and coming to an understanding that there was more to meet the eye than just your average virtual baseball game.The first concept about this game that is really cute is there are 2 different stages and different levels. You can play t-ball or your standard little league baseball game. I thought that was a great addition to have both versions in one game because my little one can play this game as well and understand the concept since he too is in the t-ball league.The second thing about this that makes it appealing to children is the different baseball fields the games take place in. Sometimes it's your typical baseball field, other times they're playing in a make shift baseball field out in a lot, a school baseball diamond, there are several and they're all very unique.The third thing that I personally like is the kids that are in the game that play the baseball players are all racially diverse. There is even a player who is in a wheelchair but has one heck of a throwing arm! ;)My husband really likes the fact that the game allows you to not only PLAY the game, but to also be the coach of the teams you select. Your child will actually pick the players on your team based on the players stats, and create a play list. You have a baseball schedule and everything and my son printed his out and played the games according the schedule like any other baseball game. His learning knowledge of how a team is put together was taught in a way we never could have explained.After you play your team scheduled games, there is a little league series complete with a trophy for your child to print out!I strongly recommend this game for every little baseball player or baseball player to be. My God-daughter also has this game and she loves it, so it's not just for boys. So give this one a try, I can guarantee you'll score a homerun for the person you buy this for!!! ;)"
7279,1,kids loved it. fast delivery. need to order another one for them to take home.
46167,1,The Best. I have used 5 different Image editors that most people get with cameras and scanners. None compare. Fill Flash can save a picture that the others can't help. Worth the learning curve.Recent Amazon prices after rebates make Elements hard to resist.The training CD currently available for free is well done (it only covers a few subjects). Those that can just try every feature and learn that way will not be let down. Hint books are helpful with combining features to accomplish specific goals. Adobe has some good free tutorials online.
18598,2,"The support of this product is very poor. The first question from the company is about the customer's credit card number even if the product was just bought and it does not do what is described in the manual.

I am familiar with financial programs and accounting but after trying to use the program for two weeks I gave up and decided to return it."

The only drawback is that you only get to redecorate the castle. There is no variation to the tasks so that once you've completed the castle, if you want to play again, you do exactly what you had done before but there is a great deal of variety and combinations for decorating the castle. It is like a very sophisticated coloring book."

12266,2,"When I bought my new dell machine this year, Windows XP was the only choice of OS I had and Dell assured me that XP is well received by customers.I had already heard the scary stories about XP but I was still not prepeared for the horrors that XP unleashed once the initial setup was completed. The look and feel it gives your computer is certainly different, but its capability to do multiple tasks while maintaining system integrity is seriously flawed.I do not know how this piece of garbage was released for public consumption.Here are all the positives and negatives I ahve encountered with XP in last 6 months:Positives:NoneNegatives:1) Very unstable. Unless you only launch your IE or some other basic applications that come with the system, you are in serious trouble. The system becomes unresponsive and I have to cut the power and remove the battery to restart it. Sometimes (like just now) I had to restart 5 times before I could log in.2) Incompatible with most software out there. If you want to install basic music software, virus protection, firewall etc, be prepared for further system issues at startup type. XP doesn't handle anything but microsoft's software.3) No gaming support. Despite what MS claims, XP is incapable of handling most gaming software. It keeps crashing everytime you run a game with heavy graphics.CONCLUSION: Microsoft is forcing people to but XP by making it available for every new PC. And despite what most people believe, it is not for free. Your PC maker includes the cost in your final statement. You cannot remove it because that voids your warranty. The fact that MS allowed such incompetency makes me question their future direction. No wonder they are losing ground to Linux. It is free and more stable than XP."

65038,1,"After playing around with this thing for a while, I use it for my Novell GroupWise address book but nothing else. Actually, you must synchronize through it for everything, but for all of the other applications I just tell it to synchronize with my Palm desktop, as before. I could use it for other applications; I just don't, because I ran into more trouble (with GroupWise, not with Intellisync) than it's worth. This product tries to do a lot, synchronizing with a variety of different applications (e.g., Outlook). You probably wouldn't be interested in this at all if you weren't using some application other than Palm desktop already. This leads to unavoidable complexity, with all the different tricks and quirks involved in the several applications supported. I don't know that anyone could improve significantly upon the way Intellisync copes with this, applying common sense and providing just about the right number of options (more would just add perhaps unnecessary additional complexity). But don't buy this unless you are prepared to spend at least a moderate amount of time mastering details, reading the manual or at least systematic trial and error, etc."
59261,1,"Being a Linux virgin, I was pleased my installation for this Suse 8.0 distro went smoothly: all hardware detected and installed without a hitch, as is normal for a Win 2000 Pro install. But I always start with the bare minimum of cards in place, to minimise any hassle with network cards and internal modems. Also, all my cards are brands such as D-Link, Matrox, and Creative Labs, which makes driver availability more likely. I was surprised to see the Axion monitor range so well supported.With Suse 8.0 installed, I had a pretty complete system with Star Office, a web browser/e-mailer, Acrobat Reader 4.05, and many other sundries including a CD burning application. Another software load gave me The Gimp for image editing. All in all, you've got a very useable system.The downside: The launching of the computer and Star office is comparatively slow. On the 850Mhz Celeron fitted with 128MB of RAM, that I was using, the Win 2000 Pro and associated applications flew along, unlike Suse, which performed about as well as Win 2000 Pro on a P100. And the software options are limited. So no Photoshop, Acrobat, or Dreamweaver, etc.The Upside: For not a lot of money, and installed on an up-to-date machine, anyone can now have a Linux based PC without the pain, and have enough applications and webability for most circumstances.Although you can't install Adobe Acrobat, you can use the system's GhostScript application to make PDFs that are compatible. You are also supplied with the discs to set up a sever and fit it with firewall features.Suse 8.0 would be a viable proposition for educational and community work where the cost of workstation/server Microsoft licenses is too much to be budgeted for, but where high performance, stability, and simple and cost effective upgrading is required.Whilst the Suse part of the equation is inexpensive I would recommend that sensible dollars be spent on the hardware to minimise disappointments. It's amazing how much grief is encountered for the sake of the (money) not spent, you thought looked to be a good idea at the time."
22002,1,"My kids love this game. It is easy for them to use. Both my 5 yr old and 8 yr old play without any problem. The game is squeaky clean so there is no problem with questionable language, innuendo etc. like some other games. This game is absolutely worth the money! Buy it."
85905,1,"First off, let me say that I have been using DarkBASIC since 2005. I then switched to DarkBASIC Pro around 2008. It's features and flexibility allow me to stick to this language only and not have to rely on other languages. It's constantly updated, the community is insane with knowledge and help without the 'troll' comments.This is a programming language, not a drag and drop do everything for me system. Bottom line really is this. If you want to make a game in YOUR vision you will have to learn some scripting and or programming. Bottom line. DarkBASIC Pro shines in the area of game development. I have also created software for the U.S Military using this product.It contains many features, and also has addons and extension packages if you need further power. Such as physics, collisions, and artificial intelligence. If you are wanting a step into game programming, or even programming in general check out DarkBASIC/Pro, take the time to learn it, and create your masterpiece!What do the negative comments say here? 'oh my I actually have to learn programming' 'oh my this isnt a do everything for me' engine. Where are my models, music and sounds? It does come with samples that are commented that you can learn from. There is literally hundreds of youtube tutorials, and the community is full of information. Also available here on Amazon, and through multiple websites is printed books!Have fun, and create games and software using DarkBASIC Pro. It's easy!"
3182,0,"The program is a very effective teaching tool. The combination of visual and audio cues make the lessons easy to remember. But I am puzzled by their choice of the things they teach first. If you're thinking of actually using some of the stuff you learn in the first several units on a trip to Mexico, forget it. Most of it is really impractical, unlike the Pimsleur CDs which I really like. For example, Rosetta will teach you early on ""The boy is running. The horse is eating a carrot"" while Pimsleur prefers things like ""I want to drink a beer. How much is it?"" for early lessons. As you can see, the practicality of the latter far exceeds that of the former. Proably because Pimsleur focuses on statements involving ""I"" and ""You"" instead of the 3rd person. You learn vocabulary faster with Rosetta. But ignoring the possibility that you will be called upon to describe horses eating carrots, if you want to use what you learn any time soon, try Pimsleur."

76687,1,"I'll be honest. I made the choice of picking Picture It Photo Premium 9 over Adobe Photo Element 2.0 solely because of the big price difference. Plus, Microsoft's rebate has no conditions attached, whereas Adobe's requires you own a previous version of the same product.Now that I've used it for a while, I'm happy to say I'm quite satisfied with Picture It Photo Premium 9 (PIPP9 henceforth) running on my Windows XP Home laptop. Previously I played with a couple different versions of Picture It but never became a serious fan, relying on Photoshop mostly for picture editing. But with PIPP9, I now have a simple-to-use, one-stop shop program for all my digital imaging needs.Unlike the other MS offerings (Digital Image Pro and a deluxe version of that), PIPP9 emphases simplicity, so you won't find advanced editing tools like white balance adjustment and tint/hue adjustment as in Digital Image Pro. It's fine for me because I also have Photoshop. If you think you'll be doing a lot of manual editing, but not on the advanced-advanced level of Photoshop, you may want to get Digital Image Pro instead.That said, here are some of the tools that I find tremendously well done in PIPP9.1. Rule of thirds cropping guidelines. The first step in editing a photo (after making a backup copy of the original file, of course), is to re-orient it if necessary and crop it. (Crop carefully and don't lose anything you think you might need. You can always do a final crop at the very end of your editing process.) PIPP9 shows the ""rule of thirds"" grid so you can crop the photo properly. For those not familiar with this rule, it states your primary subject in the picture should be positioned at one of the intersections of three horizontal and three vertical lines running through the picture (like tic-tac-toe). For most personal photos, this rule allows a well-balanced picture in terms of subject positioning.2. Batch file processing. After I download pictures from my digital camera, they have names like ""DSCF001.JPG"", ""DSCF002.JPG"", etc. PIPP9 lets me change the names all at once easily.3. Auto level and contrast adjustments. I always let the program do some auto-adjusting first. With my Minolta Dimage F300 camera, it already gives the best machine-picked brightness and contrast, but I run PIPP9's auto tools anyway to be sure. Then I manually adjust the settings in Photoshop if necessary -- which is rare these days.4. Picture straightening. This is not new but improved. Basically it corrects crooked pictures. Especially handy for scanned photos.5. Picture sharpening and other effects. I do sharpening in the end because it affects contrast. Dido for other effects such as white balancing which I manually do in Photoshop if necessary (again, not often).6. Finally I save. PIPP9 also lets me easily resize my photos for my Palm, my old Pocket PC, and even my Sanyo 8100 cell phone. The quality of the shrunk pictures is better than in previous versions.Without listing every single feature I use often, let me just say that compared to other programs, PIPP9 is easy to use, has an attractive interface, and offers almost all the digital tools you'll need for photo editing. (Unless you are a total pro in which case Photoshop is still your only choice.) Performance is fast and reliable, and the end products look excellent. And, not the least, the price is totally right for home users.One thing PIPP9 is not good at (other than the lack of sophisticated editing tools) is organizing photos. Microsoft has another program for you (Digital Image Pro, which includes PIPP9 and Photo Library). But I use Picasa which is great for organizing and sharing my huge collection of photos.In summary, PIPP9 is perfect for home users who want the simplest way to enhance their digital images."

It was such a jump from the first. I had to use books to learn all the in between stuff. I went on to put the 3rd CD in. It was HORRILBE! I've been learning Germa long enough to know that the speaker doesn't even seem to be pronouncing the words right. It seems like he/she is reading them for the first time. They sound absolutely nothing or authentic to what I have been learning already. i.e. I typed in 'bitte' and it's supposed to sound like 'bitter' with a silient 'r'. But the speaker pronounces it in a english sound, 'bit'. That's one example of many. If someone has an explanation about this let me know. Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be. I was really disappointed in this CD."

NOt FOR KIDS UNDER 9! OR EVEN HIGHER!!!!It is still fun though. You play as Juni looking for his sister Carmen who is stuck in a video game. If you saw the movie then you will get this. If you didnot then forget it.This game is really confusing and challenging. MABEY THAT'S WHY THERE ARE ONLY 3 LEVELS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OMG, lol.I was really hoping it would be in 3-D!

63546,1,"This version of turbo tax is once again very good. I would not be able to do my own taxes without it. Some things I've noticed after running some numbers; The premier edition provides extra help for investing but the interview does not have a specific section for put and call options. There is help in the online documentation which is useful but I would have liked to have it in the interview. Also, I still have to do some manual calculations to deal with the taxable portion of my state tax refund. That seems like something that should be taken care of in the interview. It affects a large percentage of users. I'm also not crazy about the new license key and having to register online before using all the features. I wonder what will happen when I upgrade my OS and I have to reinstall the program. It might not let me since I've already registered with the product key online.Still, the other features are very good. It handles ESPP and company stock options well. I rely on it heavily for year end tax planning and for filing my return online. Consistently a very good product."

One extremely irritating addition to the latest version is ""Mr. Clippet"" or ""Clippy"", a cartoon animation that pops-up whenever the user needs to search the help index. If the user is consulting the help menu, he or she is probably already somewhat frustrated. The user doesn't need some dancing, dumb-ass cartoon as a distraction. Keep it professional! It also wouldn't hurt Microsoft's reputation if they were to make their program compatible with some of the other Word processing programs out there. For example, Star Office allows the import of MS Word documents, but Word doesn't allow the import of Star Office documents. Come on, Bill, play fair!"

Adobe wants you to go out and pay extra for the same features that comes standard on CorelDraw.Illustrator does not have the ability to allow one to scan in an image. Separate scanning software is required. Corel has built in the scanning utility right into CorelDraw.Adobe's Photoshop is a great product for photo and pixel based work, but CorelDraw is number one as far as vector-based illustration software goes."

To date it has worked fine, it is easy to use (user friendly), makes images very fast, and has no limits on the size of image files. Norton Ghost would span files larger than 2 gigabytes. Considering that the NTFS filing system is becoming more common, Drive Image 7 satisfies the need to image hard drives in NTFS."

46640,2,"This information is all available from the US Govt. The trick is to have software that will display it easily and with no hassles. First some background before I get started. I became a programmer in 1970. My first computer was an Epson QX10, an 8 bit CP/M machine from the early 80's. The reason for giving you a peek at my background is what I have to say about this software. It is, without a doubt, the worst example ofprogramming I have encountered since owning my first PC. I could list the problems and their lack of attention to detail and their seemingly complete unconcern for bringing to market a product with all the loose ends tied and that has the primary purpose of making the program that is easy to set up and use but I have neither the time nor desire to present you with a multi-page review that would waste your time reading the details of bad programming practice. My advice is this; consider this your last choice when shopping for GPS compatible software. Let the buyer beware. Note: I was going to give it one star but decided to give it 2 since it does work. We have to save one star things that absolutely do not work."

When the Spotlight icon stops ""pulsing"" you'll know it is done.(2) I bought the Family Pack & have one non-DVD-capable Mac. To install the Tiger on this older Mac, I'll need to use the Firewire target disk mode workaround - search Apple support forums for details...

To accomplish this, they have to play various math games to free their friends and get the pieces. They get basic math skill practice and have fun doing it.

There are always little surprises, that might make you flinch a little, when they pop up. And don't forget if you're in a pinch to use a lifeline and phone a friend!The Graphics are very good on the Nancy games, and offer enough challenges to keep older players interested, while not overwhelming younger players at the same time.I really like the diversity offered in the Nancy Drew games, it's nice to see people of all different backgrounds represented, something usually lacking in most other games.With the book and necklace this collectors set would make a great gift for any Nancy fan, or is a nice way to introduce new players to the Nancy games.Can't wait for the next one!"

To me, it just seems something in that department is sadly absent with the new games. However, this game is exciting and......educational? Well yes, I'll freely admit that you might actually learn something, which is more than I can say for those seek and find games, where hunting miniscule picsols seems to be the main theme. Here, we have a mystery set in a theme park enivronment, with plenty of people to interview and a plot that keeps rolling. I remember particulary playing the carousel game and trying to get the ring, which took me seemingly forever.Overall, this a great game that makes me miss the earlier Nancy Drew games."

7115,1,"Microsoft has many enemies. That's what happens when you are #1 and many below you wish they could be at the top.Vista is a solid product. It was not as solid the day it was released, but what is? It's now only been a few months and the updates that apply the moment you install or upgrade to Vista provide you with a smooth experience.Is the interface different? Oh yea. Is it bad? Is it slow? No. It's fine. Vista runs only SLIGHTLY slower on an older PC with a Pentium III chip or older but why wouldn't you expect that? You can't get more features AND more power and expect a faster machine when your hardware is getting along in the years.In addition, if you simply don't understand the nature of Vista, then you haven't yet read Greg Perry's ""Sams Teach Yourself Microsoft Windows Vista All in One"" (AmazonSams Teach Yourself Microsoft Windows Vista All in One (Sams Teach Yourself)) and frankly, this is hands-down the best way for a newcomer - even if you are or are not comfortable with XP - to master EVERYthing you REALLY need to know about Vista.Software is not always obvious. That does not mean it's bad or difficult to use or requires a huge learning curve. Once you get Vista, beg or borrow or buy ""Sams Teach Yourself Microsoft Windows Vista All in One"" and you will be ready to become a MASTER at the product. I went through what YOU are going through and I know most Vista books and sites DO NOT give you what you need to make this product work well FOR YOU. This book does and I've read all the top-selling Vista books.Now I don't care if you get ""Sams Teach Yourself Microsoft Windows Vista All in One"" or not, although you should, but you need to stop listening to the hype of those who have axes to grind with Microsoft. If you want to move FORWARD with your computer you need to have the juice needed which means a moderately recent PC and you need Vista.The number one reason for getting Ultimate and not a lower Vista product is the BitLocker encryption technology and the ability to make a ghosted image of your disk drive that Vista can restore. If you've used Symantec's DriveImage or Ghost products then you know these alone can run you more than $50. It's thrown in with Vista Ultimate and you'll REALLY use these tools a lot."

It is a memory hog, far too focussed on digital audio/video support (yet doesn't have built-in DVD decoders), not supportive of any driver software more than a few years old (and the drivers it has itself are VERY basic), does not include IIS, therefore cannot support Visual Studio or VS.NET in any of its forms. Furthermore it freezes up and crashes on the simplest of tasks (usually involving Internet Explorer). This comes standard in most home PCs and unfortunately the upgrade isn't cheap. I'll go back to Windows 2000 - it was far more stable and robust."
86257,0,"I've been a cautious fan of NUM since very early versions. I try not to be the first on my block to scan my hard disks - only to find a serious flaw fix posted on the net - after my disk/data has been corrupted. Once the product settles down, its very good.I have a G4-867 with both OS9.2 and OSX installed. Recently while running my NUM 6.x under OS9.2, i found a 'serious error in B-tree with Mach...' Not wanting to mess up my OSX files with an older OS9 utility I upgraded to NUM 7.0Good? well no. You see, if you have a serious problem, you are instructed to boot off the NUM 7.0 cd-rom - which runs NUM 6.03!So, its a nice thing that we have NUM 6.x - however, I don't see the point of why I would upgrade to NUM 7.0. In the manual on page 14 there is a graph indicating when you could use NUM 7 under OSX: filesaver, unerase, disk doctor (see above). that's it.If you have NUM 6 - stick with it. If you don't, consider picking up NUM 7 - since it has v. 6 too."
32509,1,"If I were to compare this to other Blu-Ray 3D content and my opinion is only about the 3D, then I have to say this is a average title, much like the Hubble 3D.IMO any of the outside space scenes are awesome, inside shuttle and ISS are good and the rest is ok.The subject matter on the other hand is great! So if you are picking this up both because you want to see a documentary on the ISS AND you want the experience to be enhanced by 3D, get it! If you are getting it to be blow away by 3D alone, then it might not be the best choice."
1970,1,"This is one of my besy and favorite Operating System yet to come! Windows Millennium Edition is truly a consumer edtion of all Windows! Well...I bought a computer, that had Windows XP Home Edition on it already. But, I made a choice and put Millennium Edition on it. Windows Me not only comes with programs specially designed for Home Computing, it comes with faster start up times which I really like. I play all my music on Windows Me, and it never has a problem! My Pictures is a great new Document Folder! It comes with a program called &quot;Windows Picture Viewer&quot;. But, I heard that some people were having problems with software. And I might just know what it is! If you have an internet connection, and first installed Windows Millennium Edition, and just did all the updates at onec, then there might be your problem! Windows Me isn't Windows 2000 code, it is still Win. 9x code! Which in Win.9x it is not a s stable. I waited at least a few days, then did them. Also, see if your hardware on what kind it is. Some hardware, such as some cameras might not work. Just always be sure to check with your Hardware Vendor and see if it's compadible. And, one more solution, just like I said with the updates, don't install you programs so fastly at one time! You Operating System could do better! So...conlusions are, Windows Me is great and recommend this Operating system for consumers! Just work with it, and have fun with it!"
16049,0,"I purchased Garmin City Navigator Europe NT for a recent trip to the UK and France. It was as all Garmin disks somewhat a pain to load and unlock. Once on my computer, it was another project to transfer data to my GPS. This software has so many layers (a strength AND weakness) that loads of useless information can make a tiny GPS screen overwhelmed by ""Points of Interest"" of all kinds. I must have inadvertently checked (or it was defaulted) routing to avoid toll roads, the fastest way to get around in France. This left us on some wild backroad adventuring thru the countryside of Normandy. All in all, travelling in a country where ones grasp of the native language is limited (me-French), it was an invaluable tool."
56407,0,"I spent a total of $9 on this when CompUSA was going out of business. I have used only the Japanese portion of the software, but it also has Chinese.The Good: The flash cards, many (but not all) include Kanji and Kana writing. They include spoken examples (with a 'slow' option so you can really listen closely) and do a great job of training vocab in a fairly fun way.The bad (OK actually): The immersion environment didn't feel all that immersive to me. It also had the same slow function so you can really hear what they are saying. Overall, I found the exercises to be beneficial, but I feel like they aren't nearly as beneficial as they could be.The Ugly: The driving disks were so cheesy I couldn't stand to listen to them for more than 1/2 of one entry. Also, I doubt this software package will teach me Japanese by itself. I consider this to be one of my many tools to teach me Japanese.Conclusion: If you can find it for cheap, get it. The flash cards are totally worth it if you are a beginner, and the immersion section will definitely help the more advanced learners. Don't expect this to teach you Japanese but it will probably help. (No comment on the Chinese portion)"

I was ecstatic when the gingerbread guy asked ""Easy or (a little bit) Harder?""

The only problem that this program takes up most of the memory and even if I got the computer which has a whopping heap of unused memory, Mavis Beacons gobbles it eventually as if it is hungry for more. The graphic, when used on the older computer is slow and cumbersome, but if you want to find a better typing software that uses only half of the memory, I'd keep on searching."

20560,1,"UPDATED REVIEW: I went to check on my first project (at 4 am I cancelled the &quot;rendering&quot; of a 35 min. dvd burn, as it was stuck on the last scene for 3 hours), and lo and behold, it came out great. Now, I didn't add menus or sound, and only a few graphics. But I did edit various scenes, and I was quite concerned it would get &quot;stuck&quot; rendering. The video quality was very, very good, the sound excellent, and quite frankly, I'm pleased with my purchase. I hope not to encounter the problems others have in future projects, but for what it's worth, the software has worked beautifully for me."
20400,1,"I just completed a 15 day trip through Italy and Greece using AutoRoute. The other key components are the Pharos GPS-500 USB receiver and a Laptop. The software installs without issues and worked well throughout my trip. It is pretty accurate and worked even in the most remote places. It has many features that I did not use like tracking fuel economy and setting way points. You can select many languages and metric versus miles. I simply put in my target address and checked the provide guidance box and off I went!There were a couple of minor issues during the trip. On long multi hour drives the software would hang up. Not sure why - could have been a laptop issue also? Simple fix was to close and restart the program.The other issue is accuracy. There were time when it said "" right turn in 500 feet"" and the turn was much closer and you would miss it. It's not a big deal because it also shows you a detailed map with street names so you can quickly adjust. This could be an issue with the GPS receiver or restriction by the government.Anyways - I recommend this product and will use it again.Cheers,chuckp"
17759,1,My 4 yo daughter began playing this at the Apple store while waiting for us. She loved it so much we bought it before we left.There are parts she can do all by herself and parts difficult enough to require help from Mom + Dad. Which I think of as good. It gives her a sense of accomplishment and is challenging enough to require our help and allow her to grow with the game.Look at it like this...it's better than TV.
45237,1,"I give Sony Vegas 5 stars because I do fairly serious video production, and it's the only ""consumer priced"" video edit program that gives results similar to Final Cut Pro or even (dare I say it) Avid. For those who want ""instant video,"" this is a one-star item, and you shouldn't buy it.Vegas takes time to learn, which is why I say it's not good for people who want to take shaky shots of the kids' parties. That crowd ought to look at Magix Move Edit Pro 11, which will do a ""one click"" jazzy-looking movie that makes even fairly bad footage into something sort of worth watching -- and doesn't crash nearly as often as Pinnacle/ULead.etc. MEP is also good for underpowered computers - I use it to ""field edit"" shots I grab at conferences and need to get up on my employer's sites that day with my aging ThinkPad.But if you are serious about video, Sony Vegas is worth learning. I like it far better than the $$ version of Premiere. And if I suddenly want to make more complicated pieces, I can always spring $430 (more or less) for an upgrade to the ""pro"" version, which allows more tracks and such. the upgrade price is $426. Maybe... maybe...OH - I can do HDV (hi def) with Vegas -- the $120 consumer version -- and it's the only program that will currently handle the full 1080i output from my Sony HDR-HC1. That alone is marvelous, even though my 3 GHz HP box is just a little underpowered for that many pixels per frame."
47389,1,"This item offers a basic bilingual dictionary and some tricky games as well.By using the dictionary, the first thing that catches your attention is the grey background on which bright words in yellow, blue, green, violet and red lie to be read. All entries have IPA transcriptions in bright green, and a yellow loudspeaker offers their pronunciations. Useful information follow in dark blue.If you think to be extremely good at a foreign language, just try the crosswords, but mind you, if you are unable to finish them and you click on the white flag, a voice will tell you how bad you are! So, I'll advise you to start with the ""learning mode"" where a list of terms appears for you to study - and you not only get their translations, but also their meanings and pronunciations. Once you have studied the list of terms, you are ready to try the crosswords as well as the ""shooting gallery,"" a game where you have to type quite fast the translations of the words shown in green on a blackboard. The software continues to repeat the game till you have memorized all the words. If you do it well, you'll get some applause.The software recognizes different users, and you can sign in your name to have your efforts memorized and displayed in colourful graphs!I'll advise all foreign languages students to try it. It's a way to improve their knowledge by means of interesting and quite difficult games."

Buy the program alone.The additional cd's are a waste of space, money and time. Even the program to search the cd's take a long time and do not actually provide you with data.

61825,1,"""Apps"" are now the great rage for mobile devices, but they had actually been around for some time.WebEyes was produced independently at least over six years ago, perhaps longer. It is now available like much software on a CD ROM.The original format, which is this reviewer acquired those many years ago had to be downloaded over the Internet from the private site of the developer.That original format is still installed on one of the reviewer' him and him and s desktop computers and is used for reading and reviewing archived files (documents) that were downloaded using Internet Explorer.This application is useful only with Internet Explorer. It can be used with documents that have been downloaded using that browser. It it does not function with files in PDF format and has not been tested by this reviewer for application with other browsers.The great advantage of this app is that it can: enlarge the fonts (type size), arrange the text into columns, and convert the order into pages that ""turn"" in book format, eliminating the need for scrolling. The use of the columnar format both eases and speeds reading, particularly for documents whose text stretches across the entire computer screen. Anyone who does extensive reading on a computer screen in HTML format, using the Internet Explorer browser can benefit greatly from using this particular application.It appears that the original developer sold this particular application to the current producers and distributors. As a result, the current distributors do not provide any support for any issues that users may encounter. Fortunately, no issues have been encountered so far as this reviewer is aware. The original application seems to provide a slightly wider range of electives in terms of columnar presentation and methods of pagination (page turning). But for those who do much of this particular kind of reading this is a very worthwhile application and assist greatly reduces eye fatigue."

15771,1,"Even though I have done a lot of writing in my life, I had never written a complete screenplay. I've had lots of ideas, but had never written them down. I finally decided to get some of these ideas out on paper. I knew from talking with friends who already work in the industry that script readers are very particular when it comes to the format of a screenplay and that one formatting error can cause someone to throw away an otherwise wonderful script. I considered other screenwriting software, but after speaking with my industry insider friends and doing other research I felt that FINAL DRAFT was the best software to get. I've been using FINAL DRAFT 7 for awhile now and have not had any problems with it. For writing screenplays, I love this software. I have not had any trouble with the software not loading and I've not lost anything I've ever written (though I tend to save a lot of my work frequently anyway). I've read most of the other reviews about FINAL DRAFT 7 on Amazon and it seems that people either really like the software or they hate it. I fall into the former category and have found it quite useful. For a beginning screenwriter, it works wonderfully. The only downside I have with the software is that it is quite expensive. As an educator, I was able to get a discount. FINAL DRAFT offers a discount for students, educators, and military personnel, but if you're not able to get that discount then the software is about double the cost that it should be."
67765,1,"My sister and I are planning a trip to California. Since we have never driven ourselves there before, I bought this program to help us know where to go. It has taken a few weeks of playing with it to really find my way aroung in this program but, that's probably just me. It is a great tool for planning not only your route but for details along the way. It gives you names and locations of all sorts of points of interest like historical sites and museums as well as restaurants and hotels with addresses, phone numbers and average cost...Everything! And if you have kids to travel with, it even has games for different ages, up to adults, that you can print out and take along. If you want or need a lot of help in planning a trip or finding a location, I would say this is it."

I have always liked the flow of the software and have gotten used to the &quot;upgrades&quot; Intuit has put into it. I have to say, after using 2002 for awhile now, 2004 is a lot different. However, I think this version is fine and I will get used to the changes in it. There are no pop-ups for Intuit products and I haven't run into any bugs. I would like to point out, I didn't upgrade from a my previous version. I made backups of my files and uninstalled all of 2002(Windows Uninstaller and deleted directories). When I installed 2004 it transfered all the old information into the new program and has worked fine."

The cards were nice, but I did not like the fact that there wasn't any other options to change the sayings in the card. You had to type your own, there were no other suggestions."
15802,1,If you want your screenplay to look like an industry standard screenplay then FD7 will do exactly just that. It is also simple to use and the learning curve is like 10 minutes. It is so easy to format a screenplay that you will no longer need to pay attention to the format - really. It is almost impossible to print a script that is in a bad format or where there are mistakes in the format. Once you understand how it works your ideas will flow from you brain and will almost automatically format themselves correctly on the page making this a must for any screenplay writer. However FD7 will not write you a good screenplay! But it goes without saying that this onus is on you.However this package is a waaaaaay toooooo expensive!!! Please lower the cost of this thing by a $100. People need software like this for school theatre work and other community scribes.
22482,0,"The back up routine is buggy. It leaves a file name Q3.DIR as a stray on your desktop even after you told it to back up to a certain media device elsewhere. Each time you go to back up, a message pops up asking you if you know that there is a file with the same name and do you want to over write it. There is a box you can click if you do not want to see this screen and question again. Clicking this box does nothing.. Other then these few back up problems the program seems to be working ok. I haven't had time to check the math yet but it looks ok. If Quicken 2003 was working ok for you Save your time and money until intuit fixes the few back up bugs and what ever else may come up with this new program. The layout looks the same as the 2003 version with very few changes."
26517,1,"Space Quest 4 is a wonderful entry in a series about the bumbling, world-saving janitor, Roger Wilco. In this game, Roger finds himself shot into the future, where he must save the future from *gasp* Sludge Vohaul, who has his data saved on a computer. It's up to Roger to stop Sludge and his villainous ""Sequel Policemen"" and to save the future from what it has become.This is a great game. It's a point and click adventure game where you control Roger Wilco. You have talk, touch, smell, lick, and walk functions, which you use to navigate the games. Well, actually the smell and lick functions are more like humorous side notes rather than things you do to progress in the game, but they're still funny.There are a lot of puzzling challenges in this game, and it's a game both me and my brother had to figure out together. It challenges your mind without being too complex, as long as you don't spoil the experience with a walkthrough. One of the hardest challenges is figuring out how to get past the Sequel Policemen in the mall, and even to this day I find those policemen more intimidating than most other baddies I've seen in a video game. Of course, failures are pretty funny, and like all Space Quest games, there are assorted ways to get yourself killed, each accompanied by a snarky comment from your narrator.The only real trouble with this game is that you need DOS BOX to play it, as it's so old it doesn't work on modern computers. Still, that's not a big deal, and DOS BOX is free. Enjoy this game and enjoy the good ol' days of the nineties."

It could have been funnier, if anybody had cared."
39434,0,"I tried the demo of Pinnacle before settling on Screenblast. Screenblast is much more stable and easy to do the basics. Although Pinnicle seemed to have a few features that Screenblast did not have, most of them are really not important. (For example, Pinnacle can do storyboarding, were Screenblast can not.)The biggest plus that I saw (besides the fact that it does not crash every 5 minutes like Pinnacle) was the Pan and crop feature. This allows you to pan/crop a shot. This is great for adding 'animation' to your still photos, as well as other effects for video.The biggest draw back is clearly the DVD creation. My Studio 4.5 is included and is a very weak software. The two are not integrated, so if you want to creat a DVD with multiple chapters, you have to go back through the camera. It is very disappointing.Overall, this is a decent product compared to its peers, but still has a few holes."

15646,1,"I upgraded to the 7.0 version when I moved to Vista. Works FANTASTIC. One tip: Before purchasing, I was out reading reviews on this product and there were a couple of posts where users were complaining about the product taking over all media related actions. To avoid this you must read all of the screens while performing install. Towards the end of installation, you will be given a screen to choose which actions you want Nero to automatically handle, if any."

46653,0,"I wanted to use TOPO to map the trails in the parks around South Eastern VA. by importing the GPS tracks obtained from walking/riding the trails. TOPO would almost do what I wanted, but its disappointing lack of editing and viewing tools made it impossible to accurately draw or display the routs.If I import the tracks as individual waypoints, the waypoints are displayed as HUGE diamonds on the map that overlap and make it impossible to follow the track. The max zoom is insufficient to clearly display the tracks, but the magnify option zooms in nicely. The only problem is the magnify option also magnifies the waypoint icons, so they still overlap. For the Mid-Atlantic map, these waypoint diamonds are about 200 feet corner to corner.If I bring the tracks in as complete routs, there is no way to make small changes to fit the track to the minor inconsistencies in the elevation map. For example, when the GPS shows me walking a mostly flat section and TOPO has me descending into a ravine; if I remember navigating around the edge of the ravine, it's obvious the track in that area needs to be tweaked to miss the ravine. I might be able to draw a new track if the lines of the existing track were a little thinner, but as with the waypoints, at max magnify the lines are very thick and obscure the topo lines. When I try to start a new track, the draw tool functions as a track selector over the existing (too thick) track, so I can't correct what is already there. The only option is to delete small sections of the map and try to redraw them from memory or a print out. This process might work, but I think I could do it a lot faster in a paint program.There doesn't seem to be any way to turn off a waypoint or track display completely, since all the waypoints are ultimately displayed in the &quot;All Waypoints&quot; master list which won't turn off. Strangely, if I delete a waypoint in a custom rout, the waypoint is also deleted from the master list, so once a waypoint is added to a rout it can't be removed without also removing it from the entire map.Overall it's a nice program and probably works fine for mapping out long, straight paths. It's useless for my purposes, though. They need to add some better editing and viewing features, such as interactive rout editing with drag handles on the waypoints, and some control over how and when the waypoints are displayed."

I had bought Rocket Spanish which is loadable to an IPOD or MP3 player, but found that only listening (I'm a visual learner) was not helping me understand the grammatical concepts or helping my retention.Yes, you have to use your computer to review lessons but you have to do that with just about any program, including Rocket Spanish. You get CD's to listen to and a convenient carrying case. Keep those in the car. Each CD corresponds to a lesson. Review the lesson and complete the exercises for reinforcement, then listen in the car to learn aurally. The audio CD's review pronounciation and quiz you on recently learned concepts. I find that when I go back to my Rocket Spanish MP3 lessons that they now make sense because I can visualize the words and have a better understanding of the grammatical structure of Spanish. I find the computer based lessons more accessible than Rocket Spanish. But, the programs complement each other. I suggest ordering the free CD directly from the Visual Link website to get a feel for the program. Chances are you will get an email offer that will reduce the price to around $99 the same as Rocket Spanish. You will then get additional offers for Level II that reduce the cost by 50% ($49.99).They now have Level II and a complementary on-line program that goes deeper into the grammar, prounciation, and conjugation of Spanish verbs.As far as the one review stating you have CD's and this is a pain. Just load them onto your computer then upload them to your MP3. I find that simply popping them in to my CD player is great. Each time I start a new lesson, I think there is no way I can remember all this new vocabularly, but by the end of the lesson, I pretty much have everything stored in my memory bank! I really enjoy this program."
24400,2,I purchased the Oregon Trail 5th Edition for my grandson. His computer runs Vista. The program crashed on his computer and the screen looked like it had gone into a basic mode (everything was greatly enlarged). Then tried to load it on my Windows 7 with the same result. Next tried to see if it would operate on my old XP. The computer wouldn't even recognize the disk being in the drive. DON'T BUY THIS!!!

45155,0,"The cross stitch software program is o.k. and can be used well, depending on expectations. It is easy to navigate and to understand, and by far not as complicated as PCStitch. The software is enough for any moderate hobby-stitcher. It is sufficient to import pictures, but one has to tweak the pattern so it becomes more realistic and closer to the original picture. Simple pictures with clear lines and few colors convert very nicely to useable cross stitch patterns.For designing your own patterns, I would not recommend this product. In truth, the free KGChart does a much better job in this area.But overall the program is cheap for the options it offers."
48579,0,My 8 year old blew through this game in one day. This I was disappointed with because I couldn't find this game anywhere except online.. Although she is still very intersted in this game. Graphics are nothing exceptional. I don't feel it is a bad choice for girls. I think at best it is for 7 to 8 year olds.
7020,1,"I bough this CD-ROM 3-pack mainly for the Pooh and Mickey discs (the Rolie Polie Olie disk is not part of thiw review as I was unable to unstall it at the time of the review...an error with the disk, perhaps?). My daughter, who is 27 months old, LOVES both Pooh and Mickey and I thought this would be an excellent way to introduce her to the computer while using interactive methods to teach ABCs, 123s, and much more.First, the Mickey CD specifics:* learn letters with Mickey by playing hide-and-seek with six different letters at a time (Mickey says each letter)* learn numbers (1-10) with Pluto by instructing him to bark at the gophers who pop out of holes holding numbers (Mickey says each number)* learn shapes with Minnie by helping her find things that are of a certain shape. Shapes included are circle, square, triangle, diamond, and heart.* explore music concepts with Donald by dragging the mouse over different items in his backyard to make noises* there are coloring pages that you can print out which focus on the concepts addressed throughout the CD, and morePooh CD specifics:* learn opposites with Pooh as you drag the mouse over different thigns in his house* learn shapes, colors, letters, and numbers with all of Pooh's friends as you pop balloons containing these things* help build your memory with Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, and Roo as you try to remember what each character likes (they give you clues and you must guess accordingly)* explore music concepts with Christopher Robin and Pooh ans 4 of his friends by dragging your mouse over different instruments to make music as well as dragging your mouse over the characters to sing songs* explore different languages (French and Spanish) with Owl and Roo by helping Pooh choose items from behind a stage and hearing the word in both English and another language.* there are coloring pages and other printing options based upon the concepts addressed throughout the CDRolie Polie Olie CD (some details as shown on box):* help Olie clean his room and search for Spot* make music with Oilie in his kitchen* go scuba diving in Olie's tub* make ""Tellys"" out of household items* mix and match colors in Olie's roomI think this is a wonderful CD-rom set (without reference to the Olie CD, of course)! My daughter LOVES playing the different games on each CD-ROM and frequently asks for ""Mickey"" and ""Pooh"" games. she really likes to pop the balloons on the Pooh CD, and likes the shapes with Minnie on the Mickey CD. The best feature is that this game is truly made for young children who don't have the hand-eye coordination to fully operate a computer and mouse. The mouse activates functions on teh CD-ROM not by clicking, but by rolling over things (during play) and keeping the mouse on an item to change between tasks. There are special larger cursors throughout the game as well, so it's easier for littler ones to see what they are moving. And if they can't yet operate a mouse (my daughter just knows how to click the mouse, but hasn't figured out how to make it move yet), tehy can press keys on the keyboard and it will activate different parts in each ""game"".I wish I could have reviewed the Olie game, but I will definitely edit my review once I am able to install the Olie game (still haven't figured out why it isn't installing correctly - get an install error each time).I would definitely recommend this product, in particular if your toddler is already fond of the particular characters in teh game. My daughter was very familiar with (and in love with) Pooh and Mickey prior to purchasing this game, so it's possible that she enjoys it so much because many of her favorite cartoon characters are the ""stars"" of the game. But as a parent, I think this software is definitely an invaluable learning tool - the familiar characters are an added bonus."
74026,2,"Perhaps if you have a brand-new, very fast computer, this program would be OK but if you have a slower, older computer - forget about it. It runs on my two year old PC (XP-SP2) but not well enough to use. I am going to uninstall it and return to my old ULead Video Studio program."

74820,1,"I have finally connected my Yamaha PSR-225GM keyboard to my Toshiba XP laptop and now I am recording music directly from the keyboard into MIDI format. The software takes a while to get used to and there are some places where it might have been more user-friendly, but it is powerful and easy to use once you understand it. I like how you can select and move notes, change the length of the notes, change the musical instrument, and print out music. The music recording captured dynamics.Getting things to work took a lot of time. I spent a few hours and was about to give up. I am still not sure which of the things I tried made the recording to work. I ended up using the Edirol UM-1SX (purchased separately) instead of the USB MIDI cable that came with the studio kit. I configured the keyboard MIDI settings to channel 1 and made sure the MIDI would be sent out. I uninstalled and reinstalled the application. Then tried recording and voila it worked! Used EDIROL as MIDI input and Microsoft MIDI Mapper as MIDI output."

35790,1,"I found this program extremely basic and very helpful for creating quick imagery and physical representations of places and rooms that I have wnated to design.The detail in the accessories is good and the hands on experience of CAD drawing for the purpose of design is simple and easy. The instructions are a little confusing, but take it slow and it all works out.I think students will like this as a good introductory learning tool and those for those who just wanted to design without any formal education will find this easy to manuver around and create. It was fun too!Overall a very good basic, beginers program for CAD drawing and creations! 3-26-08"

I wish it had a way to make prints that were acceptable to our county building office for construction, but you can export/import .DWG and or .DXF files for a real CAD program.

I was able to load it on Virtual PC and then view the individual files (without the silly Windows front end, which was fine, but just not really needed) on my Mac, so I was not too unhappy. It has all the basic legal forms, but I suspect most people will only need two or three in their life (the problem is which ones), so it is nice to have them all on one disk. I wanted it for a simple Will and I am willing to read a book and make my own changes without a lot of help.

Microsoft just recalled it and we are not to let another copy out of these doors.&quot; I asked him about the recall and you would think I was asking for the alarm code for the store.

The games are up to date with fifth grade interest in some areas, offering virtual skateboarding and other treats to keep the mind tempted.

53706,1,"I checked the reviews on many types of dictation software before selecting Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 standard. I recently had my wrist operated on and knew that I would be unable to write utilizing my hand for quite a while. As an online student going to college I had to be able to participate in discussion boards and research papers daily. This software was unbelievably easy to learn. I followed the directions on setting it up so that the computer would recognize my voice. I spent approximately 5 hours learning to program, and practicing before I was operated on. I found that if I talked at my own natural speed the computer utilizing this software did an excellent job of deciphering my words. I found the instructions very simple to follow. Yes there were times that the computer displayed what I said incorrectly, but correcting it was extremely easy.I was able to keep up with my class throughout the six weeks I was in a cast. My arm is still in a brace and I'm still using the software on a daily basis. I'm actually using the software to write this review. I highly recommend this software to anyone that needs to write research papers or that does a lot of computer typing on a daily basis.I am such a strong believer in the software that I know I will continue to use it even when my brace comes off.I found the software very compatible and easy to use even to answer my e-mails quickly and efficiently.This might be the perfect software to get for any college student. To be able to look at research books and talk into the computer as you're looking up reference material is truly beneficial. It was also very easy to stop Dragon software when you needed to to take a break think what you needed to write next. All I needed to say was ""go to sleep"" and the microphone shuts off until you wake it out.To sum it all up the software was very easy to use and easy to set up. I recommend it highly.Boca Raton Florida"
31753,1,"I love Suse, I liberally evangelize it, and despite the trivial grouses of some reviewers (namely, Mozilla not being the default the browser or Gnome not being the default desktop, both of which are easily and freely resolved issues) I believe SuSE is the best Linux distro on the market, the benchmark to beat.But I'd like to point out that the ""Personal"" edition of the OS does all you probably need it to do. If you have a high-speed connection, the personal version is also absolutely FREE to download.Take a look at www.suse.com/us/private/products/suse_linux/pers/pers_prof.html (or google for ""SuSE 9.1 personal professional comparison"" in case this site filters the URL in my review) and you'll see why the Professional version is not worth the price of admission. It includes some micro-minor software that is easily skippable. (E.g., do you really need GnuCash and Mr.Project?)That said, if you're in the market for trying out a Linux, you simply cannot go wrong with SuSE; it is the most easily configurable, the best supported, the best documented, and above all, the most easily usable OS in the Linux world."

Inside it has an adjustable wall.I would not recommended it for a 15.6 computer. Maybe something smaller, but you would still need something for protection on the front and back. It fit exactly 15.6. and there is no padding. I had no need for the adjustable divider. The 15.6 Pro-Book used up all the space inside. It has something hard under the fabric of four sides, but the front and back doesn't seem to have any padding at all. It looks good and seemed to be a made well But when you add the price of the additional sleeve I purchased, maybe not the bargain I thought?I purchase a cheap sleeve to put the computer in and then into the tote. This made the case for protection almost $20 more and that was a cheap Sleeve.Added to the price of the tote, maybe not the deal I thought when I ordered it?Without the extra padding of the Computer Sleeve I would not recommend it for any type of travel, even across town."
39812,2,"I bought this review as an upgrade to 7.0. I have several thousand photos catalogged in 7.0The install was not clean. I keep my database on my network, and the instructions for install were unclear as to how to configure the install to go find the existing database. Next I managed to get into some infinite loop of ACDSEE quitting because it couldn't find the database- but there is no way to launch the program to change the location. Off to the help forums-which provided some help, but still took a lot of file searching to clean out the install. The uninstall feature does not clean up after itself.Finally get through all that, and try to rebuild my database adding image thumbnails. Got through about 2/3 of my pictures and consistently crashed. Watching the memory allocation, it appears to have some sort of memory leak- just keeps grabbing more and more memory. 7.0 did not do this.At that point I gave up, reinstalled 7.0 (again after having to manually clean up files from PRO).The good news is they gave me a refund without a lot of trouble.May try the upgrade again in a few months- if it looks like the version number has moved.

Sometimes it happens a lot, and sometimes it doesnt happen at all.A couple of months ago I went to the website to find some help about this and honestly wat they suggested didnt help much. My concerns were shared by many users too, as there were many negative comments there. I've just rechecked the same page just now, all the negative (yet true) comments have been deleted... Ouch!! Secrets out.So i guess, some who got lucky and dont get this problems are.... mmm lucky!!???All in all its a great item, but its also got its flaws. but on the good side, its CHEAP!! thats y i bought it hehe... on ebay :POh yeah the Guitar Port Online is cool!!... if u live in UK or the USA that is... coz the only way to cancel the subscription is to call the UK and the USA Line 6 offices, no online cancellation... And if you want to connect your Line 6 Pod XT to the same online subscription... you cant, you will have to make another subscription for your Pod XT, you cant use your Guitar Port account.But as i said, its cheap! and its got an array of very very very cool noises.3 stars for me"

The game seems limited at first, but when you finish the first time through, it asks if you want to play again and re-seeds the rooms with different things to find.

22261,1,"Nancy Drew games are the best. They're fun, they have nice puzzles, they have interesting characters/graphics/music, and they seem to be well thought out. I notice that many reviews for other games compare/contrast with Nancy Drew games, and with good reason--after more than a dozen games to draw from, Nancy Drew is swiftly becoming a ""bench test"" for other games. I also notice that many of the ND fans are in their thirties, like myself. Going through one of these games is something that a young girl can do but it's also something that we can do with members of our families--children, husbands, etc... It's wonderful how Nancy Drew has grown over the years, updating her phones as technology allows and such. Yet, she retains good, healthy habits. (If she opens a drawer to find something, then she *closes* it before walking away. She substitues healthy beverages for sodas with her meals.) There are always interesting things to learn in ND games. On the train in BMC, you can find information on semi-precious stones and, as in other ND games, there's a little piano playing as well. The ""ghost hunter"" is interesting, showing the little recording and pictures of ""Camille"" and giving Nancy an explanation of the dancing lights in terms of piezoelectricity. There's always so much to learn and investigate.This is definitely one of the best ND games yet."
40661,2,"I upgraded from Microsoft Money 2001 and couldn't be more frustrated with the 2006 version. I've had it for almost 2 months now and first of all, nothing about it is intuitive (I thought 2001 was pretty good) -- I still have to click around randomly on the various tabs and screens to find how to do just about anything except the most basic functions. I used to spend about 15 minutes 3x a week for all my financials; now I'm spending a couple of hours 4 or 5 days a week, mostly waiting for screens, fixing errors, or trying to figure out how to get something the way I want it.One of my most disappointing discoveries is that there is no longer a home inventory in 2006. I spent days creating my home inventory in MM 2001, complete with serial #s and descriptions, and I believe I attached pictures too. Now I'm not sure if or how I can retrieve all that valuable information.Microsoft Money 2006 is also unreliable and inconsistent. I had set up auto payments to be transferred weekly -- the transfers did go thru, but for 3 weeks in a row, it didn't recognize them when they downloaded automatically, then suddenly began recognizing them again as auto payments.I also don't like (okay, really hate) how MM ""recognizes"" your transactions and assumes categories, etc. It's usually wrong, and, last night as I edited these transactions (a real pain), the edits didn't stick. After I entered my edits, they transactions went back to the way they were originally downloaded and I had to re-edit.I also wish MM wouldn't match up downloaded transactions with ones that almost match but obviously don't, like $33.52 from Shell Oil and $34.45 from Walgreens. This is a real pain to resolve and was also my only complaint about 2001. I thought they would've fixed this for 2006.If I stay with MM 2006, I'll probably do away with the automatic downloads, and possibly the auto/electronic bill pay -- I can do that thru my bank's website easily enough and just enter manually into MM. I looked into Quicken because I used that years ago and liked it, but I'm not sure I wouldn't have the same issues there. I am seriously considering going back to the old ledger book after the frustrations I've had over the past couple of months! Unless you're not really serious about keeping your numbers straight and just want a program to play house with, DON'T BOTHER!!!"
48164,1,You are going on a field trip to the beach with the Magic School Bus Class. You look in the water and find a treasure map. You have to get the answers to the three questions in order to find the treasure. Along the way you can explore each zone of the ocean and play fun games that earn you fish cards. It is hard to get all the fish cards and I haven't even done it yet but I've started the second page. You can even print out your fish cards. Kids will have a lot of fun exploring the ocean and learning about sea life. You can also see animations by just clicking on a picture. This is a very easy game to use and I think you should buy it. If you don't you're missing out on something great.

But being the curious person I am, I decided to go down to my local music store and mess around with it. It took me years to learn how to use Cubase VST (I even had too buy a book at Amazon to help me learn it) with it's weird, confusing, non-user-friendly design. It took me minutes to learn Cubase SX. Cubase actually started a whole new program from scratch on this software and so you have a whole new, user-friendly, sequencing design that completely dwarfs the old retired Cubase VST. In conclusion, this program is easily Cubase's most amazing upgrade. If you want to hear endless hours of my music for free(Created using Cubase SX) just go to www.musicmartin.com/cdtwo"
25747,1,"I bought a copy of NIS 2003 about six months ago, and while I'm always apprehensive about loading new software, I found it very easy to install. I was able to configure it to stop all pop-ups, and it checks not only all incoming but also all outgoing mail for viruses. It automatically updates my virus definitions regularly, and within days caught a brand new virus that was making the rounds. It also automatically scans your hard drive regularly. In addition, it intercepts incoming &quot;intruders&quot; and will even show you (if you're interested) where in the world the rogue computer is located.So when we recently acquired a hand-me-down laptop, I got online and ordered another copy of NIS 2003. With rebates and discounts, I'd practically have to get it for free to beat the price. For the peace of mind alone, I'm happy to recommend this product."

57307,0,"I agree, this software is good. Great detail. The 3D feature is over-rated, though, for my uses. More of an image gimmick than actual representation of terrain. More importantly, though, my software suddenly &quot;lost&quot; one much-used quad sheet, leaving white space in it's place on my screen. I also lost all the markers and trails associated with that area, which included several day's work. Called their customer service for assistance and was connected to a very rude, arrogant, and unhelpful technician. Result: no fix. The company needs to back an excellent product with helpful and knowledgable technicians."
72993,1,"I purchased this Firefly remote a month ago to work with my PC-PVR (I have got a Hauppauge PVR-250 card and BeyondTV 3). As my computer and TV set are in different rooms, I thought it would be convenient to have an RF remote control so that I can still control video recording/playback while sitting in front of my TV. RF signals can usually travel a longer distance, and most importantly, they can penetrate walls.However, my first installation with the Firefly remote was not a totally success. It functioned well, but I have only measured a 6-foot of workable distance - with full battery power, and no blocking objects or interference sources nearby. I thought either I had a defective item, or the product was not as good as they said.I contacted Snapstream for support, and they suggested to try a different USB port or use a powered USB hub for plugging receiver. My computer has 6 USB ports - 4 in back and 2 in front, all built on the motherboard. I was using a front USB for the measurement. After I switched to an USB port in back, everything becomes perfect. I have learned that even all being built on the same motherboard, USB ports can be different, which may provide different power levels for external devices.Now my Firefly works great for my application, which is about 13 feet of transmission distance and with a wall (and some blocking objects as well) inbetween. Firefly remote can even perform the job of a mouse. Although it may not be as fast and convenient as a real mouse, it comes in handy for quick-and-easy controls. For the convenience the Firefly remote brings, I give it 5 stars!"

For example if any one of yourprogram which is in use crashes due to some internal orexternal error, you can easily END it without restartingyour enitre system. Not only that, you can also view allthe processes in use, not only the Programs(NOTE:Processeswere never shown in the previous Windows Versions).3. New Folders such as ""My Pictures"" and ""My Music"" allowing youto allocate your pictures aswell as MP3's in an organisedmanner. When you insert a CD-ROM, be it software, games, ormusic, Windows XP will automatically read it and decide whatits contents are and will open it up for you, without youhaving to do it manually.4. Built-in Programs such as ""Adaptec Easy CD Creator"", ""WindowsMedia Player"" and many more.5. Inludes ""Remote Assistance"" allowing other Windows XP usersaswell as yourself to use each others Desktops in helpingthem solve software problems.One Reason not to use Windows XP Home Edition:1. Requires a very high performance computer system. If youreally want to have the ultimate Windows XP experiencethen use a similar computer as I did; 1.7Ghz, 256Mb RamPressario with a 17 Inch Flat Screen Monitor!!"

ALso in some audio phyle's cases the voice mic use in a quality manner, is the ONLY purpose of this software, as microsoft's own media is of terrible quality. You need a mixer and quality mic recording software, the mixer needs to be user freindly(at least resonably so) and not go through uncessisary complicated steps to be utilize fully, the mixer and VO device are what make all this stuff work for the purpose of art and production of your own, and if sound software doesn't have these capablitiies, it's only an over priced karioke machine, and totally useless in my opinion!"

32869,1,"My Pentium 2 computer was running a bit slow and making strange noises so I figured it was time to upgrage the operating system. After looking around at Best Buy I found out that Microsoft's new windows Vista was coming out in January, but unfortunately my system didn't meet the basic requirements, as it only had 256mb of RAM. The helpful sales clerk said I could probably get by with Windows XP Pro, but that I couldn't upgrade from my current OS, so I would have to get the full version. They had some available for sale around $189.00 but none with Service Pack 2, which included some important security doo-dads and what-nots. So I searched online and found Amazon/Ritz Camera had this sweet baby with SP2 already included for only $5037.00! It was an extra $4848.00 dollars but it was worth it compared to the 20-30 minutes I would spend downloading and installing it with my dial-up internet connection. Now my computer runs slightly faster! I recommend this to anyone who just doesn't have the time to be bothered with those pesky downloads, and it sure beats the hassle of buying a new computer!"
12731,1,"This upgrade is absolutely worth the money. XP is far more stable than its predecessors, and boots up very quickly. One of its best features is the file and transfer wizard which makes upgrading to a new PC a snap. Another great feature is auto update which makes sure you've got all the patches and new versions as they are released."

18826,0,"If you're using Windows 2000 or Windows XP in a secure mode, to try and provide a second line of defense against viruses too new to be caught by your anti-virus software, Quicken 2002 will not make you very happy. It still is really a Windows 95 application, and gleefully writes all over the application directory (C:\Program Files\Quicken) every time it starts up.If you have user accounts on Windows 2000 that are ""Restricted User"" (in the Users group), the software will not run out-of-the-box. You will have to modify the security on the application directory to add Modify and Write permissions for the Users group. This, of course, means that any virus that gets into your computer can attack and infest any file that is part of Quicken.Having the application directory be writeable was not ""safe computing"" when Intuit wrote Quicken many years ago, and it is not ""safe computing"" now. Microsoft guidelines have you store all state under the user account in C:\Documents and Settings. It is telling that Quicken does NOT have any ""Windows logo"" certification from Microsoft. Maybe Quicken doesn't trust Microsoft not to show the new version to the Microsoft Money people, but Intuit also must know that it would flunk the certification process horribly! It is time to shame the application developers into making software that practices ""safe computing"", or we will be in virus hell forever.At least I could make Quicken 2002 run at all for a ""Restricted User"". Quicken 2001 tried to write to the Windows Registry every time it started, battling with Money over some file extension, there was no reasonable way to make that work. Quicken 2001 would only work on accounts with ""Power User"" priveleges, which I refuse to grant my everyday account for virus-protection reasons. (Yes, I know this is the default account protection on Windows 2000 and XP, but that's because the applications are all messed up.)Other than that, the program does seem to be well-behaved. I finally have something newer than Quicken 6 that runs on Windows 2000."

58732,1,"If you have Microsoft Train Simulator you probably know how driving the same locomotives (there are only 9) and the same rolling stock OVER and OVER again gets pretty boring. If you want to expand your roster of locomotives, rolling stock, and even objects along the route, Train Sim Modeler is a MUST! You can make almost ANYTHING and you have the power to do it! You can turn a dream into a reality with it. I recently created a Dallas Area Rapid Transit light rail car and it ran perfictly, BUT, after having TSM for about 2 years, that was my first locomotive I got to run PERFECTLY! Train Sim Modeler is neat, but you have to be prepared for a long time before you get your own custom-made train to work. If you are about ready to get this program for a child, say a kid in the 7-10 year old range, FORGET IT (unless you know how to work with CAD). TSM IS NOT for average kids, and they would probably be frustrated working with it for 2 minutes. I know I was, but once you figure everything out, you can make ANYTHING you want and it's a snap!I would recommend once you figure everyting out to make a few simple objects first, and then get into locomotives and cars.If you ARE thinking about getting this program for a child, once again, PLEASE DON'T QUITE YET. I would recommend just getting a few trains &amp; objects from other websites first, BUT, once you know how to work it PERFECTLY, and you can't find an object, locomotive or train car anywhere on any website, you can simply created it with Train Sim Modeler!"

15860,0,"I had always thought this software was costly and really overkill until I got my Pocket PC and wanted to get more out of it. I have used the Franklin Covey Day Planner and really enjoy how it has gotten me to prioritize my tasks and keep information at hand, and so finally caved and bought the software.Plan Plus must be used with Microsoft Outlook (not Outlook Express), so make sure you have that on your computer before getting started.First, several things I like about Plan Plus: it puts everything on one page-your calendar, a small monthly calendar where you can one-click to any day's schedule, a view of today's schedule, a look at your inbox/preview pane, and today's prioritized tasks. It's great. The prioritized tasks, for anbody not familiar with the Franklin Covey system, allows you to create new tasks (and have them recur), set due dates, and prioritize them (A=Must do, B=Normal priority, C=Not important) so that you can easily see what needs to be done. What most people don't always realize in life is that important tasks (i.e. long-term planning) are not always urgent, while some urgent tasks (email messages/ telephone) are not always important. I also enjoy being able to sync these tasks with my Pocket PC and take that wherever I go.Things about Plan Plus that I don't really use. I don't use Power Notes, which allow you to write directly on the note and scribble anything you want. To be honest, I have yet also to really utilize the goals and compass aspects of the software.I have never had Plan Plus make my computer crash, although my computer is relatively new (Pentium 4). It takes about five seconds to load, and another five seconds to call up all of my tasks. You decide whether that's too long for you.In short, I like Plan Plus, and I'm glad I bought it, but at the regular price of $80, I'm not sure it's exactly a steal. If you can find a used copy or a discount, however, I think it's worth it in productivity and functionality."

12095,1,"Originally I had purchased VS .NET and immediately realized I was forced to purchase 2000 or XP. Being that Microsoft always updates things instantly I got XP anyways. I heard it really wasn't that great, but now I realize those people are just negative. Windows XP is the greatest thing yet. I really like the way it looks and its faster than any Windows I've used. I have used Windows 95 and Windows 98 at home. Windows 95 [stunk]. Windows 98 was the most reliable. I thought Windows 2000 (which I used on campus) pretty much [stunk] too. Windows XP was great. However, if I was to complain I don't like the fact that its a resource hog. I would suggest you purchase a bit more ram for your computer before installing this. Otherwise it will suck the life out of your hard drive. Another bad thing is it really is still in beta mode, being that since I bought I have about 15 patches that have been automatically installed to update windows."

After a while, it gets annoying and the songs get old too. We had fun for a few days after Christmas but now the box sits unused. We will likely break it out from time to time. I bought it for my 7 year old who couldn't do it even on the 'easy' level. She didn't really like it. The adults had more fun. The 'hard' level is just ridiculously difficult. You'd have to practice for days on end to get it.Big positive is the uplifting lyrics in the songs."
53510,1,"I have used some version of Linux on my home computer for about two years now and I can honestly say that Linux, to include Linux Mandrake 7.1 has come a long way. Linux Mandrake 7.1 provides the user with one of the easiest installs and setups. Compared to Suse's YAST2 and Caldera's Lizard - Mandrake has configured a good setup tool.Linux Mandrake 7.1 also provides several good programs and applications that will help the new Linux user get accustomed to the world of Linux. New users who are coming from the Windows OSes will feel a bit easier using Linux Mandrake.On my machine I tired several different installs, using different cards. I swapped out my Voodoo Banshee card and threw in a generic 8MB video card - it found the card but there was a huge difference in the display quality of my installation process. I then re-installed it using two different sound cards, a Sound blaster Live! and a ESS Generic sound card - both were found but the ESS had more support and installed easier.Partitioning was the easiest it has ever been - gone are the days of having to learn the commands of FDISK or partionmagic. The partioning of the Linux Mandrake also makes it easy to install DOS/WIN partions.Although I liked Mandrake 7.1 and I would recommend it for novice users - I found that an install from Suse 7.0 was cleaner and provided me with the applications, especially the server applications and programs, that I use on a regular basis.Mandrake 7.1 is a good place to start. The price is amazingly reasonable and there is more support in publications for Red Hat compatible products -so it is a no brainer for newbie Linux users - go with Mandrake."
51389,0,"I convinced my daughter (age 7) to buy this game with her money in hopes that it would favorably compete with her current TV viewing schedule. The graphics and 3D aspects look great and the game seems interesting to play (for me). My daughter who loves educational software AND simple arcade type games finds this program boring. This is likely because of the ships transit time between events. For gamming fun, she prefers to bring up my copy of Half Life in multiplayer mode (without any other players) and explore/navigate around the environments."
7193,1,"My daughter really enjoyed this game, and did not run across the bug others have mentioned below.However - please note that she is a ""highly gifted"" 8 year old and a computer game wizard - and even so, she got stuck a couple of times and needed help. So I can see that for younger kids, this game might not be appropriate. But it is great for girls in that ""too old for toys, too young for boys"" stage, who are still young enough to love Barbie but don't need to add another doll to their collections.She played it for weeks (maybe a couple months) before she got to the end, but enjoyed it solidly every time she played. Once she got to the end, she went through it a few more times but has now put it aside.For us it was a nearly-perfect game, as she got a lot of hours of play out of it.My main problem with it is that the chores Erika has to do are so stereotypically female - sewing stuff, baking lots of cakes, and so forth. She has to be a kind of ""Stepford Barbie"" in order to be coronated. But whatever - my daughter enjoyed it, and that's what really matters."

36455,1,"It's difficult to be entirely objective reviewing something you've put so much time, effort, and pride into. Obviously I'll gush over Nicktoons regardless of content after working on the level design with Randy Angle and Ken Volmer. But it's something of a nice surprise when you discover that the game not only meets your expectations, but exceeds them. The bottom line is Nicktoons Racing: Winner's cup is fun, regardless of the fact that I worked on it. And with fun being such a rare and overlooked commodity in games today, it's thoroughly satisfying to be able to not only be proud of my work, but to look forward to others enjoying it as well.The graphics are colorful, fun, and fully representational of the cartoon world they depict. The particle effects are smooth, clean, and fun to watch. The streams of sparks after picking up the nitro, the wrenches and gears they fly when you hit the road obstacles, and the goo splattered all across the screen when you run over the goop are perfect. Ditto for the character specific power ups, with the exception of several of the sprite based ones, which come off as too simple and under drawn comparatively. The buildings look great, and are perfectly suited to their respective environments. It would've been nice to see everything fully rendered and in 3-D, but it doesn't detract much from the overall experience. Nice animations, although the character's heads sometimes obstruct their limbs.The game play is shockingly entertaining. There's no greater thrill than zooming ahead of the pack to reach your checkpoint, only to turn around and crash head-on into Sponge bob and the gang on your way to the next one. The shear entertainment value of being turned into a llama during the ""Musical Chairs"" mini game warrants a purchase of the game on its own. The rest of mini-games are passable, but without a multiplayer mode, they're good for a quick look and not much else. But the quick race feature provides hours of game play, especially given the fact that the checkpoints are randomized for every new race (whereas in the Winner's Cup they always appear in the same places).The controls are sufficient. None of the cars feel too floaty, with the exception of Dr. Crocker's Segueway, which feels much stiffer and more awkward than it should. A greater difference in the cars' stats would've been nice, perhaps with a physical chart of each car's strengths and weaknesses (acceleration, top speed, handling, etc.). My biggest problem with the cars is that they're a little too slow, especially on easy mode.The levels are creative, lively, and much larger than you would think at first glance. The ramps are especially fun, and add to the cartoonish atmosphere. More hidden areas, combined with more animation would've been a boon, making the areas thoroughly engrossing and entertaining on every pass. Also, despite their replay value, the fact that there's only four tracks hurts. Eight tracks would have been more than enough, and likely would've quadrupled the replay value to boot.The biggest gripe I have with Nicktoons Racing: Winner's Cup is that it feels like a Value title. Four tracks, no plot, no cinematics, only a few hidden extras. That's not to disparage the game play or the graphics; this is one of the best Value titles I've played in ages. It's fun, engrossing, and thoroughly worth the $20.00 you'd spend on it. But it's a good game, not the great game it would have been with a slightly larger budget and a few more moths of work behind it.Any K-5th grader who does not like this game probably did not like video games at all in the first place. You can practically see the kindergartener's eyes go wide and fill with light and enthusiasm as Sponge Bob declares ""I'm ready, I'm ready!"" at the starting gate, before speeding off in a haze of bubbles and nitro blasts. There's nothing not fun about it, and in the end, beyond the minor gripes, that's all that matters."

I've been looking for a way to capture and display these, so I can tell our family's story. 3D-Album and a document reader are the best solution by far.The 3D Album has given me a huge variety of themes to display the different stages of our lives.

I have wanted to do this project for years, and now I'm having the best time putting these albums together.I would recommend this product to anyone. It's my favorite software product."
33309,1,"This is the first cakewalk sequencer I have purchased since the one bundled with Sound Blaster AWE32 soundcards, which was very basic. (Sorry can't recall the name) It is very good value compared to the competition, ie Acid or Ableton Live, but is less intuitive in terms of the user interface in my opinion, which tends to be a bit cluttered in some ways.Plasma is essentially a midi sequencer (in the feature packed tradition of cakewalk products) with the ability to record audio straight to disk, and to sequnce that Audio in the form of Loops much like Acid from Sonic Foundry. Unlike Acid to use a loop more than one time in a track you cannot simply draw the loop with the cursor. You have to actually load it in again from the loop preview window, or copy and paste from the last occurence of the loop. This is somewhat annoying when you are in a hurry to complete a mix of reasonable length, and is not near as intuitive as Acid's loop drawing feature. As usual midi sequencing is very good , with plenty of different and usefull quantize and midi editing features, as many have come to expect from cakewalk.A great strength of plasma is it's bundled effects module known as FXPAD , it is quite usefull for getting a quick idea of the type of effect you are after, though (to my ears) it is somewhat lacking in sound quality compared to stand-alone third party Directx plugins.Another great feature is the bundled loops, which are on the same install CD as the software itself in the form of .wav files. They are mostly usefull loops, though some of them are a bit cheesy sounding, also only some are marked with actual speed in BPM in the filename, which causes headaches if you are in a hurry. There could also be more hi-hat patterns and lead-ins in the percussion section.What I like the most about plasma is actually the sound engine itself. It is very LOW LATENCY in terms of the time for a sound to enter the soundcard , be processed, and be output. This makes it great for use with realtime effects and softsynths. (Be aware though that it only supports DirectX plugins, no VST).It achieves it's low latency performance, by bypassing the microsoft API known as KMixer which is responsible for latency issues for realtime audio processing under windows. Kmixer can cause latency to be minimum 30ms (+ that of your particular soundcards drivers) which is terrible for live recording/performance. I got 20ms latency on a duron 800 (KT-133A chipset), using the built in AC-97 Codec and the latest drivers from VIA !Even better realtime performance (less than 10Ms !) is available using a run of the mill soundblaster Live card plus driver from the Russian Kx-Project. (I cannot recommend enough for SB owners to switch to these awesome replacement drivers , which by the way are free, and about 3MB in size compared to Creative's 20MB garbage) Try doing a search in google for this.It is very good in my opinion to have such good realtime DSP performance (Thanks to the well optimized SONAR Engine) without having to shell out for a Pro-Spec soundcard such as those based on the Envy-24 chipset. They are great cards but are not cheap.Cakewalk Plasma is basically Sonar minus a few features. The feature that I personally regret not having is the ability to use more than one soundcard at a time. There are more differences that I don't have the time to cover here. Cakewalk are quite helplfull answering questions (I have found) so write to them to clarify the differences if you are seriously considering buying this product.I am currently mixing together a rap demo-CD for a friend from the pre-made loops plus his freestyle rapping. Overall it has been a hassle free experience so far... :)All in All - Cakewalk Plasma is A good Value Product , with plenty of Bang-for-Buck. I hope this review has been usefull to you. Best of Luck ~ Cameron"

56478,1,"I've been on the look-out for educational games for my son. He loves playing on the computer, and we're both happy when he can pick a game that challenges him mentally as well as being fun. This game has been his first pick since I bought it. It is a bit of an older game, but it's perfect for kids. It has habitat exploration, basic math, animal facts and cute little songs. In each habitat (savannah, ocean, etc) there are different games to play, and once you finish a task you can earn a picture or stamp of a particular animal to learn more about it.I would highly recommend this game for the 5-7 age group. It might be a bit challenging to navigate through for a 4-year old unless they're pretty good with a computer already, and it might be a bit too immature for kids 10 and older. It has enough games to keep them entertained and learning for a while. My son sings the regeneration rock song from the crab game at least three times a day. I love having him explain to me what a nocturnal animal is, what an herbivore would eat and what happens to a crab that loses a claw! Two thumbs up from us."

Barrons mastering Spanish would be the best study(its boring but effective)"

46859,1,"I have been very pleased so far with this software. I also purchased the Art Text. They are fairly easy to understand and have a lot of features to offer the user, for a reasonable fee.I would recommend this product. You can download a free trial version on the Belight websight."
69345,1,"Money 2007 is a great overall personal finance product. I've been using it exclusively for many years and am very satisfied with my choice (over Quicken).Some key points:- If you have a previous version and are experiencing slow performance, this version is much improved.- The Lifetime Planner is a great tool. I have used it to lay out my long term plan, which helps me make better decisions in the short term. In my research, I've read that the Money feature is much more robust and valuable than the Quicken version. I'd recommend researching this feature on a product description page (Amazon or Microsoft) for more info.- Budgeting and reporting tools are solid. Not much left to want here.Overall a great product. The performance increase was worth the upgrade and the Lifetime Planner feature is the deal-breaker for me personally in terms of choosing between this product and Quicken."
37064,0,"I bought this software for my Garmin Etrex Vista HCx GPS mainly for use while kayaking in Minnesota and Wisconsin. After checking the maps of lakes that are among the more fully detailed, however, I find them not up to par for my mapping needs, and I don't have the option of using another company's map program with my Garmin GPS since the format is proprietary.I knew ahead of time that only about 8% of Minnesota's 15,000 lakes were represented, and not all 1200 lakes included in the software were shown in great detail. I wasn't happy about that, but at least I knew about it up front.The most glaring omissions in Inland Lakes is where the map fails to show connections between some lakes in a chain, such as where Lake Calhoun connects with Lake of the Isles via canal in Minneapolis, rivers that connect to lakes but not on the map, such as where the Sauk River connects to Kraus Lake near Cold Spring MN, and rivers that are missing sections on the map where in reality they are contiguous, like the Sauk River again, between Cold Spring and the Mississippi River. If you are exploring inland lakes and rivers with these maps in your GPS, you would likely also need other maps that fill in the gaps in the electronic map. To me, if Garmin is going to charge as much as they do for a map, the lakes and rivers they include should at least be accurate. If I get in trouble in the wilderness while kayaking, an accurate map is a must. At the very least it is expected. Paper maps have less errors.Because of these issues I am thinking of buying a Delorme PN-40 GPS which comes STANDARD with Topo USA including topographic, lake and street maps, and comes with a $100 credit toward their USGS Quad maps, aerial and satellite maps for about the same cost as my Garmin Vista HCx and one set of flawed optional maps. That way if one map isn't 100% accurate, I can check another one to fill in the blanks, and I'm quite sure that between Delorme's standard topographic and lake maps, I'll be able to find more than 1200 lakes in Minnesota. I'll have an even better chance of finding those hidden lakes with USGS Quad, aerial and satellite maps at my fingertips.So in summation, I've found Garmin's Inland Lakes maps to be useful, but it's not as precise as I need it to be. That's too bad, because I like my Garmin Vista HCx GPS. Yet if I'd known about the flaws I found ahead of time, I never would have bought the maps or the GPS from Garmin. I'm still using the two for now, but I'll be checking Google Maps or Google Earth first, before I leave on a trip."

85896,1,"If you're looking to create the next Doom 3 or Half-Life 2, then I can't really recommend this program. If you want to make an advanced FPS game, or a simple pong game, then I can recommend Dark Basic. In fact, Dark Basic Professional is probably capable of creating any kind of game that you can come up with. The catch? You have to program it yourself, all from scratch. Dark Basic makes manipulating 3D data extremely easy, but it's not a game creation package which lets you click and create. If you are determined enough, it's easy to learn all of Dark Basic's commands, as half of programming a game is in the logic. Dark Basic will hardly limit you, and will give you capabilities that were probably impossibly hard for you to use in C++. The end result of creating a game from scratch results in a tremendous sense of satisfaction, especially when you share it with friends and family. Although previous versions of Dark Basic Professional had some hardly crippling bugs, most of them have been eliminated, and with the release of upgrade 6.0, DBPro is a very stable development engine. Overall, I totally recommend this to anyone who wants to create a game, but is determined enough to learn how."

89925,0,"It took a couple of weeks before I was able to use this product due to a strange design flaw (bug? feature?). If you load it on a Windows machine that does not have a ""C:\"" drive it will report ""system contains low memory"" and not run. This little feature is not covered in the manual or revealed by tech support. Fortunately, I found the answer in a newsgroup. I have reported it to Corel (Procreate) and hope they will at least note it on future manuals (or fix it). I named one of my drives ""C"" and loaded it there.Now that it runs I find it does an excellent job on fuzzy edged things if you select and tweak and tweak, but for most product work the Photoshop pen tool works faster. I will keep it and use it occasionally. It would be good for manipulated portrait work."

The story of Anne's family in hiding is one that frightens and intrigues everyone who reads it. Visiting the actual house makes it all seem so very real and close to home. The next best thing to actually going there is to tour the house with this great new software. We bought this so that our kids could relive the experience back at home but I could also see it used as a wonderful teaching tool in the classroom. We all love playing with it. The software can't replace the diary itself for story, but it does add another dimension that is fun and educational. If you love the story, don't miss it!"

62153,2,"I bought these thinking they would be as cool as I remembered. They weren't, in fact the software is outdated, and I had a hard time installing them on my newer PCs. The game play was frustrating and not easy to manipulate. Basically technology has changed so much that your initial instinct on how to play the game is not usually correct. We had to learn by trial and error, mostly error. It was overall not a fun and rewarding experience, forget about educational. We spent more time trying to figure out how to play the game than we did learning anything."

I was running Microsoft Windows 95, then Microsoft Windows 98 then finally Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition. I was going to upgrade to Microsoft Windows Me!, but when I heard it was still using the Microsoft Windows 98 engine, I said enough! I upgraded to Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional and it was the best move I made. It has all the plug and play of Microsoft Windows 98 but it's built on NT technology. I couldn't upgrade to Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 because I have a scanner plugged into a USB port but Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional took care of all of that. I have a four year old Gateway Pentium Pro 200 machine and it's now running faster than my work laptop which is Pentium III 366MHz. Did I mention that my laptop is running Microsoft Windows 95? I will be upgrading that one very soon too! One word of caution though, MAKE SURE you check out the hardware and software compatibility list, especially the hardware one. My sound card, an Ensoniq Vivo, was not supported but I was able to use the legacy NT 4.0 driver. It took a while before I got is working, but it was worth it. Even if you are a home user, don't bother with the other ones. I used to have to reboot my machine two or three times a night in a four hour span. So far, I haven't frozen yet in over a week. The only time I have to reboot is when I occassionally add new features or software. My vote is, way to go Microsoft! What took so long to put the plug and play and NT technology together? Thanks for your time all."

85154,0,"Dogz is, without a doubt, one of the neatest computer games ever made. I was very excited with the release of Dogz 5, though I was slightly disappointed when I got the game.The mini games are okay, but at first confusing. Also, you have to WIN your toys. I have played one of the easiest mini game, a game where you basically swung you're Dogz around to kill the scarabs, and have gotten the same toy over and over and over (and so on). Very rarely do I ever get a new toy. Some important items come with the carrying case (also, you now have your toys in the carrying case, which I think is quite handy. The worst mini game is the Tic-Tac-Toe one. Its very hard to get you're Dogz to land exactly where you want it to. I have to place my Dogz one space below where I want the mark to be.The Dogz breeds are cool, except for the German shepherd. It, with all due respect to the makers of Petz, looks like someone squeezed its muzzle, enlarging its head. It has a huge head. And it looks like it is angry, because of its ""eyebrows"". The Papillion is cute, but is very hard to train. They jump at the treat, beg, and will not do the trick! I have tried to get my Papillion (on Dogz) to sit for thirty minutes, and I got nowhere.The pet scenes are cool. The bath in the salon [was bad] though. Its the same as putting your Dogz on a chair, it doesn't clean they or anything. The Asian Temple was the worst of the play scenes, mostly because it's basically just a room with a big monkey in it. The monkey is for a mini game, but that's about it.I hope this review helps!"
77887,0,"I've been designing with DW for a while now. The 2004 upgrade remains essentially the same, except for a few changes:[1] The default is now CSS. If you want a tables based layout, you can still work with it but a change needs to be made in the preferences.[2] The previous Dreamweaver MX supported CSS-P to a degree but editing it wasn't always easy. MM were obviously aware of Dreamweaver's rendering problems and for the new version, have borrowed upon Opera's rendering engine to do some of the hard work and it's now several magnitudes better.[3] Secure FTP built in[4] Microsoft Word and Excel copy and paste. Earlier version would lose the formatting when text was pasted inside DW. In this sense, DW now equals Frontpage[5] On-the-fly cross-browser compatibility checking[6] Some simple image editing like cropping and tonal adjustments without leaving the programAll this is fine and dandy, some of these features are also a god-send, but the CSS handling is a bit quirky yet. Surely, there must be a simpler and more intuitive way to do all this? There's far too much jumping around the interface required. Instead of providing one really inspired WYSIWYG way to do things, it seems to offer a multiplicity of mediocre alternatives, almost as if the programmers couldn't make their minds up and say, 'Hell, we'll put it all in'. That is a recipe for camels, not thoroughbred racehorses.If you know your way around Dreamweaver already, you might welcome the new CSS editing facilities but 50% of the full price for an upgrade seems grossly excessive. I'm a bit disappointed that after all this time, Macromedia have produced something that is okay, but not great.Besides, in the rush for an upgrade (now that GoLive is getting its own feet too) MM seems to have settled for some degree of bloat. My DW updated to 2004 MX is even more of a RAM hog than before.Net net: I'd wait for the next version upgrade, by when hopefully MM would have tied in all these loose ends."
79215,1,I bought one for myself and find that it is VERY useful when in unfamiliar territory. I would have had great difficulty finding a business that was tucked away behind other buildings and trees if I didn't have this to help me zero in on the location. As I got closer I kept asking for the distance to the destination. When the distance started getting greater I new I had passed my destination. Being able to use voice commands to get information and for it to respond with voice makes it much safer than trying to read a Thomas Guide while on the road. My Father was impressed so now I'm getting him one for Christmas.
87039,1,"This is one of my favorite games on my computer. Basically- you are able to do a lot of things with your babyz. People write fan sites that allow you to get more stuff for your babyz created by the fans and chat with other fans. You are able to dress your babyz, feed your babyz, change their diapers, feed them, give them toys, play with them, bring them outside, ect. and you can watch them grow from shuffling their belly across the ground, to crawling on their fours, to standing and walking! This is an awesome game that I recommend to everything who enjoys animals or young children. It gives you a chance to have your own!"
73202,1,"I'll keep this short because I'm supposed to be writing! I used to use Final Draft for all my TV work (Wire In The Blood, Hornblower). I even recommended it to the BBC when they still used Word for screenplays. Then a friend and producer showed me Screenwriter and I have never looked back. It's far more intuitive than FD in so many ways, it makes it easier to just concentrate on the text. And technically Screenwriter is far more solid - I have never used a version of Final Draft that didn't have numerous really irritating bugs, which tech support could never seem to resolve despite endless patches. I haven't patched Screenwriter for years quite simply because I don't need to - it just works. I'm sorry I ever backed FD now, but it's almost the standard program in the UK. I often write my stuff in Screenwriter and import it into FD for submission.Note that FD tech support costs money whereas Screenwriter's doesn't. How can the smaller company afford to provide free tech support? I suspect the answer is simple: that hardly anyone ever needs it. And to the reviewer who complained about the CUT TO's clogging up his script: you can switch all that stuff off you know!"

88844,1,"Being a child of the 80's, and that doesn't mean I was born in that time it means I GREW UP in it (born 1973), meaning I was conscience of what was going on around me, and old enough to retain all the cultural stimulus it had to offer in TV, Music, Movies and Trends. One of the most memorable events was watching V, from its first miniseries, to the final battle to the short lived series I was a serious fan. From then until now I list it in my top 10 favorite TV shows of all time. My sister and I would play V, I would always be the Star child, and she would be Diana, and I once even had a cat with a skin problem who I named Diana because it was a bit scaly.The Miniseries and The Final battle were excellent pieces of TV, although they are admittedly cheesy at times, and to our eyes now they seem so B-movie under budget effects, those shows still work for us just as much as they did back then. The Series that followed unfortunately contained little of the excitement and originality that the others do.There are many problems in this series, too many to ignore.1) They show the same footage over and over again, as if we cannot recognize that they have used it before. The flying of the skyfighters over the city or country shooting at each other was from the other series, and so was Mike on horseback, they also showed the same footage of the visitors checking out the same van twice on two different episodes. The inside shots of the Mothership, as well as the shuttles going in or out is all recycled and quite frankly it ruins the momentum of the show.2) The visitors eating habits, okay they eat meat, they are here to eat us right? But every Visitor party on the mother ship was a buffet of parakeets, mice, and spiders where was the human steaks? We get that they like mice, yet they had to show the same Gag over and over again ""mouse being lifted up, shoot away, mouse in mouth, omg they are eating mice"" whatever. In one shot, they show a bowl of worms and the one on top is a freaking gummi worm for the actor to eat. Yes it's that obvious.3) In Nathan Bates Office he has a ""plasma ball"" the kind you buy at Spencer's in the mall, its plainly displayed as if to say ""look I am high tech"" Later, the ball shows up on the Mother Ship and it is used as a communication device to speak to the leader, they even use Star Trek sound effects for it. No lie. Along those same lines, Nathan Bates office doubles as a ""computer lab"" in one episode.4) A microphone is clear as day when Elizabeth, Phillip, Willie, Mike and Julie are trying to get through a door on the last episode, right before the black light effect it's in the upper left hand corner. Also when there is an explosion on the mother ship behind a door, you can see someone spraying smoke up and down to create the effect.5) Mike Donovan has countless ""unnecessary"" stunts like: running then rolling on the ground, jumping on top of cars and sliding, rolling than shooting. At one point in the end him and Julie and Kyle and Willie are running from Lt. James, the rest of them are behind a parked car, Mike runs towards them.....and jumps on the hood sliding into place, the shot pans out and there is no apparent reasoning for him to have just done that, you really want Kyle to say ""okay Donovan that was completely unnecessary""6) The resistance has serious problems killing the visitors in close combat, yet they killed thousands with the Red Dust7) The Reverb effect for the visitors voice is gone entirely, that was an important part of the original series, it set them apart from us, was it just too expensive?8) The ""regulars"" drop like flies. Elias, Robin, even Julie and Ham went on hiatus for many episodes. We get Lydia, and Kyle, and Nathan, and Elizabeth in their place and its just not the same. Ham isn't even in the final, which sucked. It seemed to me that they took these amazing characters and just discarded them like trash.9) Donovan has a kid, Shawn; he was an awesome character in the original series and in the final battle. He gets converted by Diana and suddenly is this arrogant little visitor lover who apparently we as an audience aren't supposed to care about. Donovan didn't, he didn't even attempt to rescue him after the initial episode with Shawn betraying him. Diana didn't use Shawn to her advantage either. Mike doesn't even ask Phillip to Get Shawn out of there! And in the End when they all go to the mother ship, Mike never even looks for his own son!! Maybe it was his tight jeans; they cut off all the circulation to his brain.10) Elizabeth was a great idea, poorly executed and misused. The Star Child, who had all these powers and was so important, becomes this Fairy pink sexpot in the end and we don't even get to see the freaking leader? Huge Letdown.Even with the countless mistakes, and there are a TON more, I still love this series. Why? Because it's V. Because it's comforting, and familiar and its part of my childhood (back then I didn't notice its faux pas) I heard they are making a new one, supposed to come out this year and Mike, Julie, and Diana's characters are signed on to come back so far. I hope so, it would be nice to get some closure."

57286,1,"I bought my Garmin E Trex Vista on the recommendation of the salesman, telling me that I can &quot;hook it up to my computer, and download maps&quot;. Even the manual that came with the GPS gave a quick blurb about adding their MapSource software to add &quot;detailed map data&quot; to the very limited map that's built-into the unit. So I investigated both the Topo maps, and Recreational maps at the Garmin website, and both seemed quite a bit more detailed, even though my favorite lake looked only like a rough representation, with only one hill. Then I checked out Map Tech, and the detail was ten-fold! It showed every little slope, and accurately depicted every inch of the shoreline, so I bought it. The only glitch I noticed, was that the cursor on the map is supposed to show elevation, but if you follow one line thats supposedly following a contour, it's plus or minus 15 feet as you scroll, and when I pointed at the lake, then at a thirty foot hill, it showed the same elevation between the two, where the field right next to it accurately showed every foot difference of elevation But when I tried downloading the maps into my Garmin Vista, I found the only thing you can transfer back and forth between the GPS and computer were waypoints, tracks, and routes. So all I could download were little dots on that screen, which shows my lake as a blank field. Garmin Website tells me the only GPS units that accept map upgrades, (Mapsource only), are the GPS12 Map, GPS III+, E-Map, GPS Map 295, and the Street Pilot. I guess all I can do with the MapTech is print the maps to carry to the field, lug my lap-top with me on a hike, or buy a handheld, but someone else wrote that his Compaq works,but not Palm? All I wanted was a small GPS, which I could take on a hike, and have it show me very detailed maps, so I could find the best routes, and I'd never have to worry about getting lost. This one only shows main roads, how to get back to your starting point, and little lines to follow if I pre determine a route at home."

23023,0,"I have to agree with the other reviewers... there's not enough space to enter all of the information about a charity, the tables are limited and not searchable (though categorically organized), and the error messages I've received so far (""The charity name was over 37 characters"" yeah, so? you want them shorter or something?; ""An Error Occurred While Updating. Please check that you have an Internet connection and administrator rights. Please try updating later."") don't really explain how to resolve the problem....but what I do like is that it lets me enter all of the donations I've been collecting all year long and I can start getting them entered before I've received my W-2s and 1099's. Gives me a head start while I'm waiting for tax forms. Plus the most common items are already in there and have estimated values. I do think Intuit's equivalent software has a better way of evaluating the value of items, and will reward you better for your donations in the tax return. ...but then I would have to use TurboTax which I was unhappy with for TY2006 and TY2005.This software is fine as a free TaxCut feature, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it."

Also most of the roads in my neck of the woods have numbers on the signs designating what you're driving on. City Navigator uses names for the most part. Since they like named roads so much you'd think that one could use their ""FIND"" function to look up a famous road. Well, you'd be wrong. Try the Blue Ridge Pkw. or the Great River Road and see what happens. What City Navigator does it does fairly well, it just doesn't do nearly enough.I waited until most pundits seemed in agreement that GPS was a well established product and then bought the ""best"" map for my hardware.

41591,1,"Initially I was angry as the box I got said Windows 95 and did not say windows XP like I saw next to the image on amazon. I sent an email to the seller requesting a refund and informing him that the package had not been opened. Haven't heard back from the seller, but in all fairness it's the weekend (has only been two days). Well I started googling seeing if I could get this 95 software to run on my Windows Xp or Windows 7 (I have both ). I found information on running the program on Windows compatibility mode and that this would help run older software. Well I decided to take a chance and opened the box. I put it into my window 7 computer and to my surprise it ran!! I didn't even go into compatibility mode (maybe the computer did on it's own/automatically). Now it seems from our early experiments that you always have to put the disk into the computer for it to run (but who cares). My husband is still seeing if he can get it to save on the computer and place the icon on the desktop--last I checked he hasn't been able to. If he figures it out I'll write back. My 7 year old son is ecstatic! I love my husband!I tried another disk called ""Real World Spanish"" which is also from 1995. It ran also. I wonder why? If you know why please make a comment below explaining this as I would like to know. The package for StoryBook Weaver Deluxe says: system requirements: To run on Windows and Windows 95 computers, you need: 486 or faster processor, Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher, or Windows 95, 256-color display, 8MB RAM, 16 MB RAM recommended, double speed CD-ROM drive."
17774,1,"I haven't been using the product for that long, but it certainly has all the bells-and-whistles, and they all work. It is picky about the modem it needs (requiring a modem that properly supports voice), but once running it is very slick! Answers my phone, allows me to do voice mail blasts etc. etc.I would definitely recommend anyone try the 30 day trial. They have a newer product that allows remote access to your email, contacts, files and such (according to tech support anyway), but the remote access appears to be the only difference from this product ... and if it ain't broke!"
84420,1,"All of my kids loved this game. Nothing bad to say about it. It gives soccer lovers a chance to pick teams, coach, learn the rules and have a lot of fun. League or single play option give players a chance to accumulate stats and even progress to the playoffs. Good graphics and lots of audio commentary add to the fun of this game."

I LOVE WMM2 & have found that VERY easy to navigate, but it doesnt have nearly the amt of cool effects as this does! If someone could help me out, I'd appreciate it!I would love to continue making more BTVS videos, & hopefully get my $$'s worth out of this software!"
58036,1,"The game wasn't that ""creepy."" However the toil without oil thing was quite interesting. The voices were annoying; they should hire REAL Brits to record the voices for the characters. The puzzles were really hard and you have to use a hint website for them, as was the gargoyle touching thing. However, it seems Jane acted a lot younger than her supposed age in the game. The things she did were more like a five-year-old's actions. Otherwise it was an intriguing game and fun to play."
39493,1,Great! This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come. I like it.
6910,1,"GIT is doing a great job with these Marvel Comics collections. I bought the Spider-man collection a little over a year ago. Closely followed by X-Men and Fantastic Four. In the past couple weeks I picked up The Incredible Hulk, Captain America and Avengers compilations. I'm looking forward to the Iron Man disk coming out soon. My only regret is that after I bought the FF collection they came out with a second set with more issues plus the Silver Surfer runs (I'm sure to coincide with the movie).A few reviewers of these disks have complained that the images are just scans of original comics. All I can say is get over it. You are getting thousands of dollars worth of books for $40 or less. You couldn't have even bought the first 25 issues of the most recent run on Captain America (which finish the Captain america disk) for that. If Marvel was going to re-color and computerize their entire libraries to put on disks, I can guarantee you that they would not sell 40 years worth of a series for $40. They would probably charge that for every 3-5 years worth of the series. I think it's great that you can see these old comics along with the old ads. I'm a kid of the eighties so seeing ads for some of the old computer games is really cool. Yes, a few pages have some smudges on them, but whose comics don't - it just adds to the new age feel of cracking open your old comics that have been boxed/bagged for years.Pros:1) years of comics for pennies an issue2) simple category menus: decade - year - issuesCons:1) If you don't have at least a 17"" monitor you will likely have to scroll around the page to have it large enough to read2) might have to wait another 40 years for the next compilationWish List:1) X-Men Family = compile New Mutants, X-Force, X-Factor, X-Men & Generation X on a disk2) Marvel Minis = Secret Wars 1 & 2, Infinity Gaultlet/War/Crusade + tie in issues, Age of Apocalypse, Civil War, Annihilation, etc...3) Showcase = Marvel Comics Presents, Marvel Fanfare, Marvel Team-Up etc..."
89094,1,"I am running Parallels on a recently-purchased MacBook Intel Core Duo with 2 GB of RAM. The advent of Parallels was one of the main reasons I bought a Mac. I needed a new laptop, but I can't leave the Windows world just yet, so the ability to run alternate OSs in a VM was critical for me.Parallels installs easily and plays well with the Mac OS. You do need to read the manual -- VM software is not your everyday productivity tool -- but it works well. I have installed Windows XP and two flavors of Linux on my Mac and Parallels has handled them well. All of my MVs have been able to take advantage of the Mac's network card and other hardware without issue. I had a caps-lock problem with the Mepis distro of Linux, but other than that Parallels has performed like a dream -- just maske sure to feed it lots of memory (I recommend 1GB at a minimum). At less than $80 retail, I can't see why you would go with anything else."
35052,1,"I see a lot of bad reviews for Poser 6 but that didn't stop me from buying it. It seems to me that everyone is hung up on the fact that it's hard to use or doesn't compare to their idolized ideals of what they were hoping for. Of course Poser is hard! You don't paint your first painting and expect it to come out like a Picasso do you? You don't buy a skateboard and expect to skate like Tony Hawk as soon as you get it home right? So why expect to be able to fully comprehend a new piecse of sophisitcated software in just a few quick clicks. No matter what you do you have to learn (and I'd like to stress the word LEARN) all the basics and then move on to the tricks of the trade. I love Poser 6 it's not that hard to use if you take some time and work through some tutorials and read some hints from the online community. I also baought the book Poser 6 Revealed: The official guide and that helped as well. I bought Poser 6 about 5 months ago and work with it maybe 2 hours a week. All in all I've put in about one full-time work week over the past 5 months and I've gotten to the point where I'm able to create some decent beginners work. I started with no knowledge of digital art at all and now have a good basic understanding. If I can do it so can you. If you want to create digital art look at the other programs of similar type, most cost well over the price you pay for poser and have their own problems and user interfaces that you will spend about as much time learning as you will with Poser."
81291,1,"I don't know what Chris was talking about, it sounds like he was predecided to not like it, and probably didn't give it enough time to learn 123. I've been using Smartsuite since '98. The company I worked for had a guy custom build a comprehensive MIS system in Approach, and I got to learn Approach along while he was building it. It was used for everything from estimating to invoicing to labor tracking. I suppose the same type of system could be done in MS Access, but I've tried working with Access, and it doesn't compare to the ease of using Approach. Lotus 123 is basically the same as Excel, except for few of the command keys, and a couple of other things. I grew to like 123 better than Excel, probably just because I got used to it. I will admit that Lotus WordPro is a bit confusing, so I'd give the preference to MS Word, but I don't use word processing much. As for the other things like the web building stuff, I haven't tried it much.Overall, especially considering the price difference between the Lotus and Microsoft packages, I'd prefer Lotus."
33011,0,"Hello, I am Russian Blue Witch. This product tells of how the CLuefinder end up on another planet, have to stop a wicked person named Malicia, and learn about reading on the way. This was my first CLuefinders game, and it was lucky I loved the plot or else I wouldn't have even bothered with the rest of the series. This is easily the worst in the series, with games that are hard to follow. There is one crossword puzzle game, for example, that gives you the worst possible definitions and expects you to find what their talking about. Another game expects you to move your mouse underneath both the ball and the correct answer. Yet another has you identify in ten seconds (Soon it will be less!) If it's an adverb or preposition, and then is it the main verb or the secondary verb? The final game, worst of all, takes a million years. You type in some random letters, hoping to guess the secret password. This last game is a bit easier if you write down all the letters of the alphabet and cross them off as you go- other wise you usually get real confused. I'm exagerating- as long as you already know a lot about reading, you'll be fine. And the plot is good enough to make up for most of it. Still, you might be better off with another Cluefinders game, like Cluefinders toy store adventure, or one of their 'grade' games- that is, third through sixth grade. If you can get it cheep, though, go ahead.And that's all I have to say.Russian Blue Witch (RBW)"

35462,1,"I have been using the CD's for about a week and I found them very helpful. I haven't used the CD ROM's yet, but I will get to those soon.I think this language learning kit is great for people who have already learned a language and now just want to learn another one. I learned french in high school and college and now I want to learn spanish. I pretty much didn't know anyhting about spanish before I started listening to the CD's. But now, after only 1 week, I know how to conjugate ir, er, and ar verbs and I know a lot more vocabulary.I don't recommend this product for anyone who is trying to learn a new language for the first time, but I do recommend it for anyone who already knows several languages and just wants to expand their langauge skills."

27606,1,"I have played all of the Nancy Drew games, and to me, Treasure in a Royal Tower is by far, the best one.In this game, Nancy Drew, 18 year old super-slueth, visits Wickford Castle and Ski Resort for a winter vacation. But when a terrible blizzard keeps her and 4 other guests stranded there, a mystery turns up. Someone has ransacked the library, and one guest claims an item of value of hers has been stolen. I wouldn't reccomend this game for people who have not played other Nancy Drew games, because the castle is VERY confusing (I got lost a bunch of times!), but all in all, this game rocks!"
8491,1,"I'm a direct response copywriter, which means that I often have to key in great quantities of text. Unfortunately, I am also a sufferer of carpal tunnel syndrome.Although I've only had this program for a few days, I find it has taken a lot of the stress out of inputting copy.As another user suggested, it seems best to dictate the words, and use your mouse or keyboard for formatting.The program works very well with e-mail and word processing. But as an added bonus, it seems to give you control over most functions of any Windows program!For example, when your desktop is on the screen, you say &quot;open Microsoft Word,&quot; and the program opens. Whoah, beam me up, Scotty! I would imagine that this program could be very useful to people with injuries or disabilities, not to mention &quot;lending a hand&quot; when your hands are full.The program does make some recognition errors, but then I do suffer a bit from marble-mouth myself. Fortunately, it's easy to correct mistakes by selecting the words in error, and then saying the correct word or selecting one of the choices the program presents you.Surprisingly, the program invites you to speak at your normal speed. Not to slow down as some earlier dictation programs forced you to do. There are also some passages they give you to read into the supplied headset microphone to improve the accuracy of the recognition.They say it takes about two weeks to optimize the program for your speaking pattern. I find the other challenge is simply getting used to dictation; as a touch typist and self-employed individual, I'm not accustomed to dictating documents to a secretary!The only reason I'm not giving this program five stars is because of the developer's stingy user support, as reported by other users here. When are manufacturers going to learn that it is imperative to provide a toll-free number for customers to call with product problems, and that customers should NOT be charged for the privilege either?Still, until another developer creates a product as good as this, NaturallySpeaking is probably the only game in town."
2947,1,"I have used most of the Home Design packages that are on the market today. In fact, I have been using Home Design software for over 25 years, and before that using a CAD system to design houses. This product is a professional series for the advanced user. Yes it may be a little more complicated than the others, but if you are ready to move to a product that the rest cannot touch, this is it. If you want a basic design package, try their 5 in 1 Home Design, the Super Home Suite, or the Professional Platinum series for more advance users. But if you want a professional product, Punch is really the option to go with. This package does not hold you hand as the beginner packages do, but they have products that will do this. Once you get past the beginning stages and are ready to move to the top of the line in design software, Punch Architectural Series is the one. On top of all the options and abilities it has, the Online Community will answer any questions you have. Just look for an online community for those other products and you will know who is using what software. This product will do it all and provide you with real details that you can really give to a home builder to build a house. Plus along with the house design, you get see what it really looks like with the addition of Master Landscape software. This addition allows you to see exactly what your home will look like with those trees, bushes, or flower gardens that will make this house yours. If you want a complete package with all the options, get the 3000 or 4000 series of Punch. It includes everything you really need to be your own designer and to see exactly what it will look like when built."

93096,1,"If I had to sum up this software in one word it would be - ""Wow"". From the minute I purchased it I was completely blown away! If you love technology and music as much as I do, then this is the software for you. You can convert your own music collection into MP3 files with the great of ease. To make things a little easier for yourself I would suggest that you sign on the Internet first to allow the computer to look up the name of the CD, artist, tracks, year, and cover art for your CD. When you place the CD into the CD drive you can review what songs you would like to place on your hard drive, check off the tracks (in the record mode), then covert. It does take practice on how to do this but once you get the swing of it becomes very easy. If your want to get advanced, you can also ""tag"" each track with additional information like mood, situation, tempo, etc. By breaking it down with such a great level of detail you can have better control of how you want to hear your music based on just a tempo, mood or whatever. Believe me when I say how wonderful it is to have the ability to listen to any kind of music at any given time without having to look for CDs anymore. I just go to my computer click on what songs I want to hear for that particular moment, and just relax. What completely won me over with this software is the fact that you can make CDs and covers effortlessly and quickly. My friends are very impressed with my finished CDs when I come to their homes with complication music for their parties and gatherings. They have a professional finish and wonderful flawless sounds from one track to the next. The magic of this software does not just stop at making music tracks from your CD collection. You can also create voice tracks by hooking up a mic to your computer, or you can hook up your stereo to make old records or tapes into MP3 files. I can go on and on, with what I have done with my MusicMatch but I am sure you get the point by now - just get it you will love it!"

I basically have to disable the firewall if I want to file share. I had to figure this out as there is no obvious clue from the software. Windows just tells me I do not have privilege to browse the local network.I have a 2.6 Ghz machine with 512M RAM. I don't see the memory problems or the slow down others speak of. It is probably because of the level of machine I have. I would not recommend this for machines less than 1.0 Ghz and less than 256 M RAM."

56368,1,Corel Painter IX had me eager to paint.Author's: Note I wasn't interested in painting until I used Corel Painter IX.I was pretty much not interested in painting until I saw a promotional offer for Painter IX and an animation software that complemented Painter IX. Now that Painter X had arrived. I downloaded a trial version to see if what is being offered could improve on the already wonderful Painter IX. The feature that caught my eye was Realbristle brushes. They seemed promising. I fooled around with Painter X for a few days following some online tutorials and I got lovely results.I had been using Painter IX recently and I have been painting for at least a short while so I won't lie and say that it creates the work for you. Online tutorials or being an experienced painter can really help you achieve good results. I mainly use vector software or draw so my painting isn't the best of the best but I'm motivated to learn because of the software's lovely capabilities.I recommend buying it even if you aren't a professional there are plenty of online tutorials and some community colleges offer non-credit courses in design software usage.

3237,1,"The way this software works is simple. It shows you four pictures and gives you a word or phrase describing each. Then it will ask you to match up pictures and phrases. Later sets of pictures build on vocabulary learned in earlier lessons to build up more complex phrases.The user interface is one of the easiest to use I've seen, and the sound and picture quality are better than I've seen from other language software. The reason I really like this software though is that it is the easiest and most effective learning method I've found. Rather than trying to memorize words, you hear them used in a bunch of different contexts until their use becomes natural. Also, this method is much better for developing listening comprehension than other methods, which are often mostly visual.This software doesn't explain any grammar rules. It merely tries to provide enough examples that they can be inferred from use. I find that having a grammar reference that I can refer to in addition to this software really helps with the trickier bits of the Japanese language, although for many things it is unnecessary.Overall, this software is expensive, but if you are serious about learning Japanese, I would say it is definitely worth the price."

I have zero complaints with WordPerfect 8 and couldn't see how my experience with it can be improved.I refuse to work with Microsoft Word.

I can't understand the life of me because there isn't a better word processor than WordPerfect 8.WordPerfect 8 is the greatest word processor I've ever used in my life, and I can't imagine myself typing a paper without it. It is the most painless word processor that delivers every single time I use it."
44891,0,"i've enjoyed using this in my piano studio, but have noticed one main problem. the theory is actually fairly advanced - key signatures, eighth notes and rests, intervals up to a seventh (maybe more), BUT, the graphics and animation (though way better than the Music Ace stuff) is more childish. My students who can actually do most of theory would not be interested in the graphics."
79016,1,THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM IF YOU NEVER OWNED AN OLDER VERSION OF FAMILY TREEMAKER. THE NEW VERSION IS SO SIMILAR TO THE OLDER VERSIONS IT DOESN'T PAY TO UPGRADE.
10794,0,"Nicely done and a good bit of variety, but we found it buggy in places (wrong answers, mostly). It's also quite hard for a first-grader: from the second level on up it's got tough multiplication and and three-digit subtraction. More to the point, the six-year-old proclaimed it boring, and I have to agree."
17683,2,"This was a BIG disappointment. My son absolutely loved Dry Cereal and couldn't wait to try another Spy Fox mission. The Dry Cereal game involved such fun problem solving and exploration my son felt like a junior detective. This game, on the other hand, is an old-school (bad) video game. Humongous Entertainment's web site redirects you to Atari's home page. It seems as though Atari might have purchased them and slapped the character's name on one of their existing games."
48765,1,I did have some problems with the earlier versions mainly in the spyware scanning and cleaning area. The latest version seems to improve a lot in this particular area. I did not notice any of the uninstallation and performance issues reported by others since I have a fast PC with no other AV software installed.
90892,1,"There is a ""learning curve"" for Word 2007, as it is slightly different than Word 2003. I used both before switching to 2007 exclusively. I hated ""styles"" in 2003 and I disliked the ribbon in 2007, but the ribbon is far easier to work around than styles. I still wish I could customize the ribbon, but in 2007, it is easier to create a typical document by setting your defaults and saving them as the ""Normal"" setting (with styles turned off)."

58496,0,"I purchased the Calendar Creator 12.1 and was pleased with the events section. I was making a 2 page calendar and I found it easy to cut and add pictures to the top page and move them around, add titles and generally work with it. I could even add background color with no problems if the pictures were not cropped. However if the picture was cropped, the picture would have a white square around it. When I changed the white square to match the background, I lost the ability to print the picture. I have sent 3 emails to their support section and have not received any reply. I really liked the rest of the program, and hope that they fix this problem in a newer verson. It would also be nice if they had a better support system."

49310,0,"I have an AMD fX-53 processor with an Geforce 6800 Ultra and 1 GB RAM. I installed vista so I could dual boot both Xp and Vista in case I did not like it. (Very recommended as it allows you to fall back on XP, but must partition hard drive with enough space).After installing Vista and using it for a month I'm back on XP. Vista has too many problems, is too slow, and the only change from Xp is that it looks different. I also dislike Vista asking me to 'approve' or 'deny' a move that I want to do. This feature gets really irritating and I don't see why the OS can't decide by itself whether to approve or deny that program. If you have XP Stay with it. If you want to upgrade to Vista, wait."
15348,0,"Hardly any padding for protection. Barely fits a 15.6&#34; laptop and cooling station stand with no extra room next to it. It does have a front compartment but you can only put flat items in it like files if you don't want to risk anything getting broken. No padding in front compartment. Couldn't fit my charger next to the computer or my mouse. Put the charger in the front flap and it bulked out. Was afraid it could break. For $23.00 more at ebags I got a laptop briefcase that holds my laptop, cooling station stand, charger and mouse. I was able to strap down my laptop in the sleeve & with enough room for the mouse to sit next to it and it came with a bag to hold the charger which fit next to the laptop. Plus storage in the top for pens, files, cell phone, ect... Plus you can lock it with your own combination. So for $44.00 including the shipping which this item was 60% off I can carry everything I need plus room for 2 IPads and more and extra protection."

91806,0,"There's some good things here (some nice fonts, for example), but ultimately I found using Comic Book Creator too frustrating. For example, the speech balloons reproduced with jagged edges. Also, the clip art bundled with the program is pretty lousy, though you can import your own.Worst of all, one has to choose the page layout as a first step. So later, if you decide you want to insert a frame between two others, it can't be done.Perhaps there are workarounds for these problems, but they weren't immediately apparent."
1794,1,"Have tried Delorme and others, and the MS Streets and Trips 2007 is still the best.

These should be move into another catagory."
12991,1,"I was discouraged to read some other reviews stating that the State Tax side of Turbo Tax didn't work, or work well, on Macs running OS X. My experience was just the opposite. I use an IBook running 10.3.4 and found that both federal and state (VA) Turbotax Deluxe worked perfectly. I recommend this product."
29819,1,"I am overall satisfied with the product. It warks fine with my XP and Vista PCs, and I did not have any problem in authorizing. The only downside is it uses a lot of memory. You may not want to run the scan while you are working on something."
39538,1,"This game has to be the best I've ever played. Not only can you follow just about any player theme (from the silent assassin to the armed-to-the-teeth grunt), but the augs add a whole new playing style. When I first got this game, after playing Half-Life (another fantastic game), I figured this would be about the same thing: story line, weapons, enemies, a goal. There is a story line, no doubt. Weapons kick some serious arse; there are about 20 different actual weapons, with some non-leathal weapons such as pepper guns and smoke grenades, and you can even throw plants to distract the guards! The enemies...the enemies vary. There aren't very many aside from the characters with names, but the good thing is that they're smart, they can hit you, take cover, etc. and they're loaded with different types of weapons. You never know what kind of enemy you'll face. But the goal is the most interesting part! Near the end, you'll have 3 paths to choose from; and that's just the beginning. There is always more than one way to get around something; usually there are two or more. That's the real beauty of this game; there's something in every room, and there are plenty of ways to get to them. I would rate this game 5 out of 5 because it's offered the best first person shooter experience to date."
7966,1,"I would have given this 5 stars primarily because I'm a Mac bigot but have to say that Tiger proved to be more stable and not as finicky. Granted, the cool new apps and features are really awesome but I've had to reinstall Leopard 3 times and considering a 4th because of performance issues. I see many more crashes than I did in Tiger because I have had so many problems, I'm hesitating installing Leopard on the rest of my Mac's. There are lots of dramatic changes to the file structures, specifically with regard to iCal and some of the others but when I used Backup to archive my files, upon restoring them iCal couldn't see my calendar data so I had to manually go in and re-add them to iCal.My personal .02 cents and for what its worth, I feel that Apple's shift to Intel processors, while performance is much quicker and perhaps cheaper to build, has cost them in performance. I know that my PowerBook G4 1.5GHz was vastly more stable than my MacBook Pro 2.33GHz but again, it may be the difference between Tiger and Leopard but I just don't know for sure until I load Leopard on my wife's iMac G5."
12766,1,"My experiences with Windows, which has been all of them above the originals...including 95, 98, 98SE, ME, NT, NTws, 2000, and now XP; well Windows XP by far comes out to be the best. Besides a very user friendly interface it's fast and reliable. While the system requirements are pretty &quot;up there&quot; this Windows is awesome for those who already obtain computers with the high MHz, and GHz processors. The Internet connection is also improved in my personal opinion. The program run more easily, and are easier to shut down when they crash. System Restore is fantastic with this version of Windows, especially during bad crashes where you'd usually have to go into SAFE mode to fix everything. The only downside I think it has is that it's differant from the other Windows in some appearances. While the user interface is easy to learn if you're new to computers...it may not be as easy if you've learned to do something one way, and now suddenly have to do it another. But other than that I've been very pleased with XP. I would recommend it to Business Owners and Home Users alike."
37282,2,"My son was VERY disappointed with the Island Odyssey game. He has played both the Logical Journey and the Mountain Rescue and loved them, so I thought buying the third one was a good idea. Instead, it was a WASTE of my money. It brought him to tears because it was so difficult too quickly - unlike the other versions that gradually get harder. If you're looking to buy a Zoombinis game - don't buy this one, buy either Logical Journey or Mountain Rescue instead."
91583,1,"My sister and I first got this game in a cereal box in the 90's when we were kids. It is educational and fun! As kids we didn't care that it was educational, it was just fun. :) It is still fun and I am 23!"
6684,1,"My three year old twins had not been anywhere near a computer when we introduced them to the computer with this game. This game is so appealing to children, and easy to follow and understand. It has several clear choices of games, based on real Fisher-Price toys, which all children are familiar with. Instructions are given verbally to the kids, with the objects blinking to demonstrate at the same time. In no time at all my kids learned to move the mouse and click on the toy of choice. After the pointing and clicking was learned, minimal parental help was needed. The program continues to give verbal and visual prompts and reminders, and the set-up is clear. Since this program also has several different games to choose from, any interest or skill can be used, keeping the short attention span of children stimulated. My kids love all the choices, from the vehicles used to get from point A to point B, to baking cookies, to working with tools, to matching shapes to fill in/build an object of choice (such as a castle), to building their own working car, to drawing or doing crafts, and on and on... This is a fantastic program for young ones. So fun, in fact, that I now have to limit computer use!"
32126,2,"This is one of the worst programs I've ever used. Period. I am a programmer, and I am really annoyed by bad, poorly thought-out software. My first indication was when I went to register, and they required a company name for HOME Architect. This is just plain sloppiness, and it gave me a bad feeling. Second, when I started the software, it dumped me to a blank screen, ready to go. No tour, no starting point. I went to the help, and the help file was useless. I went to the site, and they said there was a PDF manual. The manual is abysmal. By page 17, it tells you how to view in 2D and 3D. What good is that, when pages 1-17 say nothing about how to start a drawing?!Sample/demo files? I can't find any, and I'm pretty sure there are none. I saw on the Punch! website that the homes on their box covers were purchased from stock photography, not made with the software. This is utterly dishonest!More idiocy: The scrollbars let you leave the drawing area completely. In software design, this is considered malpractice. I accidentally got off the drawing area, and in trying to find my way back, I got lost, and the window started to flash wildly. Could the program get any more awful?Really, this software crosses the line from bad into the fraud territory."
89562,1,"I couldn't imagine a Microsoft OS to be stable and running without problems but that's exactly what Win2000 is. Some people were anxious about the fact that it doesn't run on older systems. Nowadays the minimum systems sold fit exactly the parameters that Win2000 needs. What I suggest: don't try it unless you have at least a Celeron 333 Mhz with 64 MB RAM (With this configuration it will run perfectly). Why is Win200 so good? It's a robust OS and has many applications that are easy to use and manage and it is user friendly with the Win98 interface. Do I sound like a MS ad? Yes I do but this time the ads were right. Hardware support isn't a problem now as all hardware have their Win2000 drivers, there are only few exceptions (sadly one of these was my modem).Installation is easy and the installer asks as few questions as possible, installing an ISDN-card or a network card is easy and is done during the installation process. The installation lasts about 30-45 minutes depending on the speed of your system. You can install the upgrade on a computer that doesn't contain an OS, because the installer demands the installation CD of the older OS so you can upgrade your system without tricks (that's what you had to do by Win98, it was tricky to get a new system from the Upgrade CD). Anyway you may keep your old system parameters as well when you are uprgrading. Yet better: when ou're upgrading from Win98 you may keep your programs too, and don't have to reinstall them again. Internet Connection Wizard is the same as in Win98 SE. It's not hard to connect to the internet. Creating a dual-boot system is much easier than in NT and Win98. You may have Linux, Win98 and Win2000 on one hard disk, in this case use the Linux Loader to boot your system, if you have only two Microsoft products on your hard disk, Win2000 recognises them and you may start it with the Win2000 loader.Win2000 is NT 5.0 so it is a multi-user system with an Administrator and Administrator configured users. You can give some administrative privileges for some users. Win2000 comes with NTFS 5, a new file system that is much better than NTFS 4 used in NT 4.0. Win2000 also supports FAT16 and FAT32. This means that you can drag your files created in the other OS to Win2000 without having any problems. There are many administrative tools in Win2000 and their use is really easy. Help is OK, it contains a lot of information and the processes can be understood by anyone. So you've got the feeling of Win98 but this OS is much better. I haven't had any crashes since I've been using it (9 months). This is a record.Of course Win2000 has some failures as well. For example it doesn't work well with Office2000, I had many problems with these two. Office2000 just won't start many times and installing Publisher from the upgrade CD is impossible (anyway this is a failure of Office2000 but the installer used in Office2000 and Win2000 is the same one).You should consider that if you plan to play with your machine, Win2000 isn't your choice. It supports many devices and has many drivers for them, but games aren't written for this OS. About 60-70 % of my games just won't run under this OS. This isn't a big problem for me as I use my machine for working purposes and if I want to play, I boot Win98. The best choice is to maintain a dual-boot system where you can choose what to do.Comparing Win2000 with former Microsoft OS-s, this is the best OS I've met by far and it is the best choice for anyone who doesn't want to learn Linux but wants to have a stable and working OS."
35434,2,"Spongebob Squarepants: The Battle for Bikini Bottom begins with a cut scene where Plankton fails yet again to take over Bikini Bottom. This time he tries robots, but they don't obey him and run rampant throughout Bikini Bottom. Supposedly, the aim of the game is to save Bikini Bottom from the robots.The actual game is woefully unrelated to the plot. Robots only surface a few times, at seemingly random intervals - they aren't a driving part of the game. The entire game is actually composed of a multitude of mini-games - including a game like the classic Snake, but with Gary - only a few of which were actually related to robots.Most often something rather pointless happens, like someone steals Mermaidman and Barnacle Boy's items, or else someone steals from the local Magic Shop, then the items are scattered over several mini-games.Graphics were mediocre - my friends and I marveled at how it was difficult to distinguish between what was 3D and 2D. Compared even to Half-Life, whose graphics are less exciting than the gameplay, this game is no match in art. Even in Half-Life there are transparent objects - where transparent objects in this game are obviously meant to be used, they are simply solid objects.Don't get me wrong; I do love Spongebob - that was the main reason for me to get the game - but even for something based on a cartoon that is rather ridiculous, this game is too plot-less to really enjoy."
47598,2,"I bought this because I'm a graphic designer and I have 1000+ fonts on my system at once. And that can really slow things down, and it can also really cause problems if just one of those fonts gets corrupted. So I thought I needed a big ""powerful"" solution like Suitcase. Turns out, the Font Book that is PART of OS X Panther, does everything I need. It lets you preview fonts, it lets you disable and enable them. Its a very powerful little app, and its FREE. Font Suitcase sucks. It doesn't seem to work at all. Its manual does very little to really explain how your supposed to really use the app. It doesn't explain things well at all. I'm a pretty smart guy, and I couldn't figure out how to get all my fonts into the program properly, and when I could get them to show up, I couldn't turn any of them on or off. Suitcase is a mess. It is a waste of money and a waste of time. Font Book, that comes with OS X 10.3 is the best app. So simple, so easy to use, so effective. So Apple."

40368,1,"Microsoft was long derided by its critics for having failed to fully grasp the Internet revolution. It was late in developing Net technologies such as a proprietary search engine and in coping with security threats propagated through the Web.Not any more. Earlier this year MSN rolled out a great search engine and now Microsoft has fundamentally revamped its reference products. By committing itself to this overhaul, Microsoft embraced reality: nine out of ten children (between the ages of 5 and 17) use computers (USA figures) - and 85% of these get their information online.The Microsoft Encarta Premium 2006 is a breathtaking resource. It caters effectively (and, at $50, affordably) to the educational needs of everyone in the family, from children as young as 7 or 8 years old to adults who seek concise answers to their queries. It is fun-filled, interactive, and colorful.The 2006 Encarta's User Interface is far less cluttered than in previous editions. Content is arranged by topics and then by relevancy and medium. Add to this the Encarta's Visual Browser and you get only relevant data in response to your queries. The Encarta Search Bar, which was integrated into the product two years ago, and is resident in the Task Pane even when Encarta is closed, enables users to search any part of the Encarta application (encyclopedia, dictionary, thesaurus, etc).The Encarta's new Web Companion is a (giant) step in the right direction. It obtains search results from all the major search engines without launching any additional applications (like a browser). Content from both the Encarta and the Web is presented side by side. This augmentation explicitly adopts the Internet and incorporates it as an important source of reference.It may raise important and interesting issues of intellectual property, though. Web content copyright-holders may demand royalties from Microsoft for the use it makes of their wares in its commercial products.Encarta would do well to also integrate with new desktop search tools from Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Users should be able to seamlessly access content from all over - their desktop, their encyclopedias, and the Web - using a single, intuitive interface.The Encarta Premium includes a dictionary, thesaurus, chart maker, searchable index of quotations, games, 32 Discovery Channel videos, 25,000 photos and illustrations, 2800 sound and audio clips, hundreds of maps and tables, and 400 videos and animations. It incorporates numerous third-party texts and visuals (including hundreds of newspaper articles and a plethora of Scientific American features).The Encarta is augmented by weekly or bi-weekly updates and the feature-rich online MSN Encarta Premium with its Homework Help offerings. Unfortunately, the Encarta still conditions some of its functions - notably its research tools and updates - on registration with its Plus Club.The Encarta is the most comprehensive, PC-orientated reference experience there is. No wonder it has an all-pervasive hold on and ubiquitous penetration of the child-to-young adult markets. Particularly enchanting is the Encarta Kids interface - an area replete with interactive quizzes, pictures, large icons, hundreds of articles, and links to the full version of the Encarta. A veritable and colorful sandbox. Those kids are going to get addicted to the Encarta, that's for sure!Encarta actively encourages fun-filled browsing. It is a riot of colors, sidebars, videos, audio clips, photos, embedded links, literature, Web resources, and quizzes. It is a product of the age of mass communication, a desktop extension of television and the Internet.Inevitably, in such a mammoth undertaking, not everything is peachy. A few gripes:Regrettably, installation is not as easy as before. The Encarta 2006 makes use of Microsoft's .Net technology. As most home computers lack it, the installer insists on adding it to the anyhow bloated Windows Operating System. There is worse to come: the .Net version installed by Encarta 2006 is plagued with security holes and vulnerabilities. Users have to download service packs and patches from Windows Update if they do not wish to run the risk of having their computers compromised by hackers.Fully installed, the Encarta Premium 2006 gobbles up more than 3.5 Gb. That's a lot - even in an age of ever cheaper storage. Most homesteads still sport PCs with 20-40 Gb hard disks. This makes the Encarta less suitable for installation on older PCs and on many laptops. Despite the hype, relatively few users possess DVD drives (but those who do, find the entire encyclopedia available on one DVD).The Encarta DVD 3-D tours have improved but they still hog computer resources and are essentially non-interactive. Is it worth the investment and the risk to the stability and performance of the user's computer?The Encarta tries to cater to the needs of challenged users, such as the visually-impaired - but is still far from doing a good job of it.The atlas, dictionary, and thesaurus incorporated in the Encarta are outdated. Why not use a more current - and dynamically updated - offering? What about dictionaries for specialty terms (medical or computer glossaries, for instance)? The Encarta's New English Dictionary dropped a glossary of computer terms it used to include back in 2001. All's the pity.But that's it. Encarta is a must-buy (especially if you have children). The Encarta is the best value for money around and significantly enhances you access to knowledge and wisdom accumulated over centuries all over the world. The amount and quality of content squeezed into a $50 package (before rebate) defies belief. I am a 44 years old adult but when I received my Encarta Premium 2006, I was once more a child in a land of wonders. How much is such an experience worth to you?

This past year (filing year 2005), I experienced some glitches and found it impossible to get anyone at TurboTax to answer my questions in any useful way. The software is generally OK, but it becomes useless if you have any problems with it."
80482,1,"I upgraded from Creative Suite CS2 and Macromedia Suite MX 2004. Adobe has rewritten the software in both suites to work together like they had always been one integrated product. The transformation is truly astounding. It is obvious that Adobe wants to be your one-stop solution to anything related to web design and web page building and this package will blow away the competition.You can layout your pages in photoshop, using all it's creative power including layer's. Generally, you want common areas on each page of your site to give it a unified feel. For the areas that will differ from page to page, just use a different layer for each variation. This means you won't have to rebuild the common areas for each page of your layout. This is a huge time saver since those layers are also accessible in both Fireworks and Dreamweaver now.Pull the photoshop page layout into fireworks to add hotspots and create html mockups of each page of your site for the customer. The hotspots allow you to actually link from page to page in the html mockups. That way your customer can get a sense of graphic look of the site and how you move from page to page early in the design process and without you having to move everything to the host site. After they approve the overall page design and flow, you can pull the same photoshop layout into dreamweaver and use it as a tracing sheet to create your css stylesheets. The css stylesheets have much greater support under this version of Dreamweaver. They provide lots of premade CSS stylesheets that you can use as is or easily modify to suite your needs.Once your stylesheets are defined, you can copy elements of your photoshop page layout to add images to your web page in Dreamweaver. Another nice feature is the ability to optimize photoshop images for the web from right inside Dreamweaver. If you need illustrations to add to your pages, Illustrator has been as tightly integrated as Photoshop. Just create your illustration and you can copy it right in. If you want to include common elements across a large number of pages, create a template - that way later changes to the common areas just need to be made to the template instead of every page!I haven't had a chance to work with Flash yet. The new features list is pretty impressive. Can't wait to dive in! I also have not yet worked with the new features to preview how your web pages will look on other devices like phones and ipods. If that works well, it will make designing web pages for the new devices a lot easier.All in all, Adobe has done a great job integrating all this software so that you can use the best of each tool to create well designed powerful web pages with a minimal amount of effort. Well worth the bucks!"

59537,1,"Many great reviews exist already, so I'll just say that this device is easily worth twice the retail price for me. It works like a charm and the software provided is top-notch. The sound quality is great, and there is no noticeable delay in the sound (unlike the AmpliTube software). This is without a doubt the most satisfying purchase (of any type) I've made in a long time...and I just bought my first HDTV ;)"
42265,1,"This has got to be one of the most under publicized Microsoft products in their vast software library. I also think it is one of their better products. One of the coolest things is if you do a lot of research on the web when you copy from the web it adds the reference to the original source at the bottom of the copy so you never have to try to figure out where it came from or re-Google to try to find the source, just double click on the source. Also very cool is its abilty to read and search for word text in screen shots from any application that you paste into OneNote. So if you find yourself getting a little overwhelmed with data this is just about the niftiest organizer on earth. I have many GB in my notebooks and the search is very fast."
3162,0,"This programs is good listening practice,and offers somewhat useful speech practice, and writing practice, but thats about it. There is no grammar practice at all. In Spanish this is critical. Learning verb conjugations are boring, but you simple have to understand them, same with pronouns ect. The Speech practice and writing exercises are simple repeating, and writing the Spanish you hear. This will do little for your ability to speak, because your going to have to translate the English to Spanish in your head, and vis versa. How can you say anything If you don't know for sure what the words and phrases mean.This is the way children learn right. (...). Want to say I want this or I need that, your out of luck, because this program does not show, or explain how. Everything in this course is third person. You get ton's of the boys are jumping, the girls are running ect. If you go to a Spanish speaking country how useful is this going to be? Like your going to strike up a conversation about someone else with a native Spanish speaker? No verb conjucations for I, you, we!!! A small problem considering you will use these verb conjucations at least 70-80% of the time in the present tense.If you get this course you need a dictionary, a verb conj. book, and if you can afford it the pimseur series, or Barron's FSI (IF you don't have the money). After about half way into the course I stopped, because I felt like I was on a vocabulary treadmill, learning new vocabulary words and little else. That's when I orders some good workbooks like Spanish the Easy way, The the practice makes perfect books, and wishing I would have bought these books first, as I use them and the pimsleur course, and put this course on the backburner. Anyway I will say that sadly this course is by far the best software program available for learning languages, but it's lacking and way overpriced for what you will get out of them. If you want to learn how to speak the language this is not the course for you. If you want to work on listening comprehention, and vocabulary building than you may like it."
33362,1,"Was weary of this product based on previous reviews. My Norton anti virus was expiring and I was tired of how system works slows my system. Installed system suite and must admit it didn't seem to work right. I then downloaded the most recent update and that solved the problem. So far so good. Norton would take an hour or longer to defrag a 120 Gig drive, system suite does it in about 15 minutes or less. I really like the startup commander. It tells you what all the junk that loads when you start your computer is and tells you if it is safe to disable it. I have run the registry cleaner and my computer still works!!"
82347,2,"True Image works great, unless it fails. The program has saved me several times, but that was when it was working properly. I recently learned that if you encounter a problem, you're on your own. Acronis now outsources their support to people who have big trouble communicating and understanding technical issues. Worse yet, the only option available is email--there is no way to actually talk to anyone. I've been in the computing field for over 25 years, and Acronis has the worst level of support I've ever encountered from a software company. Believe me, if anything goes wrong, you're on your own. You definitely don't want to find yourself in a situation where you've lost your data and the recovery program isn't working properly. There are real problems with True Image which can show up at the most inopportune times. That applies to all versions, including the latest one. So if you want a backup program you can count on, and a company you can turn to when you need them most, you definitely don't want True Image by Acronis."

22211,0,"This is a fun game, but I got creeped out from all the talk of ghosts. It is pretty hard, as you have to figure out a lot of puzzles and open a lot of locked boxes and doors before progressing on to the next part of the game. I was disapointed when I learned that Frank and Joe Hardy will not help me much. They prefer to sit in the dining car and sort through evedence. It is a pretty scary mystery because strange things have happened on the train and everyone thinks that the ghost of the train conductor's wife has done it. That, along with the rumblings that the train makes and all the big empty cars, make for a creepy game. My favorite part is finally catching on to a part that was giving me trouble. Still, if you are one of the chicken-hearted, DON'T GET THIS GAME!"
23938,1,I like it but its hard for me to get things on it figured out but I did make my grandson a B-day card but it came out much bigger than I wanted I don't know how to resize the stuff. I'll keep trying :) thanks
32293,1,"I've been using McAfee VirusScan software for about 6 years, and Version 8.0 for almost a year and I've never had any problems with it. The updates are automatically installed, and lately seems like there is an update every couple days .. I just get an informational message that it's been installed for me. I've never been infected with a worm or virus in the last 6 years, so I can't speak to what kind of experience one has with the McAfee support staff if does happen. But then again, I consider it must have pretty good protection if I've never been infected even once when many people I know have been. (I am also running the ZoneAlarm Pro firewall, which I very highly recommend.) I bought Ver 8 because I was used to the McAfee user interface, and several PC magazines rated it tops recently. One thing that disappointed me about the most recent version is that they no longer have a logging mechanism to keep track of what happens during a scan (I was trying to run scans through WIN XP Task Scheduler and wanted to make sure scans were running properly ... And by the way, when I sent McAfee support an email message asking about this, I received a response in less than 24 hours, explaining that indeed the logger was removed in version 8, and by the way there's currently a bug in WIN XP Task Scheduler functionality.) All in all, I'll stick with McAfee..."
59535,1,"This is a wonderful and CHEAP addition to anyones electric guitar equipment arsenal. Every single guitarist with a computer should own this, as it enhances the simplicity of recording and practicing guitar riffs for only 100 bucks. I've done a bit of recording in my past, and I've found that it is SO much easier to lay down a nice sounding guitar track using the Guitarport as opposed to recording a real amplifier. It's quick, and sounds as good - in some instances (depending on your microphone, amp, mixer/effects, and room acoustics) it sounds BETTER than anything you could do otherwise.For those who just want a good practice tool, the Guitarport is a great way to learn the sound of different types of amplifiers, how to work with tone control (equalization), and the sounds of different effects. There simply is no cheaper and practical way to do this than with a Guitarport. Also, since jamming along with good song mp3's is a must for learning guitar, using the jam-along feature in Guitarport is excellent. Or you can do what I do - play from my itunes playlist while Guitarport software is running.It seems that there is now a ""Toneport"" that may be a better buy than this (I don't know much about it), but I must say that besides buying the Guitar itself, this Guitarport was the most worthwhile purchase I made as a learning guitarplayer. I would recommend it to anyone who plays the electric guitar."

43248,1,"Microsoft Home and Student 2007 is a surprise right off the bat, with a totally different look than 2003. I recommend taking a product tour or going through a tutorial--there are a lot of changes! Microsoft has attempted to make the programs easier to use by presenting icons in tabs when you need to perform a certain task. Word 2007: As a student currently working on a master's degree, I was very pleased to see the Bibliography help and being able to choose APA formatting. It is helpful when listing citations in a References section. Word now has some Publisher characteristics, which is good because Publisher does not come in this version."
20606,2,"Pinnacle Studio 8 offers a great deal and for those fortunate enough to successfully install the software, it very well might. Unfortunately, this system is rife with problems. A ten-digit serial number is required for installation but an eleven-digit S/N is provided instead. This problem can be fixed if one is willing to work through the maze of troubleshooting tips at the Pinnacle website. Furthermore, we received an addendum with instructions to load a driver (as a fix) during the installation process. Going to the correct folder on the CD, I discovered that the driver does not exist. However, these are minor problems when compared to the damage that Studio has inflicted on a computer that is more than adequate to run Studio (according to Pinnacle's system requirements). The software is causing slowdowns and the machine to crash. Even uninstall will not fix the problem! There are endless patches but none work. Tech support is almost non-existent. The most popular suggestion offered by Pinnacle seems to be to upgrade to a different version but as this requires spending additional money on a proven failure I see no reason to throw good money after bad. It has been a $100 waste with the further frustration of troubleshooting the damage caused by Studio 8 to Windows. Successful installation appears (according to others who have been more fortunate) to provide excellent results. But, given the large number of dissatisfied customers, including our own family, I would strongly discourage anyone from taking a chance on purchasing this software in the expectation that it will work."
82034,0,I bought these games to play with my kids in Speech Therapy. I like that the game saves your progress along the way. But be careful; these games don't work on Windows 7. My opinion is very middle of the row on these.
29953,1,"I've written reviews in the past on Norton products. I personally, have never had any issues installing, uninstalling, reinstalling, or upgrading any Symantec product. I know that they happen and I feel for all those who have had issues. I know for many in my family who have had issues that I've had to rectify, the majority of the problems arise from installing Norton over the top of a different (or even other Symantec) security/antivirus software package.The first thing you need to do before you install this software is go to Add/Remove programs in your control panels. Remove all of the 3rd party security software you have installed (any Norton, Symantec, McAfee, Panda, Kaspersky, etc). Then Restart. You may need to restart more than once as directed by the software uninstaller. Following this procedure I have successfully installed this software without problem on more than two dozen of my own computers and probably more than two dozen of my family's and friends' computers. This seems to be one of the most complained-about issues in the other Norton Reviews.Second, price. You can pretty much always get Norton almost free. There are always twenty dollar rebates for upgrading. All you have to do is send them an old Norton (or other antivirus software) CD or box top. If you don't have one of these you can usually buy an old Norton or other security software cd on ebay for under $5. There are other rebates usually available as well tied in with Turbotax. I think this year I actually got paid $10 to buy Norton Internet Security Suite 2007 - 3 user suite. I split the 3 user licenses among other family members making it an even better deal. The 3-user package is priced almost the same as the single user package, so make sure you buy the 3-user package.Thirdly, while the software does indeed slow the computer down, I rarely am annoyed by it. The only real problem that I have had that makes me drop my rating from 5 to 4 stars is that the process of downloading emails into outlook is slowed down quite a bit as it doesn't move onto the next message until the previous one is totally scanned. I have noticed an improvement in the functionality of Norton software since 2005 when it was particularly bloated, but still functional.Finally, and this is the gold standard for any review I will write of an antivirus software: I have never gotten a virus almost 10 years of having computer and running Norton products. This is more than many of my friends and family can say who have tried to save money or mildly boost computer performance by going with a different package. I don't know if I can attribute this to Norton or just cautious internet use. But I do know that my computer and those computers of family members that I maintain who have had a never-lapsed Norton Antivirus software package installed have NEVER gotten a virus that was not immediately detected, quarantined, and repaired or removed. That is why I will continue protecting all of my computers with Norton Software.[...]"
22631,1,"I'm startled, frankly, by the poor reviews for this product. My wife and I fiddled around with floor plans using this software for a couple of years until we got it just the way we wanted, then took the printouts to a contractor. His guy drew it out to plans, and nine months later we had the home of our dreams. Typical of any unfamiliar software, it was a little confusing at first to figure out how to use the tools, but with a little practice, that became routine. Yeah, the roof thing is problematic, but that's not what you should expect out of something for this price. We saved about $25K on the construction costs by not having to have an architect and are delighted to have designed our house ourselves."
61374,1,"We have really enjoyed this product. It is much more patient than I would be if I were the teacher! :) The program is very flexible and offers a lot of variety. I am reluctant to give it five stars because one of the games (piano metronome) is difficult to understand and use, and there is no option to remove it from the repertoire. Otherwise, it is really a great product. In response to Bertha's comment about period spacing. In the user settings (accessible at the welcome screen) you can choose whether you want 1 or 2 spaces following a period. I share her frustration with the change from 2 spaces to 1. I was taught the two space method, and it has taken quite some time to break the habit. Happy typing!"

55918,1,"I love the Jumpstart Preschool program my son currently has. He has spent a long time &quot;playing&quot; and I know he is also learning. There is a testing part that evaluates what your child knows and sets the difficulty rate accordingly. He loves doing the test as much as the rest. I was so impressed with the first one I purchased, that when asked, I requested Jumpstart programs for my son for Christmas. I know he will love them and so will his twin brother and sister when they get a little bigger. I recommend this product if you are looking for something educational and also fun for your child."
30637,0,"I am a bit disappointed.This is a cute program,but it really doesn't have much to offer.You start in front of Mickey's house,and from there you choose where you want to go.There is letters,counting,shapes and music,but it is very limited in what it does.You can print out activities ( which my daughter could care less about) but I bought it for the computer experience not paper and crayon."
38936,1,"Thought I would get one of these XP discs from an Amazon merchant, since Microsoft no longer makes it available. My OEM disc somehow got scratched and I need to be able to re-install on my 1/2 MB laptop. Vista would never get by with that small of a memory footprint. ""techdiscount"" merchant sent if fast, good price $116.00 and it passes the MS authentication test, shrink-wrapped. I would buy from them again."
32573,1,I am 17 and studying for the ACT. I checked out several titles from the library and this is by far the best! You take diagnostic tests and it customizes your review to help your weak points.

49777,0,"The last version of this program worked well for me on my high-powered twin-engine Dell with a gig of RAM, so I decided to try Version 11. Tried many times to do the standard installation, only to get I/O errors or a freeze-up. The CD did look a little scratched, so I returned the product and tried again with new discs -- same problem. Nothing wrong with my computer or CD drives, because other programs on disc install fine.Finally, I thought of selecting ""minimal install"" and got it running. Must be a corrupt or problem file in there somewhere. No big deal, because I'm not really interested in many of the flowery extras. I mostly wanted the ability to use .TIF images with alpha channel info, because for stills, that works much nicer than alpha-keying with blue or green screen. There is also supposed to be better handling of pan and zoom on stills--we'll see...I haven't burned any discs yet.The old version rarely crashed or froze even with many individual movies open. This new version has already crashed with a single small project. Time will tell if I can work around the bugs or patch them up.For the price and the features, this software is fantastic and I'd give it 5 stars, but I believe the installation routine was quite crappily written and its stability issues are still to be determined. If you're happy with the old version and don't care about using .TIF images or stock 3D tricks which are mostly garbage, don't bother with the upgrade. And if you have problems installing it, try the minimal install--you'll still get the revised core program and most of the effects."
7798,1,"I was fed up with Norton so when my husband asked me buy anti-virus software for his new laptop I knew it wasn't going to be Norton. After reading the reviews here on Amazon I decided to try OneCare.We like it so much that we installed in on new desktop, as well.I haven't had one virus and I like that it let's me know what's going on with my pc while I'm online."
27574,1,"My sons and their friends, also boys, had a great time with this game. It's too bad that it is marketed and designed for just girls, because it is a wonderful, challenging mystery game for all; even some adults get hooked, yes, men too. There is no reason why boys will not enjoy this mystery adventure! Maybe the Hardy Boys will come out with a version. Until then I'm going to buy more Nancy Drew software at the request of my sons."
13577,1,"I had my first look at Office 2003 while it was still in Beta - which was kind of buggy (mostly Outlook) - but the production release of Office 2003 is well worth the money, and seems very stable. I upgraded from Office 2000 sp4, and find that Office 2003 has tighter integration, more functionality, better filters and rules in Outlook, and incredible prospects with the XML function set that enables easy exchange of information with other platforms and systems.The Business Contact Manager in Outlook makes keeping track of your suppliers and customers easier than ever! Just register the contact as a business in Outlook, and all documentation created through Outlook is automatically attached to their business profile - basically creating a one stop data pool for each registered business client.I use SQL, mySQL, and Access as data tools, and find the XML functionality in Access is great for moving data from one format to another. It's also very useful for creating data driven XML documents for use in front ends built with Flash MX.While Word and Excel are pretty much the same, with a few added bells and whistles, the newer functionalities in Outlook and Access make my life easier and definitely pay for the upgrade in saved time.Amazon offers the lowest price out there (beleive me when I tell I've looked around) on the upgrade. Add the availability of rebate offers through Amazon, and you really can't go wrong.Happy computing!BocGet a Life Style!http://www.getalifestyle.org"
92830,0,"I purchased this dvd because I liked Dragon's Lair and Space Ace so much. Overall, it's a neat concept, but the game is slow and confusing. It seems like I spent much of my time going in circles and I quickly became bored with this dvd.The animation is interesting to watch, but it is not of the same caliber as Dragon's Lair or Space Ace. Also, the navigation on this dvd is ugly and painful.This dvd game is based on the hit arcade game Thayer's Quest. Think of it as a kind of animated Zelda adverture, where you explore a strange land, collect items, etc."

62120,1,"This version is a stand-alone solfware. The 3-in-1 is good enough and does not slow down my lowest Pentium 2.00GHZ desktop among 5 including laptop and desktop. To avoid errors during installation, some steps need to be done as follow:_ Enable 'update' on System startup if it has been disable for any reason._ Use the same ID logon when it is already registered and is for one-user only_ Remove all antivirus programs that have the same function on this 3-in-1._ Install onto each PC one at the time; otherwise, an error 'Not Protected' will appear._ It can be installed 1 or 2 of 3 separately by using customize option._ Run Update on Security center before restaribg system.This 3-in-1 is runing good on my PC's without any errors since I have bought on 11/12/06."

78570,1,"I have tried several home design programs over the last few years. This one was the easiest, provided the most, was the most adaptable, and was the cheapest! I couldn't believe it!It is so easy to use, but offers many, many features. Lots of choices of furniture, windows, walls, colors; and most of them can be changed to your exact dimensions.This program offers a 3-D walk-through, floor plans, and everything you need to design your own special house from scratch, or to decorate just one room.The 3-D shows the room so well--it will save lots of furniture moving! You can see how things fit and look. And the custom colors on the walls and furniture are great! Really lets you see how the room will turn out.The dimensions of the flat floor plans can be changed easily. There are sample home plans and room plans for folks with less creativity, or make a floor plan that matches your own home, or design your dream home. Almost everything works with point, click, and drag, or you can put in numerical dimensions and the program does it for you.I am no artist, and have no CAD abilities, but I was able to do a layout of our whole house quickly and easily. Next I will do our dream home!I can't say enough good things about this program. Wish I had found it before I wasted my money on the others."
24444,1,"My kids were driving me crazy about buying this game. When we finally received it, we had a problem with the New York font on the Mac but we finally were able to get the software to work on one of our older PC's.It's a little bit of a dose of the harsh realities of the lives of the pioneers, but fun all the same. It's hard to stop because you really want to make it to the West coast.My son is eight and pretty tough, but I wouldn't recommend it for kids who are much younger."
14586,1,"I've been using FrontPage 2002 for a couple of months now and I love it.I haven't had any problems making my site cross-browser compatible and I have tested in it all the major browsers, including Opera.I like the web component functions, it makes adding things like DHTML effects and changes on demand quite simple. The insert form function makes adding forms for emails and guestooks a breeze.It's also nice to just use one program for designing and uploading my files.The main drawback I can see is locating a host that allows FrontPage extensions, but with some research this can be accomplished and not at a high price for hosting."

56771,1,"At only $2,000 this bundle is an extraordinary bargain. When I saw the price I couldn't believe my eyes. I would have been more than happy to have paid four or five times what they're asking. Of course, I bought this product immediately, worried that the low price wouldn't last. I haven't actually read many of these since receiving them and two of the DVD-ROMs don't work properly, but just knowing I have them (right now they're resting comfortably under my bed) gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling."
8188,1,"Although this update is not as big as the one from 5.5 to 6.0, it is still worth buying. Actually the healing brush/healing patch tool itself is worth the price of the upgrade. When you think of it, how many of us digital photographers would gladly pay that price for a plug-in that helps us fix blemishes, scratches and wrinkles in a couple seconds?Another nice addition is the file browser. See all your pictures at a glance, rotate them, classify them, rate them, etc. You can also view all the metadata (data added by your digital camera), such as date taken, exposure, color profile, and others.Adobe also reworked (OK... fixed) Contact Sheet, Web Gallery, and Picture Package. Those actually work now, and they'll do exactly what you want them to. I agree it should have been done right in the first place, but I'm just too happy they are usable now.Photoshop 7.0 also lets you save your workspace. You can now place all your tabs and windows just the way you like them, and save the positions. I have 3 or 4 different workspaces I toggle through, depending on what I'm working on. This is a huge time saver. Once again, this could have been done before, but I'm glad it finally found its way to Photoshop.Conclusion: the healing tool itself is worth the price. Think of the rest as a bonus. :)"

41677,1,"A very functional beginner software program that can handle most business needs for small databases in all sizes of companies. It is simple to use and to learn. What it lacks is even simple look-up functions that you were able to get with the older versions of Filemaker Pro (I suspect you can script these &quot;look-up&quot; fields, but it is not intuitive). I have assigned it to a number of my courses."
55867,1,"I run a very small business so every penny counts. I do all of the bookkeeping and accounting myself using Quickbooks. What is great about the Turbotax system is that Quickbooks feeds right into the program and does most of the work for me. In addition, it does a great job depreciating my equipment for me. The product is just as easy to use as the Personal tax software as it walks you through everything. I couldn't live without Turbotax. It doesn't replace hard work, but it sure helps with it."
78655,1,"I recently purchased Punch! Master Landscape Pro v10.0, altho having read some of the reviews I almost decided against this purchase. I'm glad I went ahead, clearly some of the negative comments I've seen are from people that did not take time to read the instruction book or even try the help functions. For example, someone said you could only change two dimensions of a 3D display - incorrect. You can only edit two dimensions at a time, but all three can be modified. There certainly is a learning curve involved, but that's to be expected with any new software.I did find the ""masking"" function to be cumbersome when importing plant photos (yes, contrary to some reviews, it's quite possible to import digital images and use them in the designs). Instead, I masked them w/Adobe photoshop and then imported them.A couple things - I wish you could organize the plants in both directories rather than just in the custom directory. And I should say that I purchased this for landscaping designs so I've done little with the building design functions.Overall I found the program reasonable and useful to create potentail garden & landscape designs. Great for winter planning and reviewing different options/ideas."
6645,0,"I purchased this CD-rom at a large discount retailer for about $6.50. That's about how much it's worth. If I had paid more than that, I think I would feel ripped off.The best way to describe ""Time, Money & Fractions, Grades 1-2"" is as an electronic workbook. It is not really what I would classify as a computer ""game"". The exercises do offer some good reinforcement of basic skills, but I have to sit with my daughter while she uses this program in order to explain/interpret the directions and to help her find the keys on the keyboard. My six-year old is probably ""gifted"" (we homeschool so I really have no clue if she technically is gifted, but teachers I know say that she probably is) who has a pretty long attention span, but even she finds the exercises to be challenging, bordering on monotonous.I wouldn't really classify this disc as ""making learning fun"". It only real use is to make learning electronic and offer a slight variety to filling out workbook pages.Also, I am able to run this on OS X on my Mac."
12791,0,"I get basically access to every major OS through my school. I first upgraded to XP Professional from Windows 98 and other than the silly general interface which I quickly changed, was very happy with it. My first irritation came from the way it listed internet explorer on the task bar, open up more than three IE windows and it cascades them into one, if there was a way to change that setting I could not find it. That was really only a minor irritation.The only problem I had with my applications was that I could not find a driver for my DVD decoder on my graphics card. So I lost the ability of DVD playback on my PC, no big deal as I rarely used that anyway of late.Then the big problem came one day. All of my desktop icons, became scrambled one day. I was able to switch about half of them back to the correct icon, but the other half were stuck. Restarting had no effect on getting the correct desktop icons.Not soon after the desktop icon problem I started getting considerable lag on the computer, which is a AMD 1gig machine with 384 Mb of RAM.The only other problem was created with the horrible ISP I am forced to work with. I can connect to the internet fine on my main machine and have it networked with another machine also running XP on a clean install. The two computers comunicate well in all facets except for the internet. Clicking on internet explorer on the second machine will cause the ISP on the first to dial up, and it will connect yet it shows disconnected on both machines interface. Maybe a minor inconvience except that it has to many set up wizards for the network that don't give me the control to make the nessary adjustments that I am familiar with on earlier versions like NT or 9x. I'm sure it could be resolved but I am just too unfamiliar with XP to know how to get around those setup wizards.The only other major problem I encountered is that I have a gaming system and most of my games are very happy with the Fat32 file system, on the clean version of XP, you have to go to extensive searches looking for updated drivers.In the end I switched back to Windows 98, I don't mind the occaisional restart. I may still run XP on a dual boot system but that is only because I did not have to pay for it since I got it through my school."

Who in their right minds wants their financial data online!! Schmucks. #2 For some strange reason I thought I could import QIF files successfully into Money, this is so funny. Money tried to perform complex math such as addition and subtraction and I could not get a correct balance to save my life. I was shocked that the program just couldn't add/subtract at all. #3 If you for some chance get curious and decide to try MSN Money (.NET/Passport), Money 2005 will lock your Money file and you'll have to sign into .NET to view your money file. They say it protects your file. I think it just makes it easier for them to spy since you've logged into the .NET. Ok After some frustration, I decided to heck with it I'll try to go back to 2003. Gosh what was I thinking. 2003 couldn't open the 2005 file and kept asking me for the .NET password that I typed in correctly but the program says is wrong. Cool, so I'll just install 2005 and open the file and just deal with it. 2003 somehow corrupted the file and backup file just by looking at it so I lost ALL my financial data. I beg you PLEASE PLEASE don't upgrade to 2005. Im sticking with 2003 and I have Quicken 2005 as a back up. Sometimes less is more. Gosh the team that wrote 2005 should all be led out to pasture. Im posting the software to ebay for $-5.00, I'll pay them to take it from me! Also don't buy the software in the store like I did w/o reading reviews first.

31985,0,"Been using this for about a month now. Overall cannot see any great improvement over using Quick Gamma, which is free, but then again, I've got an inexpensive AOC CRT monitor, and a laptop LCD monitor with the notorious Radeon Mobility card that won't allow external programs to write to it.Anyway, I've calibrated to all the settings on the menu and also tried to achieve the 2.2 gamma, 5800 color temperature profile suggested with the ambient light option turned on. The latter was not doable with my monitor. I also saved ALL the profiles produced. Bear in mind, each profile was produced using different brightness, contrast, and color temperature settings, all of which were set outside the program, using the control knob on the monitor itself.Here are a couple of things that were weird for me with respect to the CRT. EVERY ONE of the profiles produced is apparently identical. The screen color or brightness do not change one little bit, no matter which profile is selected as default in the windoze xp pro display properties color management menu. Nor is there one bit of difference among them within Picture Window Pro color management, as each is selected in turn as the monitor profile Second, the so-called before-and-after display at the end of the calibration process is a joke. The before picture does not resemble my display prior to running the program at all, and this before picture is identical after each calibration, no matter what the prior settings were.On the LCD, there is no difference between the before and the after picture, which I chalk up to the stubbornness built into the Radeon Mobility card, nor is there a bit of difference among the profiles, built under differing parameters as with the CRT, in Picture Window Pro color management, though they all produce a different, but identical, set of colors and brightness levels than produced by the profiles from other hardware manufacturers.So, as stated, maybe it's just me. Or, maybe it's a function of how little my monitor cost, though it produces great colors for me, as I will address next. But, I'm not quite convinced that Spyder2Pro was really worth it for me.Fortunately, I bought the suite that includes PrintFixPro 2.0. Now that program is a whole 'nother story. My old (ancient by computer time) Epson Stylus Color 1520 and its little sibling, the 600, print what I see on the screen all the time now. Even the black and white comes out right, after adding the extended gray measurements to the printer profiles produced.Conclusion: for me Spyder2Pro seems a bit of a joke, because I can calibrate by eye, with a little help from Quick Gamma, and produce as good a picture; PrintFixPro 2.0 is great. A little tedious, printing, drying, and reading the patches, but the result is worth it. Sort of wish I'd bought it as a standalone, but then its being bundled with the Spyder only cost about $100 more. Someday, I might have a monitor where the Spyder will do more good. As it is, what I see is what is printed, and that's what I was after, Spyder or no.[...]"

93808,1,"Adobe's Audition is probably the nicest and cleanest looking audio editing desktop environment I've seen. I liked the way in which you can import a CD track directly without having to launch a CD player beforehand, and the `Save As' options are plentiful.You also have 128 tracks onto which you can have music and sound effects for when you're making digital videos, and are able to synchronize these tracks with an editing application such as Adobe's Premiere, to get around its usable. but limited. audio capabilities.Audition can also apply many temporal and tonal effects.Not so very long ago you needed racks of outboard gear including timecode locked multi-track tape-machines costing tens of thousands of dollars to do the basics of what can be done with Audition. I look back at that time and am frankly amazed at how much today's powerful PCs allied to inexpensive software can do for those interested in audio and digital film production without breaking the bank.This is a very good and sophisticated product that goes beyond the basics that many people would require, but if they are anticipating the need to go beyond a basic editing application, Audition would be a great choice.Be sure to use a fast, up-to-date computer, with lots of hard drive space - preferably as separate hard drives attached to independent IDE or RAID controllers - if you intend to be doing complex projects. Also keep the drives defragged to keep it all humming along."

I bought this software for my students recently, but after using it for a while and realising just how useful it is I've now bought my own copy for when composing at home.Basically it's got comprehensive information about almost every orchestral/band instrument you can think of (and a few you won't even have heard of) - but presented in a very useful & interesting way. There are pictures, orchestral & band layouts, instrumental ranges, notated examples from well-known pieces, historical context, plus (most importantly of all) hundreds of excellent audio recordings.What's more there's complete information about every possible technique, from bowing to multiphonics to percussion mallets, again all with recordings. This is completely invaluable even for a professional composer. Where else (in one place) can you actually *hear* the difference between jete and spiccato, or a cup mute and a Harmon mute? (Or a fingered trill and a lip-trill!) The orchestration books naturally *mention* all these things, but don't of course come with recordings!There's also a quiz, intended for students I suppose, to test what they've learnt - I tried it out (at the advanced level) and I confess not even I got full marks! (Some of those questions are really tricky...)Overall, I'd say this is invaluable both as an approachable introduction to instruments for students (even beginners), and as excellent reference material for professionals.(Disclaimer: I do already use their Sibelius 2 notation software, of which I'm a big fan, so I'm already a bit of a convert.

34236,1,"Overall I think this product is a great idea. I really wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this. It's not a substitute for a guide like Lonely Planet and it's not a DVD video as it only works on a computer. There is general text explaining each of the places to visit but no really practical stuff about hotels and transports. It is however a really cool thing to play with and was a great help in preparing our upcoming trip to New Zealand. The interactive photos are really incredible especially in full screen mode. They were beautifully shot, sharp and colorful. You can turn around with the mouse and look up and down. Many of them also have sound which really adds to the feeling of being there. The interactive maps were really easy to use and contained pretty much all the highlights of both islands. We got a much better sense with this software of what there was to see than with a guidebook. The kids also loved playing with it and got them really excited about our trip which was a great bonus."

16720,0,"When I reviewed McAfee VirusScan 8.0, I only gave the program a rating of 2-stars. I've increased the rating this time around to 3-stars, but only because in hindsight I think I was too harsh on McAfee regarding what I consider to be blatant advertising, otherwise known as McAfee SecurityCenter.I'll talk more about that in a little bit, but first let's review the actual virus scanning ability.McAfee VirusScan 9.0 is, essentially, the same program as the previous version. The only real difference is the scanning engine that operates the program, which is a behind-the-scenes item. Other than that, the only changes are cosmetic in nature.As with the previous version, VirusScan 9.0 is relatively easy to install. I say relatively easy because before you can install the program, you need to uninstall any previous VirusScan versions as well as follow the ""pre-install"" instructions that come with it. (WARNING: I also recommend that you uninstall ALL McAfee products on your computer before trying to install any VirusScan version. VirusScan is notorious about causing conflicts if you do not perform what they call a ""clean"" install.)Despite following the above advice, I installed, updated, and adjusted the settings in less than 10 minutes. I experienced no problems with the set up, or with conducting several test scans.In version 8.0, McAfee condensed not only the number of settings to adjust, but also the number of levels you had to navigate in order to get to all of the settings. The company also introduced their ""virus map"" feature, which allows you to, if you wish to participate, anonymously send virus information to the map system. The virus map also allows you to track viruses around the world. Wisely, McAfee left these options alone.One area I wish McAfee had made a change to is how the program ""updates"" itself. I prefer to have the program tell me when an update is available to download (I've never really been comfortable in allowing any program to automatically download an update). Unfortunately, this requires me to physically log-in to McAfee's Website each and everytime there is an update. Thankfully, I participate in Microsoft's Passport program, so logging in only requires a click of a button. But I still think you should be able to program your McAfee username and password into Security Center. In addition, the time required to download an update is still substantially more than it was back in version 7.0. Luckily, I now have a DSL connection so the time requirement isn't that bad. But if you still have a dial-up connection, be prepared for what can be substantial update times.In all the years I have used McAfee VirusScan, I have never once had a virus or trojan horse successfully download or install on my computer. I give the virus scanning ability of McAfee a 5-star rating.So why the overall reduced rating? There are three reasons for it.REASON 1: For some reason, McAfee can't help themselves when it comes to screwing up either VirusScan or Security Center during updates. In each of the last four years, McAfee has issued an update that caused severe problems for its users. During version 7.0, it was the introduction of Security Center through an update that caused many computers, mine included, to lose the ability to connect to our ISPs. During version 8.0, a Security Center update created a boot-up problem that caused many computers, again mine included, to frequently be unable to start VirusScan. I'm hoping this will be the year that McAfee can avoid screwing up our computers during the udpates, but I won't hold my breath.REASON 2: McAfee's customer service is one of the worst in any industry. Their live instant messaging help is a joke. The people who run this don't listen to your problem at all. They are only trained to have you run through a series of steps. Last year my then ISP made a change in how users connected to the Internet that caused a conflict with VirusScan. My ISP knew exactly how to fix this, but I needed to get one piece of information from McAfee. Their customer service people refused to listen to me when I tried to explain to them what I needed. When I refused to follow their ""remedy"" instructions, they would disconnect from the conversation. In an effort to get an answer, I finally capitulated and followed their instructions. Big mistake. Their instructions so screwed up my computer that I had to reinstall my operating system, as well as pay money to talk to McAfee on the phone (even then, it took three weeks and 5 different people before I got my answer).REASON 3: I still do not like the blatant advertising that is called Security Center. I know this is not a big deal to many people, but it just really bugs me. The taskbar icon that is installed is not what bothers me (I actually like this feature, because I don't have to add desktop icons for each McAfee program; instead, the Security Center taskbar icon keeps everything in one, easily accessible place). What really bothers me is the Security Center splash screen (which cannot be disabled) that pops up every time you start, or restart, your computer. This splash screen is oh-so-nice in telling you whether or not you have also installed McAfee's Firewall Plus, Privacy Service, and SpamKiller. Having to see this everytime I start my computer makes me feel like I paid good money to install a pop-up advertisement.Let me condense all of the above into the following: The underlying scanning engine is about the only real change in McAfee VirusScan 9.0 (although, this version does appear to fix a couple of bugs that were introduced through the previous version's updates). The Virus Map is still neat, the update feature is still time consuming, and Security Center is still basically a McAfee adversting tool.Bottom line: If the updates during version 8.0 are causing you problems, then go ahead and buy this version. Otherwise, it won't hurt to wait for version 10 before you upgrade."
50842,0,"More than 2 years ago a small company named PowerQuest developed a marvelous product called Partition Magic that let you resize partitions on the fly and other wonderful things and even launched nemerous patents to protect their development it was so innnovative. Even Microsoft realised the importance and partition resizing is being incorporated into Vista. Sadly everything changed when a grey monolithic multinational corporation called Symantec bought the company.Symantec bought PowerQuest for it's award winning backup software, now Norton Ghost 10. They got Partition Magic too but since then all development on the program has ceased, it hasn't been updated since 2004, and they give every indication of being utterly uninterested in this product and it's a tragedy.PM will only install on a FAT32 partition - if you have XP on NTFS then you're wasting your time with this.

44977,1,"I reluctantly purchased Retrospect Professional 7.5 because I could find no other product with the feature set I wanted. My previous experience with Restrospect Express HD was horrible, so this took a big (or dumb) leap of faith. The bottom line is that this is a powerful product that takes a serious commitment to learn how to use. I read through the nearly 400 page manual three times before I had any real idea of how to use the product effectively. That said, I like the product's flexibility and its incremental backups. So far I have had no crashes, but I was able to restore a crashed coomputer with Retrospect Express without much difficulty (there were other [non]usability issues with that product).Since a reliable incremental backup is what I was looking for, and I think am getting it with Retrospect Professional 7.5, I give the product a tentative 4 stars.

44326,1,"While Office 2003 offered a refreshed look and some improvements in functionality, the basic structure remained the same. While veteran users were able to easily navigate the familiar menus, it had become increasingly difficult to locate some features (for instance, in Word, would you find ""insert new rows"" to a table in the ""insert"" or ""table"" menu?).With Office 2007, Microsoft offers the ""ribbon"", a new and more intuitive way to access features that we used to find in the menus. While the features are basically the same, they are now grouped together according to when and how you would normally use them. These groupings are accessed by clicking on tabs, which are organized in the order you'd use them. The best way to get a better understanding of this change is to check out the screenshots, or download a free trial version of Office from Microsoft. While Office 2007 was released at the same time as Vista, you do not need Vista in order to run it. The program ran fine on my Windows XP laptop, which only had 512 MB of RAM, and it runs even better on my Vista laptop with 2 GB of RAM.As for which version of Office to buy, this is the third time I've opted for the Home and Student version (which has had other names in previous releases, but is still being sold for $149). I need Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, and this is the most cost-effective way to get those programs. I was disappointed that Microsoft dropped Outlook from the Home and Student version. In order to continue to use Outlook, I installed Outlook 2003 and haven't had any problems.Instead of Outlook, you get OneNote, a program that uses notebooks and tabs to save and organize all sorts of files and documents. I haven't had much time to play with OneNote yet, but the more I use it, the more impressed I am with it. It looks like one of those programs that you can personalize to meet your own needs and not have to fight with it to get it to do what you want.This is a significant upgrade and should allow all users, new and experienced, to work more efficiently and quickly."

50528,1,"Play baseball in the comfort of your own home. There's no shortage of baseball games for the PC especially with Humongous Entertainment's addition to the Backyard Sports series. Continuing the same tradition found in its other Backyard Sports games, you are the coach and you have the choice of choosing your own players including pros like Ivan Rodriguez, former Ranger Juan Gonzalez, and unbeatable Randy Johnson to name a few. Only in this game, they're kids! Backyard Baseball provides a wealth of options that are adaptable to your skill level and preferences.I brought in a pricey, 6-year old consultant to test the product. It took a little time to get set up and going, but once we had everything figured out we knew our way around the field of dreams, a basic neighborhood field or you can move up to bigger and fancier fields. The game was set on the easy level that allowed her to hit every pitch at which she swung. After she finished her game (her team, the Rangers, lost and it was no surprise), I changed the level to medium and it was very tough to hit the ball. Time passed and the adults got the hang of it.Later, the dad got hooked on the game -- so it's great for adults, too. Not only do you get pro ballers, you get regular kids with personality including a clumsy girl and a rock n' rollin' boy who do their shtick while at bat or on the field. This makes the game more entertaining and a bonus is that you can play other players and get software bug fixes while connected to the Internet.The only thing I wish it had was the ability to create team names from scratch instead of limiting the coach to stock names. Other than that, the game is batting 1.000."
22168,1,"A couple of years ago I inheritied the task of producing video of public meetings for a local government. My normal way of learning something new is to gather all the available programs and tinker with each and decide which does the job for me.As a result I've used high end products like Adobe Premier 2, and Sony Vegas. I hae also used Pinnacle Studio 9 and 10, as well as Cyberlink Power Director 4 and 5.For almost all your home and small business editing needs Power Director gets the job done with, at least in my experience, the smallest learning curve.Here are some importants points. All of these products are memory and speed intense. You will be disappointed with the results if you have less than 1 gigabyte of memory and a video card with less than 128 and preferably 256 meg of memory.If you are capturing from multiple devices in addition to a digital video camera I got the best results from a Canopus ADVC-110 digital video converter box. This box connects to your computer via a Firewire/1394 connector. I used various Pinnacle devices all with no better than minimaly satisfactory results. In additon Pinnacle capture hardware often only works with Pinnacle software. The Canopus box gives me good quality conversion and few dropped frames.Power Director's manual is bearly adequate and there is not much in the way of third party books or manuals. But, the program is relatively simple to use and quite powerful.The program enables you to import and edit video, add titles, transitions, voice-overs, and then generate output to either digital tape, dvd, or video cd disks. With the Canopus converter you can also take digital output and write it back to an analog VHS cassette tape. Version 5 includes some really neat sound and video enahncement tools that will help you clean up color that needs enhancement or sound that could use some cleaning up.Finaly one word of caution. If you have a computer with Windows XP and you are updating it by adding Service Pack 2, be mindful of one potential glitch. I don't know if Microsoft corrected this, but the installation upgrade to SP2 changed your Fireware 1395 port to it's slowest possible speed which is too slow to capture video. As a result a machine that was capturing video without problems suddenly experienced dropped frames. When installing SP2 go to the Microsoft website for an update that corrects the problem.I like PowerDirector 4 and 5 better than Pinnacle Studio only because for me it was simpler to learn and get up and running. Studio is not a bad program, but in my experience slower (especially ver 10) and a tad more complex.Good Luck!"
36942,1,"I bought this product for my wife to use to start the design of our new home. She's a regular computer user, but no kind of geek and is frequently confused by software features and functions.Nevertheless, she's spent hours enjoying the process of designing our house using the software. Room layouts and adding furniture have been a breeze. The software has given us a very good picture of how big the rooms need to be and how the furniture will fit.She's had some trouble figuring out mutliple floors. When she added the basement and then switched to a 3D view, the house was shoved sideways off the basement. We never figured that out. Adding stairs to the second floor is another function that she also hasn't quite figured out.But overall we are enormously pleased with the software. It gives us plenty of design power without overwhelming us with complexity."
6706,1,This is a great game which my son(7) really enjoyed playing over and over again. It has four different versions to keep the child interested in playing. I found that feature awesome.[...].

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! Support sucks all around and there appears to be no fix now or in the near future to get software working...I lost $100 bucks on this one!!!"
72200,1,I homeschool my child and use this for her 7th grade typing class. She is doing really well and likes the product. It's easy to use and works with Vista. She was using the Typing Instructor for Kids until she had to get a new laptop. It wouldn't install on her new computer so we had to purchase a new one. She liked the other one too but this one is more for the older kids. I'd give it an A.
57496,1,"Trend Micro is not the first name most people think of when they look for a home Internet security suite. Best known for its enterprise-level applications, the company has branched out to serve the security needs of the average PC user.Carrying Trend Micro's hopes for tapping in to that market is the PC-cillin application. The latest version, Internet Security 2006, offers all-in-one security at a budget price.Because the company has designed the package to work with just about every Windows operating system, even systems built in the mid-1990s, most machines will meet the minimum requirements easily and will not be bogged down with a resource-hungry application.Installation is simple. Once loaded, the program runs itself. All features can be turned on or off and functions such as automatic updates are accessible through a well-organized central interface. Like most makers of security programs, Trend Micro followed the ""install and forget"" theme, making it easy for users to forget the application is there.Compared to the 2005 version, PC-cillin 2006 does not offer too many new bells and whistles. Instead, Trend Micro tried to improve on existing features. The application stands guard against viruses, spyware, spam, and phishing schemes. It includes a firewall as well as controls that allow parents to block Web sites that contain inappropriate content.PC-cillin also contains a Wi-Fi intrusion-detection feature, which adds an extra layer of security to wireless home networks by alerting you when an intruder uses your Wi-Fi connection.Like other security programs on the market, automatic updates are available to keep the software's virus definitions up to date.Overall, the application's basic functions work very well. The antivirus component and firewall will catch the intrusions you worry about. However, advanced users who like to tweak all elements of their firewall and security programs might be somewhat dismayed by the limited configuration options.And the Wi-Fi feature, however helpful, cannot protect all aspects of your network, so you might be better off sticking with your router's built-in firewall for home-network protection.But given the program's price and extremely low system requirements, shoppers on the market for a lower-cost security suite will be well served by the application.Trend Micro PC-cillin Internet Security 2006Pros: Good price, low system requirements, wide array of protections.Cons: Not as feature rich as other security suites on the market.Rating: 5 out of 5Verdict: Overall, the application's basic functions work very well. The antivirus component and firewall will catch the intrusions you worry about. However, advanced users who like to tweak all elements of their firewall and security programs might be somewhat dismayed by the limited configuration options. But given the program's price and extremely low system requirements, shoppers on the market for a lower-cost security suite will be well served by the application."

It's easy but strangely fun many times over and over again. I'd say it's a top 5 software game to have. Works on most computers, But if you have a new one-get a newer game. I almost prefer this more than the 4th-so much more simplier and actually more fun. you choice"

When I contacted Tech Support, I was informed they only work with Outlook Express and cannot help me. Unfortunately, there is no return policy for software."

I was a little concerned about ordering after reading a few of the reviews with their problems but now I realize they were probably the operators fault,ie: 1)does not always record a line on the graph when you sing.....make sure the earphone/mouthpiece plugs are all the way plugged into the computer,etc. I do agree that a few more pieces of music would have been nice but overall, it has a lot of options to try different things.

46182,1,"I purchased Photoshop Elements when I was hired by my father to create a presentation about his recent trip to Vietnam. I found that it did an exceptional job for what we needed for that project (mainly just simple color/brightness/contrast corrections, and cropping,) but, once I got to trying to use it for my own purposes, such as complex original creations needing features such as guides or advanced layer transparencies, it fell way short of what I needed. The bottom line here is that Elements is for the person who wants to do photo touch-ups and simple effects (like embossing and liquifying, etc,) but certainly isn't powerful enough for a creative professional."
61684,1,I use this program over my Norton Speed Disc and WinXP defragger. It is faster and seems more accurate. I did try to install Disckeeper 8 on my Laptop running WinXP Media edition but got a box saying it is not approved for this and it would not download. The previous version seems to work okay with Media however.
17450,1,"I am a serious amateur photographer, that recently purchased a film scanner. I quickly realized that calibrating my monitor was required as the first step in making accurate color corrected scans of my slides. This express version worked easily, was easy to install, and worked as advertised. I do not regret my purchase. It creates a fixed named ICC profile for the computer that it is installed on. I was pleased that I purchased it, happy with the calibration results for my purposes. I'm sure a hard core production house would prefer a more sophisticated device. I saw a definate change and more vivid colors after calibration. My setup is a laptop in a docking station. I wanted to have an ICC profile for the laptop screen, and a different one for the docked and connected flatscreen monitor. If you have this situation, or if you run a dual monitor computer you will need the PRO version to support making two differently named ICC profiles. There is a workaround however. One cannot simply copy and rename an ICC profile that is produced because it contains internal settings too. But the workaround is to download from Msft the COLOR manager addin for XP. I made a copy of the profile created by Spyder express, renamed it. opened it in COLOR manager and internally rename the profile. After a little tinking, re running the calibration process and using the MSft COLOR manager app, I was able to crate two ICC profiles, one for my monitor, one for my laptop screen. It would have been easier to simply purchase the PRO version of this program. Overall, for my purposes, I was pleased."
71405,1,I have been a Pinnacle Studio 7 user for a number of years and up-graded to the 10 version. Big mistake. What a total waste. I liked Studio 7 for its user-friendlyness.. You can trust a name like Adobe. I've only used it on a couple of small projects and the capabilities are powerful. Harder to use but it does what its suppose to do. I would recommend it highly.
12029,1,"While Windows XP is viewd by many as a great operating system, there are several flaws, but the average consumer will probably never notice. If you're planning on upgrading to XP, you should really make sure you have at least 256mb of RAM, 512mb is even better. XP is resourse hungry and really needs more RAM than Microsoft states in order for it to run smoothly and eliminate crashes. It does require more processing power too, but this should not be a problem for most newer systems. I would however not recommend running it on anything less than a 1.0 gig machine."
70014,0,"""King of the Zombies"" is a 1941 zombie comedy from director Jean Yarborough set during World War II. James ""Mac"" McCarthy (Dick Purcell), his servant Jefferson ""Jeff"" Jackson (Mantan Moreland) and his pilot Bill Summers (John Archer) are in a small plane that gets blown off course. Picking up a radio signal they crash on an unknown island (there is no money for special effects so the three throw up their arms in front of their faces before a quick fade out to represent the crash). There they are welcome in an appropriately strange manner by Dr. Mikhail Sangre (Henry Victor). Making things even stranger is Momba (Leigh Whipper), the butler, Samantha (Marguerite Whitten), the maid, and Tahama (Madame Sul-Te-Wan), who is not only Sangre's cook but the local High Priestess.Yes, there are zombies walking around in this one, but Dr. Sangre is also into hypnotism and one of the strangest mad scientist experiments for getting secret information from a person you have ever seen in a B-movie. You see, it turns out there is also a missing admiral, a damsel who may be in distress, and strict rules about how much salt a zombie can have in their diet. As others have noted, the best part of this movie is Mantan Moreland, who walks a fine line as the comedy relief in this movie. Granted, he is conforming to the stereotype of the black servant, but he manages to avoid playing his fright an anything close to a Stepin' Fetchit caricature. If only the white characters would listen to him they would not have problems like having a pistol full of bullets pumped into their bodies while walking around like zombies.Believe it or not, ""King of the Zombies"" received an Academy Award nomination for Edward J. Kay for Best Musical Score of a Dramatic Picture (there were 20 film scores nominated that year, including the ones for ""Citizen Kane,"" ""How Green Was My Valley,"" ""Suspicion,"" and ""Sergeant York,"" with Bernard Hermann winning for ""The Devil and Daniel Webster""). Bela Lugosi was apparently supposed to play Dr. Sangre, but that would have been a minimal improvement and really would have worked against Moreland's comedy.""Revolt of the Zombies"" is a 1936 film from director Victor Halperin (who made ""White Zombie"" four years earlier) that actually is set during World War I when a priest (Teru Shimada) from French Cambodia insists his god requires him to raise a zombie army to fight the Germans in the trenches. The allied generals are impressed by the idea and want the secret of creating zombies but the priest refuses to share it and is murdered shortly after being imprisoned. So an expedition is sent to the fabled lost city of Angkor to find the secret, but the problem is that a love triangle breaks out between Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland), his fianc&eacute; Claire Duval (Dorothy Stone), and Armand Loque (Dean Jagger, young and with hair!). As the odd man out, Armond discovers the secret and instead of using it to stop the Huns from overrunning his homeland raises the zombies to make Claire his own.There is lot of scenes where actors walk in front of footage of Angkor and other exotic actions, but mostly there is a lot of talking in this one and giant zombie eyes superimposed over the action. But the real problem with ""Revolt of the Zombies"" is that it has this great idea of using zombie soldiers in war that gets forgotten once the love triangle becomes more important than the expedition, so you feel like you took a wrong turn someplace in this one. Then again, the whole idea that zombies are from Cambodia, where the Aspara figures, the heavenly dancers of Hindu mythology at Angkor Wat, are turned in zombies, is a step in the wrong direction. There is also some cloak and dagger nonsense that only complicates the increasingly bad situation.In terms of double-features movies for Saturday night viewing this one is really bare boned. You get the movies, one on each side of the DVD, and frames for the cast, filmmakers, and a couple of paragraphs on the history of the film from an actual film scholar. Of these two bad movies ""King of the Zombies"" is a shade better, but in the end neither of these zombie movies is really about real zombies (to wit, animated corpses raised from their graves) and that is the final disappointment. We will try for better lucky with out next set of offerings, ""The Killer Shrews"" and ""I Bury the Living."""

5054,2,"I have been using Symantec products for the 7 years that I've had PC's at home. Until recently I was running Antivirus 2003 Professional without a problem. Additionally, I downloaded Norton Antispam 2004 in April from the Symantec online store and was also running that software without incident. I found both Antivirus and Antispam to be solid software that functioned consistently.When my Antivirus 2003 Professional subscription expired a couple of weeks ago, I decided to upgrade to Antivirus 2004 Professional, rather than simply purchasing another subscription for a year to Antivirus 2003 Professional, as the upgraded software had a couple of new features in which I was interested.BIG MISTAKE! I have never been able to completely install and run Antivirus 2004 Professional and, in addition to that, Antispam 2004 was corrupted in the process and no longer functions properly. I have spent nearly 10 hours (including time on 2 extended phone calls with Symantec tech. support), gone through pages and pages of online documentation, and attempted everything that was recommended to me, including editing the system registry. All of this has been to absolutely no avail and tech. support still cannot pinpoint the incompatability issue.Antivirus 2004 Professional will still not install, Antivirus 2003 Professional (originally on the system) had to be completely removed and deleted (and, since it was downloaded last year from the Symantec Store, is now gone forever) and Antispam 2004 simply will no longer work. (At one point in a conversation with a tech. support representative, he actually had the audacity to suggest that I install a log file which will monitor my keystokes and then upload the file to Symantec so that their analysts can try to determine the cause of the problem.)To add to the gall of all of this (which includes many hours of my time on what should have been a 10-minute installation and now having a system with neither Antispam nor Antivirus running on it), I am now fighting with Symantec's online store to refund the money I paid on April 21, 2004 for Antispam because it is beyond their 60-day return policy (despite the fact that it was their own product - Antivirus 2004 Professional - that corrupted Antispam and made it unuseable).Needeless to say, Symantec has lost a former customer of 7 years and tomorrow morning I'll be out shopping for McAfee products.Symantec should not be selling software products with so many known compatability issues, a fact of which I was unaware until after I attempted installation.Stay aware from this product at all costs! I would go so far as to say stay away from ALL Symantec products, given the inability of their tech. support respresentatives to resolve issues, as well as their customer service representative's inability to satisfy customers who have issues that are a direct result of their own software's failures."
20426,1,"I read a lot of computer books, and normally they are about as exciting as watching paint dry. I can't claim this book is exciting, but it does everything it possibly can to ease the pain.The author is obviously a professional writer, not a computer guy who knows stuff and is writing a book about it. The structure of the book is impeccable and extremely consistent. Each section has a description and then extremely well written walk throughs. This allows people with different learning styles to access the book differently. I'm a very experiential learner, so I might do the walk through first and then read about what I did, others may like to do it differently.I have really enjoyed learning and growing in excel. At the time of reading this book I was progressively working on a real world spreadsheet. At the end of many chapters I would think &quot;hey, what a cool feature, I could use it to improve my spreadsheet&quot;. As I spend a lot of time in this spreadsheet, this book has saved me lots of time by allowing me to streamline my work.Curtis, write more books please - the computer world needs authors like you!"

After running for a few weeks, things started to get slower to the point where you weren't sure if you clicked on it so you wind up opening it five times. I trace the problem to GoBack. First I thought it was a virus because I compared the Processes in Task Manager to a backup computer. All the items were running at 10x the memory usage. I got the nerve to just uninstall it and notice a dramatic speed increase. Fortunately I had a printscreen of pre and post uninstall. Rundll32.exe was 35, 956 before and 5,264 after. Even it's own programs like Navapsvc.exe was at 36,292 before and 1,032 after. I don't think Norton is a resource hog just that they need to fix GoBack. BEWARE of the junker program."
6915,1,"HelloMy name is Bruno Levy and I co-authored this cd-rom with life long friend Emile Servan-Schreiber.(I apologize for self rating this cd with 5 stars but it looks like the amazon software force me to give a rating.)Our idea in designing and producing this cd-rom was to give an introductory (and interactive) overview about what is currently known on the brain and the mind. One of the big revolution of the 90s is that the knowledge of how the mind works(the goal of cognitive psychology) starts to be in close correspondance with the knowledge of how the brain work s(the goal of neuroscience).That's why we interviewed some of the best specialists in both domain and asked them to explain in the simplest language what they have discovered and understood about the brain and the mind in their research.In addition, we have included a serie of first person interactive experiments. All these experiments have been designed and discovered by cognitive psychologists in the last 25 years. A lot of them are extremely entertaining but not very well known by the general public. When we designed our cd-rom, we thought it would be interesting to have people discover **on themselves** the mechanism of their own mind at work. Its a great way to understand that cognitive psychology is really a science able to made predictions (A word of caution: these experiments are NOT IQ test.)Our cd-rom was published two years ago in France and Italy and has been a great success: we sold 25000 units in France and 25000 more in Italy. We received several prestigious award in France for both its content and interactivity.I honestly believe that the cd-rom is still actual in terms of content. I also want to say that all the cd is illustrated by French Artist Philippe Andrieu who has really provided a welcomed and appropriate poetic touch to this whole subject.Here is a list of the people whose interviews are reproduced in the cd-rom:- Herbert Simon (Nobel prize of economics and one of the founder of AI &amp; cognitive psychology). - Eric Kandel (He just received the Nobel Prize in medecine this year).In the cd he explained a part of the work he has received his Nobel for. - Daniel Schacter from Harvard. He will speak about how memory are formed. - Stephen Kosslyn from Harvard, he will speak about vision and imagination. - John Anderson from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), he will speak about the rule of thoughts. - Rodney Brooks from MIT, he will describe his attenpt to build a humanod robot (COG). - James McClelland from CMU, he will explain how neurones work and communicate together to produce mental thoughts (neural nets). _ Michale Posner form Oregon U, he will describe the mechanisms of attention. - Jean Pierre Changeux from Pasteur Institut, he will describe how the brain grows. - David Servan Schreiber from U of Pittsburgh, he will speak about the emotional brain - Rodolfo Llinas from NYU who will introduce us to some of the brain mechanisms underlying consciousness.I hope this description helps.Bruno Levy"

I have even used ""Speed Spanish"" by National Dynamics, which is a good program too, but not as good as Rosetta Stone. You do learn how to conjugate in the present, past and future. You learn tons of vocabulary words and yes, you learn some conversational skills too. However, it is complete up to you to leave your comfort zone and practice it in the real world. I use it every day with other employees in my office that are fluent in Spanish.

When I load new pictures from my camera, I can page through each one very quickly. It displays each image in well under a second - even on my old computer! It is so much easier to view and find the pictures I want now, and I never thought I'd see this kind of performance without buying a new, faster computer.It also comes with a simple photo editor. I mostly just use the standard ""fix it"" feature on it. It adjusts the pictures very well to fix any exposure, color or lighting problems - much better than the Adobe Photodeluxe that came with my digital camera.I had no problem at all with installation or use, so I never had to call for customer support."

11412,0,"EDIT: Okay, I'd like to humbly retract my previous review of Lightroom. I just bought a Canon 5D, and am only shooting with it in RAW. I pretty much immediately realized what an asset this program is going to be. It loads the photos incredibly quickly, displays them beautifully (you can make impromptu slideshows that look incredibly professional), allows you to filter through them (using flags, stars, keywords, etc), etc. etc. Now, to be fair, I will definitely be using Photoshop (especially a newer version...CS3 or 4) still. However, Lightroom is an entirely different program that really should not be considered in the same genre.Technically, you probably don't 'need' this program if you're a photographer. Canon's more recent software includes a RAW viewer that handily converts files into JPG's, and the interface isn't terrible. However, I personally am glad I bought this (and even more glad I returned to it). It's a professional program that understands what photographers want.END EDITFirst of all, if you KNOW you want to buy this, check [...] first (if you're a student/academic) to see if you can apply for the discount (it only cost me $98 there).That having been said, as a user of Photoshop CS, I wasn't too pleased with the program. I feel like the adjustments you can make in Lightroom seem elementary compared to the comprehensive array of instruments you can use in Photoshop. However, Lightroom doesn't claim to be as good as Photoshop, so I suppose I shouldn't berate it for this.The interface of Lightroom is beautiful in comparison to Photoshop...but I still haven't gotten used to the crazy ""import"" function. It seems very counterintuitive to me that you can import a file, heavily edit the file, and yet not have it on your computer. Perhaps I just need to spend more time with the program.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with Photoshop. Photoshop is a beast! Lightroom seems more for the layperson who doesn't want to deal with the more complicated interface/controls of Photoshop.I'm not saying that there aren't people out there who wouldn't pledge their lives to this program. Perhaps you're one of those who will find this to be a great investment. That having been said, I would recommend against it. For $300, go buy yourself a version of Photoshop."
20213,1,"Picture It Publishing has been a great tool to develop cards, flyers, posters and general photo editing. It is easy to use and has an adequate amount of clips and effects to keep a novice happy (it is a lot easier than Photoshop when it comes to home publishing). I would recommend it, it has a few kinks but nothing unsurmountably wrong, and I've been pleased with the results."
900,1,"I downloaded SuSE Linux 9.3 from a SuSE mirror and installed it this past week. I have worked with a lot of Linux distributions in the past, most recently Mandrake 10.1. Linux has always been very promising but also always somewhat difficult to make work well - it was definitely an OS for the hobbyist who enjoyed struggling with it to get things to work. SuSE Linux 9.3 changes all that. I have dubbed it the ""it just works"" Linux distro. EVERYTHING I have tried simply works. Printers, webcams, external hard drives, USB memory sticks... EVERYTHING simply works, no muss, no fuss. It is a truly amazing experience. In addition to its excellent hardware support, SuSE Linux 9.3 comes with a dazzling array of excellent software. I have not found it to be wanting anything that I was looking for, and have run into all sorts of excellent new software as well. This is the Linux I have been looking for. SuSE Linux 9.3 is so good that even though I have downloaded and installed it for free, I have purchased the boxed set. These guys deserve to be compensated for the excellent job they have done. If you are looking for a solid, stable, ""it just works"" Linux distro, SuSE Linux 9.3 is the Linux for you."
52650,0,"Everything was going perfectly until I tried to e-file my NY State tax return. For some unknown reason, form IT-213-ATT (for people with six or more children under age 17) isn't included in the Taxcut program (even after I updated) and now I can't e-file. Since the price of the program includes a state e-file, I should be refunded by H&R; Block for their error of not including this form. Off to speak to the customer reps...Update - the first rep said she'd look into it. No answer for a week. I called again and this time got a knowledgeable and VERY helpful rep. She looked into it while I remained on the phone and ended up telling me that I should send back the CD for a refund. Let's see what happens from here...Update #1 - My refund was rejected because they only allow refunds for the first sixty days after purchase. However, this was not for dissatisfaction, it is for a form that wasn't included in the program. In my opinion, that is negligence and I was sold a product that included a state e-file (which I paid extra for) that was faulty. Back to the phone...Update #2 - They agreed with me! After ""an internal review"", they're sending me a check for $15...the price of an e-file."
84167,1,"*This is the UPGRADE edition, not the FULL edition*We should cover a few things about the editions before we review Vista. ""Starter"" is very basic and limited to 256MB of memory. Almost everything good about Vista is omitted. ""Home Basic"" does not have the Aero graphics flip windows special effects. ""Home Premium"" has limited networking interaction. ""Vista Business"" has the extended networking interaction. ""Vista Enterprise"" has UNIX and Virtual machine support. ""Ultimate"" has all the bells and whistles. Carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchase.Installing Vista is very easy. This can be easily demonstrated by giving a child the DVD and a blank computer and saying ""install that"". Come back 5 minutes later and play with Vista. Checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must. ""Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor"" will identify the changes needed. Many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates pre-install patch before a Vista upgrade. A Vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible. Depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade, a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after. The install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and Vista is up and running. This might not be so simple if Vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like VMware which requires additional configurations of the BIOS and some other tweaks. We have come a long way since the days of Windows 3.1 insert disc #10. The first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which Vista launches. This is most certainly Microsoft's fastest OS to date. As soon as Vista loads up, low and behold the ""gadgets"" display appears on the desktop with moving pictures, CPU meter, real-time news feeds, real-time weather, clock, notes, stock exchange, calendar and contacts. WOW, impressive stuff... but let's stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is... gadgets is just Apple OSX's ""widgets"" ripped-off (some might say that widgets existed before as separate plug-ins from Yahoo called ""Konfabulator"", but we are talking about this being inherently part of the OS, not plug-ins). It is an Apple invention that is in demand, much like the need for a desktop recycle bin (which Apple didn't patent, doh!). Microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of Apple's innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it. Truth-be-told, in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone else's stuff for free, Microsoft are even in on the game, and making money of it. However this is all about competition. Since the competition exists (and we may have some things to say about MS and monopoly) we should be thankful that other forces are driving MS to do what it may not have done without these pressures. Who really cares if Vista is ultimately an Apple OSX rip? This is what Microsoft has always been about. At the same time Apple has openly accepted a Command Line Interface, MS right-click save as or open as and Intel chips. Balance things out. If you don't like Microsoft, then you know where to go. Third party software will probably sway you one way or another. However seeing OSx86 boot on VMware on top of Vista is something that makes you stop and think. Linux users simply front `customization' as the bonus to not going with Windows and in many ways they have a big point to make. Vista has the same lockdown Start Menu system. You just can't change it or put any folder anywhere you want. In a way this creates a standard (""Where does Johnny keep his documents on this system?"" ""Oh yeah, the documents folder!""), while at the same time professional users just want to custom the Start menu the way they like it, but can't. Microsoft hasn't really got a whole pile of originality going on here (although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the Ultimate pack) and for all intents and purposes Vista is OSX.Vista is great. Its fast, fast, fast on a 3Ghz Pentium 4 or 1.66Ghz Core Duo. 1GB of ram will run it no problem. The first thing to do is to open a pile of windows, hold down the windows start key + tab, press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip 3D windows (the new Aero system). Also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it. That is very impressive. No longer are we pinned down to one desktop. Just scrolling through multiple Windows in 3D is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny. Vista also looks a whole world better than XP and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look. Vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this. Apart from that, Windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows, some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath. This is a whole new art dimension that Windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make. Installing Office 2007 just brings it all to life, but that is another story.99% of XP software will run on Vista. The only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices. It seems Vista security (although Vista has been cracked already) is trying to prevent people from loading up an ISO on software like Daemon Tools. No doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one. 70Gigs worth of software running on XP here has installed no problem on Vista... and no BSOD (blue screens of death) or serious flaw seems apparent. While some software did not like the way it was installed, using Windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues. For something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this is.XP users will complain that they have only just learned XP and see no reason why they need Vista. Right now nobody `needs' Vista. However Microsoft has indicated that some games (especially Xbox ports like Halo 2) and software will only be Vista compatible. If you like OSs and like what is cutting edge then don't hold back a moment longer and get it. If you need a system that is absolutely solid, then try out Vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see. You might be inclined to wait for Vista SP1 but to be honest I see no reason why most people can not use this, right out of box, right now. Like I said, I have ported my XP software over and Vista is just as stable... surprise!... well not really. Since Win2K, Microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and Apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is. The very existence of OSx86 proves this. Vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it. This is going to be the future of Windows OSs for the next few years. The last time Windows released an OS was around the time of 911. It has been 6 years, the longest gap between Microsoft OSs in history, and it is worth the wait, especially imagining what Vista SP2 will deliver on. Many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though. Why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way? Bring on the multi-user touch-screen PC and give us a real show! Don't you think we all deserve it? We do.The bottom line here is that this is stable future-tech. If that makes your eyes go bing then don't hold back a second more and just get this thing. You will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new OS once again."
74737,1,"I've been a user of Norton Utility Speedisk longer than some of you have been alive. I manage the IT department of a company that has laptop users that can't be away from their computers long enough for me to defrag them, so I thought I'd try Diskeeper because it defrags in the background.Yes, the initial manual defragmentation is slower than Norton...BUT, it defragmented the drive on my laptop to 0.1% fragmentation, while Norton Speedisk never got below around 3%. Add to that the fact that I didn't have to exit out of any processes running in the background.After doing the initial defragmentation, I set the Diskeeper to &quot;Set it and forget it&quot; and it works in the background. I don't notice any performance loss (running on Windows XP Pro). I'm using an eval copy (available from the company's web site) but I've ordered a 5-pack for my users."

70905,1,"My seven year old twins sons can't get enough of this game.The game has two modes: solving a series of progressively harder puzzles, and free play where you build your own machines from scratch. They made it through the first couple dozen puzzles but when the puzzles started involving electric circuits, the boys couldn't solve them. I imagine they will be able to solve all the puzzles when they are a bit older.For now, the part that captivates them is the free play; they love coming up with wild machines that toss balls around, launch fireworks, etc. I can't count how many times I've been excitedly called into their room to review their latest creation."
83796,1,"This is a good starter guide for the do-it-yourselfer. While it's aimed at the web newbie, it's also an easy tool for more experienced web masters to use to easily get sites online. I'd also recommend ""The Complete Web Hosting Kit"" as a companion, because it gives you the software you need to actually host a web site on your home or office computer for free."
5778,0,"These types of programs should require entry of information only once. I had to enter my mortgage interest twice, dependent care expenses twice, and my final payment three times. I'm still not sure that it figured out our 403(b) plans correctly - it looks like we're getting hit for going, say, $5000 *over the limit* of $11,000 instead of just contributing $5000.However overall, it wasn't an awful experience - the program installed and ran fine, and when I compared the print output with last year's return prepared with TurboTax, the results were pretty consistent, including the 403(b) issue.I don't know what I'll use next year, though. Both programs have their drawbacks. If basic TT won't import last year's info, then the double entries in TaxCut may still be comparatively better."

52848,1,"The primary thing I would change about this program is the stupid cartoony interface and the constant need to hit ESC to forward through the little animations and movies. I also wish it came with a regular test booklet for the times when you want to get away from the computer.I used this product for the general GRE. I found the testing diagnostics helpful for developing a studying strategy, with which I was able to address my most serious weak points. I studied for about a month leading up to the GRE, and was very pleased with my score. The practice tests I took with this program gave me a really good sense of time and pace, and I was actually surprised when the real GRE ended at how much surplus energy I still had. Incidentally, I scored much better than the program had predicted I would, and likewise I found the practice questions slightly more difficult on the whole than the actual test.This is a good product for someone like me: a couple/few years out of college and eons since basic requirement classes, or someone who usually tests pretty well but who needs a crash refresher on standardized testing, or someone who is new to the computer-based test thing (I have a hard time thinking while looking at a screen). Caution though: I'd also recommend that this program be augmented with some good old book studying too, or you could be disappointed."
59434,1,"I got the original MKA video game, and I liked it except for the sound. I tried this one and the game play is about the same (very unique and fun, but not all that hard), the graphics are the same (OK but not that much detail), and the sound is the same (cool music from TV series but lousy MKA voices). My sister like it even more than I do, and she hates the twins and is practically an expert video gamer. It is a lot of fun, teaches you about teamwork, and is overall great (except voices). It is a lot like other MKA game, and you can find cheats and tips on their website. Plus free poster included. If you are looking for a clean, different game, this is the one."

With my 16-year-old son enabling our household to qualify for this software, I purchased it and have been extremely pleased! Microsoft continues to have a very solid, outstanding product in this latest release!My biggest objection previously to buying a newer version was the steep price for even an upgrade. This version, while not upgradeable, offers a license for three computers in the same household at a fraction of the normal upgrade cost. Everything is the same as the standard version -- the only difference is the license.If you've got at least one student in your home and you have multiple computers, this title is the way to go!"
18466,0,"I kind of like this game because you can decorate clothes, but it isn't really very fun. I don't understand why it's called beauty styler, because the only hairdoes you can give them are round curls, bangs, big curls, hair that looks like rope, and some more. The hair doesn't even look real. And you can't save very many pictures. And if you want to use the close up, and you want to color a shirt with the hair, you can't color the bottom that's not in the square.And if you keep undoing things, whenever you undo something all the old things will come back, then disappear, and if you got rid of a bunch of things, it will tke a long time for them all o come back then disappear."

But the quality of the software remains excellent, the upgrades are always worthwhile, and this is still the most user-friendly database I've ever used.Especially if you're an Access user (which is impossible software!), you will love the ease and versatility of this program."
29359,1,"If there's ever a game one can learn while playing, it's the Haunted Carousel. As a kid you ride the merry go round spying the nicest looking horse you hope to get when finally on the platform. This game offers so much information about the origin of the horses being built, seeing interior room where the internal workings of the mechanisms are that makes the carousel such an attraction. Learning about the music rolls and playing a game while riding it too is fun. Kids love amusement park entertainment and one can't go wrong with this action packed game. If you're an adult, you reminisce on those enjoyable memories while gaining clues and solving the crime."
57999,1,"The Curse of Blackmoor Manor was the first Nancy Drew game I had purchased, played, finished and thoroughly enjoyed. Nancy is called to the mysterious moors of England to check up on her old neighbor, Linda Petrov-Penvellyn who is ill under unusual circumstances. Shortly after moving into the ancient estate with her husband and step-daughter Jane, Linda came too close to a heavily veiled family secret, and now is suffering the consequences. Is she turning into the Blackmoor Beast, a werewolf-like creature rumored to have been created by Elinor Penvellyn, or is someone in the family up to no good?The graphics in this game are very good. The characters are quite animated, the castle is highly realistic and all the locations are unique and interesting. Even though this game was intended to be a really scary game, personally I felt that while the creepy element was definitely called upon, the game is not as scary as it appears on the cover. Also, many people have felt that this game is ""terrible"" or ""opposes Christianity"" because of the supernatural elements in the game, such as the curse of the werewolf and the secret rituals and, my favorite, Alvin's Ghost Hunt. I feel that the previous are needed in the game as they are an important part of the plot line and sometimes add humor. (Fun slide, anyone?) All I have to say is that those closed minded people are missing out on a great experience.Overall, I give this game 5 stars. The plot was original, the settings breathtaking and the supernatural elements quite refreshing. The puzzles are at first a bit daunting, but tie everything together perfectly. I would recommend this game to all Nancy Drew lovers of any age."
81518,1,"I have a 5 yr old and a 7 yr old who enjoy playing the game. The microphone is a big hit, and works well. Both my boys sang along at least five times when they got their first song on the jukebox. Listening to their voices made both of them really speak up, loud and clear. I was personally amazed that my 5 yr old spoke so clearly into the microphone. I feel the software was nicely made. By the fifth time they ask to complete the activity, I'm feeling like they are going to lose interest but they didnt, and my kids continued on."
7430,0,This package lack's two main features. It does not contain any help files and it does not compile. If I knew that it didn't contain help I would have never bought it. The package includes a basic introductory book which is not bad. Another book is included on the cd rom( this book is actually a more substantial one).If you have windows Xp I would strongly recommend to buy the vb.net standard.
57250,0,"I agree, this software is good. Great detail. The 3D feature is over-rated, though, for my uses. More of an image gimmick than actual representation of terrain. More importantly, though, my software suddenly &quot;lost&quot; one much-used quad sheet, leaving white space in it's place on my screen. I also lost all the markers and trails associated with that area, which included several day's work. Called their customer service for assistance and was connected to a very rude, arrogant, and unhelpful technician. Result: no fix. The company needs to back an excellent product with helpful and knowledgable technicians."

It is a great navagation tool, better than most online sites and can be used in the car.I marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the Lexington, Kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth, with new streets and roads.The software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map, so you don't have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night. Major points of interest are also on the map."
60913,1,"This program is a good value. In one box you receive 4 CD's. One is &quot;Talk Now,&quot; a second is &quot;World Talk&quot; (both from EuroTalk, and much more expensive when bought separately) The third CD is Webster's 5 language Dictionary. The fourth is Voyage in Italy, a travelogue with sights and sounds of Italy.The EuroTalk programs are very good values. As noted in other reviews, there is a big step between Talk Now and World Talk. I found the games useful teaching devices. The other disks are just gravy."
10312,0,"Basically, it's a collection of tactical problems from games where tactical mistakes occur at the opening stage or early in the middlegame. The games are classified by the ECO code.As you open a problem, the program plays the first moves; the you have to find the tactical blow enabled by the opening mistake.It's easy to guess how this collection was composed: the authors selected short decisive games (where one may suspect an early blunder was made) from the database. Then they selected the games suitable for excersizing in tactics (about 1200) and assigned difficulty levels. That's it.Interface: fair to poor. See my review on ""CT-ART 3.0"". I was told that the interface problems have been resolved with the new ""Peshk@"" interface, but I also heard the new interface has new problems that are worse than the old ones.Ratings: problems are waaaaay overrated, my estimate is USCF+350 or so. Not as bad as in CT-ART (I finished it with 2600 (sic!) rating) but still overrated.Despite all the negative stuff said, EOB is a very reasonable way of studying the typical tactical motives of you favorite openings. The rest of the pack is usable as tactical problems. Not bad at all.I would never buy it as a stand-alone product for Amazon sticker price of $39. But, if you are to buy a disk with 5 or so of their products bundled together for roughly the same price of $40 (as I did), then EOB is a useful addition."

Later, when I started using broadband, the software continued to work fine.I am currently selling my copy because this software is not supported on my Mac laptop with the Intel chip (which no longer runs ""Classic OS 9"" apps), nor on my Windows XP laptop. :-( Otherwise, I would have rated this a 5 star application, and I miss running it on my computers."

28462,1,"The game has lovely graphics, and creative-educational games. My son enjoys matching the poop with the correct farm animal. However, it is a little difficult for him to understand what the directions are or what he's supposed to be doing in the game. It's a bit &quot;word heavy&quot; for a boy who has an auditory processing disorder, but he does enjoy clicking on the animals to see if they'll poop. In fact, anything to do with poop will entertain him. It's really better geared towards older kids and younger children who can handle higher level learning."
13910,0,"I was familiar with this product before I purchased it because a friend had a copy on her computer. So I knew it would help with improving my speed, however, it is a little harder to fix finger placement on the keyboard, which is what I wanted to work on. And while the practice lessons did offer some guidance re. finger placement, its not enough. And, there isn't much variety with the games and lessons, so I found myself remembering the lessons and typing from memory as opposed typing from the screen."
93549,2,"I had a prior version (NIS 2003) and was very pleased with it. I ignored poor reviews and complaints about recent versions of NIS and upgraded when the older version was no longer supported. I should have heeded the reviews as all their problem became mine. It noticeably slows down your computer, your email, your web browsing...and has applicaiton errors when you shutdown/log off windows.After one month I took a risk and purchased Zone Alarm 2006 and have been extremely pleased: no, it's not ""perfect"" but it works well, actually seems to catch things NIS didn't and it doesn't seem to slow down the computer (noticeably better performance than NIS).As a web programmer I'm both a perfectionist but realize, when it comes to software, nothing's perfect....but Symantec could do much better. And if so many people have so many common complaints you think they'd take notice (I guess market share it all that matters)."

93421,0,"Our office has 10 computers with Norton installed on all of them. Norton Internet Security is easy to install and has a slick interface. It has two flaws. First, in order to have it update virus definitions fully automatically you have to change a setting in your control panel - not in the program itself. And even if you do figure this out, you still have to manually start the Liveudpdate feature from time to time to get the program updates. Also, Norton only stops about 10% of the viruses we receive. That's because they usually update their virus definitions once per week (on Wednesdays), so when a virus comes out, it quickly spreads around the world and into our inboxes, usually on Monday or Tuesday, before we're protected."

When I first got it I spent hours loading and re-loading the software because it would freeze up and just quit. What's with that? I did like the ""pantry"" feature, but when you want to buy two different sizes of the same item, trying to figure out the ounces takes major time. I think Valusoft needs to listen to their customers before releasing their product. But the recipes are a hugh benefit.That's the only reason I didn't return it...."

I got tired of doing the same puzzles over and over, it would have been nice if each skill level had a new set of puzzles.One good thing about this game is it works on both Windows machines and Macs, although the second Zoombini game, Mountain Rescue, does not work on Macs.All in all, a cute game, but likely to be tired of quickly."
31357,0,"The game is alright. My 5 year old has a hard time learning how to use the arrow keys. Thats the only way you can race. But with practice he will get it. The graphics really aren't that great, and the races themselves are too hard for the target age. Otherwise it is fun. You can play a two player game. That is the only plus I can think of though."
68283,1,"Contrary to most of the reviews I have read here, I am happy with this product. I used it to capture videos from my old Sony D8 PAL camera, even when I bought the equipment in the US, and everything went fine. I have also edited some movies, mixed photos and videos from the old camera and the new NTSC DVD camera, and the results were amazing.I had to pay a little extra for Dolby 5.1 activation, but i worth the money. And the timely registration of the product gave me free MPEG 4 and DiVX activation codes.It is not an easy to use software, but the learning curve is OK for me. I have had no crash, except when installing (exactly when the Microsoft SQL server was in installation phase). I have a P4 3 GHz machine with 1 GByte RAM, and Win XP Home."
94134,1,After reading previous reviews I was concerned about installing5.0 platinum with windows XP.It was an easy install taking 5 minutes and the program is working great. I did not install take 2 as advise by Roxio and I don't need the CD copy program because you can copy CD's with easy CD creator or Soundstream.The secret for an easy install is . . . 1 - 2- 3Download the two patches from Roxio.1. Install the software-5.0- restart computer2.Install XP up exe. restart3. Install 5.02v upgrade and restart.Thats it and the normalizer is great and the photo slideshow is spectactular with a different look
31376,1,"Great product. A 4 year old had a great time playing it and learned to think (whether he knows he was learning or not). As soon as he completed it the first time, he wanted to play again. I think that a 4 year old needs an adult needs to be present to insure continous progress instead of frustration. Would definitely buy it again."
6930,0,"It is easy to use and enter stamps, Documentation is lacking and only helps for setup and to get you started entering stamps. There is a lot more you can do with this software. By trial and error I have been able to add more info on the stamps and its release history. There are many reports you can choose from, or create a report of your own, but no instructions on how to do so. I feel someone who knows Microsoft Access will not have any problems creating any report. My software never updated last year at all even though it would search for updates, it would look for the 2011 version and not the 2012 version."
72798,1,"I have had Weatherbug Pro for three years now, I love it and when the previous reviewers mentioned the ads, well thatis only with the free version. With Weatherbug Pro there are no ads, or popups or anything mentioned in the first three reviews. All of those people said they installed then removed it. Well I installed and have been using it for three years.I have my local weather and the weather of my vacation spots and even family on the east coast all on this and can keep track of all of all of them. I can even see Live Camera shots at any of these locations. This is invaluable when planning a weekend drive to Palm Springs or elsewhere, you get an up to date look at the weather and a forcast too.I highly recommend this product. Most of my friends use it too."
46497,2,"I gave this a 2 only because the package includes softcopy TOPO maps. The route tool is the most primitive SW I've seen in decades. I expect a lot more from a company like Nat Geo. THERE IS NO UNDO! The manual states to ""SAVE AS"" occasionally as a means of undo. That may have been an acceptable solution in 1985. It's hard enough trying to draw via mouse freehand, but having to delete and start from scratch many times because there is no undo is inexcusable.If you use this SW, draw your route in segments, so when your hand twitches and you inadvertently scribble all over the map you can delete the last mess. Then go back and join the segments, but even this will require using the 'split in two' function and trying to re-join the routes, as they don't always connect even though the line you drew to join the segments overlaps.There's really no excuse for not having the SW follow the trails on the maps, given some direction from the user (like draw a box around the trail segment you want). Yes, it's a little compute intensive extracting a route from a bit-mapped graphics image, but that's not really s big deal on a modern PC/MAC with Gbytes of memory and thousands of MIPS."
39073,1,I am glad that I got a chance to have Chem Tutor Excalibur this year. Chem Excalibur helped me to learn more stuffs about the subject of matters and to feed back the course. I am now getting good grades on the class by solving problems every night before the tests and quizes. It has many kinds of problems to examine your chem ability. You can also look over the wrongs from explanations and notes. It is very very well-made for you to study by yourself. There is no better chem materials than Excalibur!

754,2,"I have been a Painter user since 1995. I started out with version 3.1 on a Mac Quadra 700. Painter has gone through a few owners in its lifetime. It started with Fractal Design. It then went on to MetaCreations. Then Corel bought it and has magically transformed a once reliable, stable, intuitive art program into a crashy, overly complicated pile of junk.I'm running 9.5 on an intel Mac Pro and I cannot believe what a nightmare this thing is. Unfortunately, I cannot run my old MetaCreations version 5.5 on OSX because it will no longer support classic applications or I most surely would.My advice to new artists is to learn Photoshop and stick with it. I never thought the day would come when I would say that, but Photoshop has become vastly improved, while Painter has gone straight in the toilet.If you don't think it's that big of a deal, imagine learning to play the piano and getting damn good at it. And then suddenly, the only manufacturer of the piano decides he wants to put the keyboard on the bottom of the thing and halfway through the tune you're playing, it quits abruptly.Don't buy this junk. And I will bet you a dollar to a donut, that their version 10 will not be any better, either."
29315,1,"A lot of the other reviewers mentioned that this game is shorter than the others in the series. I didn't really find that at all. I guess it might be an hour or two less in length, but it's not as bad as some people are making it.Story-You are going to an amusement park in New Jersey to figure out why the carousel is starting up all by itself in the dead of night. Along with this incident, the roller coaster stopped for no reason in the middle of the ride. Figure out who is doing this as you interrogate suspects and search the park for clues.Graphics-Of course, it was a tiny step up as it always seems to be. The characters a little bit better as were the backgrounds. I have to say, though, when you get to ride the carousel (which you can ride as many times as you want) it isn't like you are just looking at a ride on a screen. With a little bit of imagination, you can almost feel like you're on the ride. No, I'm not strange, I just have an imagination.Sound-It has happy, almost, carnival music. It is not like this the entire game through (sometimes they tried to make it spooky), but it is mostly carnival type music. The voice acting once again wasn't perfect, but that's okay in my opinion.Gameplay- As always this is a first person point-and-click game. The game takes place all in one day, so you can't change to night or something, but they added a room service option to this game, so anytime you want, you can go to the hotel you are staying at and ""eat."" But don't worry, you never have to eat to survive or something. Oh! Another new feature is that you have a cell phone for the first time! No more having to go the phone to call Bess and George. However, I have to mention, there are a LOT of people to call in this game. By the end of the game, you probably have at least 10 numbers in your phone. It can get annoying.Fun-It was a fun game as it has a midway (arcade) where you can go to play some games. The only thing is that they tried to make it scary in some areas, and it just wasn't. The haunted house wasn't even scary. This is really one of the least scary games in the series, I think.Length-Like I said, I didn't find it THAT short, but as opposed to the other games, this one takes about 8-9 hours to play straight through. It'll probably take longer the first time you play it through.It really is a good game (hence the 4 stars) but it does have its problems like most of the games. I definitely recommend that you get it, and I would also recommend it as a great game to start with if you are new to the series."
85050,1,"Item as listed, fast delivery, and EXCELLENT service. I would absolutely do business with again!!"
7286,1,"My 8 yr old daughter loves this game. As I watched her play, I wanted to play too, which is not the case with most of her PC games. There are quite a few ""fabrics"", clothing styles, shoes, hairstyles, and accessories (decals for the clothes) to choose from. You can also change the stage, stage lighting, music, and walkway moves for the models. The only way I would improve this game would be to add jewelry choices. Definitely worth the money."
53309,1,"This 5 disc collection makes a great starting package to build a loop library from. The loops are categorized well and there is a file included with root note and bpm info on each disc. Magix has excelled in the techno/trance, hiphop and disco/house discs, however the Strictly 80's could easily have been named the Cheesey Rejects. PopRock had many mainstay rock beats that can easily be used across multiple genres. Another weak spot is that I can actually hear the backing track on the vocal samples on the disco/house disc, presumably coming from the headphones of the singer during recording. It's a quiet tinny sounding beat, and on one series I can even hear the piano line of the song she's singing to. A little sloppy.All in all I gave this a 4 of 5 stars. I will definitely be using this a lot despite it's flaws."
33652,1,Easy Media Creator 7 offers an easy to learn and understand interface that enables you to quickly use any of the applications that make up this integrated software suite. There's many powerful tools available that I can't possibly mention them all here. A couple of my favorite tools are: DISC COPIER - Last night I used it to copy a DVD of my daughter's recent high school band field show competitions that was made by another band parent. The DVD copying feature worked great and I mailed the high quality DVD copy to her Grandma this morning. VIDEOWAVE - I also enjoy using the timeline video-editing feature to edit my videos like the professionals.This product is so good I think it should be rated 6 out of 5 stars!
22323,1,Item was as advertised and arrived in very short time after ordering. I am very satisfied.
51313,1,"This game is a MUST HAVE for people who want to run a movie studio.... even though that might be a big dream. What you probably want to do is make movies. In that case you need to know that this game doesn't give you ABSOLUTE freedom, as I had thought, but instead has a lot of pre-rendered ""scenes"", that you can put together to make a movie. You can still do alot, just not everything.But in the actual game mode, you don't really focus on even what your movies are about! You're too busy trying to run everything and keep your stars happy. Stuff gets out of hand really fast! What I loved about this game is that you start out thinking, ""Ya sure, I could run a studio"", and the game goes ""ok"", and just puts you there. And you're like ""ummm, now what...?"". lol. It teaches you a lesson!Excellent game overall but you really do need a FAST system. I've got a Mac: Dual-2GH G5 Tower with 2.5GB of Ram, and I was still running into slow reaction times. :-( I guess if you've got the new Pentium Quad Mac.... But ya, like who does..."
8266,1,"Reviewer: A software user from Berkshire, United KingdomAt first glance this upgrade may look like it offers little new other than the healing brush, but a little closer inspection shows that there are a multitude of new tools including the Healing Brush, the Patch tool, the new brush options, the ability to create your own new tool presets and workspaces, enhancements to the liquify tools, the introduction of the pattern maker, the new auto-colour command, support for JavaScript, AppleScript and Visual Basic scripting, and numerous other introductions and enhancements. Granted not every enhancement or new feature is relevant to everyone's workflow especially because both print and web designers use the application - but to dismiss it out of hand as a meagre upgrade is shortsighted. Maybe it just takes a little time and patience to find all of those new features.Another reviewer mentioned ""An annoying feature is the lack of being able to switch to multiple open document windows via the Windows menu"" - this feature is there, just use Windows > Document and all the open documents are listed.Just by having a look at the table of contents for the Photoshop 7 Upgrade Essentials book - the TOC is on the Amazon.com site - you'll get a better idea of all those features. Then you can consider for yourself whether to invest in the latest release!"
38405,1,"I bought an Apple computer, a Mac Book Pro, but needed to run a few Microsoft programs. So, the people at the Apple store advised me to get VMfusion for the Mac (they recommend it over Parallels), and then to buy a copy of the Windows operating system and install it on the Mac, ""inside of"" VMfusion. It works great! I run Internet Explorer, a real estate contracts program, and other PC programs, on my Mac. I was even able to install a printer driver, using the PC disc, onto the Mac and it works great. FYI, the Windows disc comes with the statement ""For distribution only with a new PC"", but it did include the Certificate of Authenticity (COA). It also says ""Version 2002"" and ""Includes Service Pack 2"" [SP2] on it, which is the version that the Apple people advised me to get, for use on a Mac. I was told to avoid trying to install Vista on a Mac. Anyway, it's been 2 weeks and so far so good."
19802,1,"I have another Nancy Drew game Treasure in the Royal Tower but that game was very slow-moving,had no excitment,had no helpful hints from Nancy's friends and I just had to try something else because I really had no interest.

21868,1,This is the best. We tried other brands such as Punch Platinum Pro 4.5 and several operating systems - win2000 winXP. Broderbunds program performed the best and was by far the easiest to use. Be careful Punch struggles to access the file system on win2000. And Sierra home design is a discontinued product with Sierra. So support is limited. Broderbund soared above the rest but its 3D rendering was much faster running on winXP than on win2000. A definate recommendation.
24713,1,"I bought this software recently and was pretty skeptical about speech recognition capabilities in general. After using Dragon 6 I really changed my mind. Not only the speech technology is very efficient but the software also has a lot of functionalities to drive your computer by using speech.When you buy the software don't get confused with Dragon 5.0 which is the old version and which has nothing to do with the capabilities of Dragon 6.0. Dragon 6 is also way better that IBM Via Voice that I tried at a friend's place. Anyway, Scansoft the maker of Dragon 6.0 is the leading speech software company so you can't be wrong. One thing: the training of the software is very quick and easy."
94714,1,"It didn't take much for me to want to give SmartSpanish a try because I had such great results with their other program, SmartFrench. The Smart language programs are so unique because they teach you how to speak and understand a language the way it is ACTUALLY spoken. Unlike French, however, which I began study as an adult, I had an early background in Spanish but hadn't studied it since high school and that was many years ago. I recently moved to LA and decided since I was in an environment where I can actually practice the language, I might as well try to reacquaint myself with Spanish. But I do not have time to study it now, I just want to understand it and refresh what I already know. This program is absolutely perfect for that because I can listen to one of the conversations at my convenience whenever I want to practice my listening and speaking. I also bought a tiny Spanish dictionary. Now when I run across a Spanish TV channel I actually understand much of what is said which is really weird. I even started speaking some Spanish here in LA with confidence which is something I never did when I was a formal student! SmartSpanish is a great complement to formal study or a do-it-yourself course of study. I am proof that no matter what your background is you will benefit from this technique."
80720,1,"My three older children have enjoyed the Mystry of the carnival caper, They like riding the rides and being the first to win a prize at the sideshow as several children can join in.The game play is fairly basic once you realise that you find a clue and go to the place the clue describes and you will find the next clue or you will see the suspect and have to catch him. You sometimes find keys which you will need to rescue ken. The magifiying glass is often nessecary to find the hand print that leads you to the clue. You can talk to the other characters. Catching the suspect is not always easy but if you do loose him you get another chance by following his footprints to more clues.The good points are riding the rides is fun, there are three suspects all which are randomly chosen as the criminal and you dont know until the end which one it is, so the end is always a surprise. No two games are the same as the order of the clues is very random. The place where ken is hidden changes each time. There is plenty of replayability.The bad points, character control is very clumsey, you use the mouse but must place the arrow at the edge of the screen to get the barbie to walk where you want her too, my younger children found this quite frustrating as the position of the mouse does not relate well to where the character is.You must pick a name from the list and although it is a large list with a good variety of common and uncommon names your childs name may not be there particulary if it is a boy, then you have to pick something that is close in sound or an acceptable substitute, Barbie requently refers to your child by name so if the names not there it makes it difficult.Overall it is a fun game, just remember to follow the clues as one clue leads to the next and finally the suspect and if you get stuck use the magnifying glass and follow the footprints. The clue computer does show the hot clue, the one you havent followed and the cold clues the ones that have already led you to a clue, and remember there may also be a key or tool you need hidden in the same place as a clue so look around with the magnifying glass even after you have found the clue."
19051,1,We recently drove through the northern lakes area of Italy and found the gps an invaluable tool for us particularly because street names are not always detectable in Europe. It not only helped with finding our location but was also helpful in planning how long to allow for us to get to our destination. An essential if one plans to drive on their own on a European vacation!

2045,0,"I don't think this edition was worth releasing when the superior, more reliable Windows 2000 was being released in a matter of months. I used it for a period on someone's machine and the main thing I remember was that it wasn't very reliable, I remember it had problems recognising two separate CDR drives. Alot of the usual Windows options you'll find are gone aswell. It's OK, but if you have a new machine then go for XP or 2000, and if not use 98SE."

9943,1,"Greek Tutor is excellent and well worth using. (Fwiw my software is labeled QuickVerse, not Parsons, but it should be the same.) I really appreciate the graduated way it has you learn the material, e.g., you finish multiple choice quizzes on vocabulary before you move on to quizzes where you have to type the vocabulary word yourself. On the downside, some of the later material isn't covered as in-depth as in a real Greek class.You can read a lot of reviews here telling you the software won't work on your machine. But don't believe them! Certainly it's based on a dated software product (files last modified February 18, 1998!). Other reviews here will instruct you how to use compatibility mode to get it working on a 32-bit machine (worked for my Win-7 netbook), but I'm going to tell you here how to get it working with 64-bit Win-7. The technique might also work with other flavors of Windows; who knows?The software package (language?) Greek Tutor runs on is called ToolBook, and was originally (back in the day) developed by Asymetrix Corp. Fortunately it's still maintained by SumTotal Systems. Follow the first link below or google them to find their Knowledge Base article ID# P2720. From that page, download the latest TB Runtime Installer (currently v. 11) and run it to install ToolBook.After that's done, to get the program to work, you need to double-click the .TBK file in each chapter folder (e.g., GKTUTOR\CHAPT_1\1_ALPHAB.TBK)--it will now run with the current version of ToolBook. It doesn't work perfectly, for example, the links in the main menu file (in GKTUTOR\INDEX\) won't take you to the chapters. That's why you have to go into each chapter folder and double-click the .TBK file directly.Enjoy learning Greek![...]"
9557,0,"I bought Toast 8 for the Tivo feature and it works adequately - although the controller, based on EYETV software, isn't as complete as I'd like it - in terms of fast forwarding, rewinding, speed, etc. And there is something I can't figure out, even with the instructions, in terms of burning disks. No matter what I try to burn, Roxio tells me there isn't enough room on the DVD. So it is only fair. iDVD works more easily than Toast."

You simply select how much space you have available (256MB, 512MB, or 1GB) on your PSP storage memory stick. I use the 1GB which gives me a beautiful full screen PSP movie.XOOM also lets you select other special features such as song videos and behind the scenes through their ""movie options"" button. I start here to make sure I select the main movie with english audio and then add a song video too.I store a bunch of movies PSP-converted (mp4) on my external drive for later for my daughter to select from."

I called their customer service, it is horrible, or should I say &quot;Customer NO Service&quot; since there is none. They me to call another number &quot;didn't work&quot;. I called the main number for service and find I need an access number. Bottom line, I paid for a fax software which I downloaded and they didn't send me a disk. They turned on the demo and that now doesn't work. All my files are stored on the demo version where I can't get to them. I'd be glad for Hot fax support to e-mail me a solution. If they don't support this, why do they build and sell such software, and who will buy that?If you are thinking to buy it and will need support sometime down the road, forget it, give it up and look for something else."
65553,1,"I used Roxio back when it was called Adaptec and then migrated to Nero software. I've run through all of the Nero versions and, prior to Roxio 9, used Nero 7 Ultra Enhanced. I got frustrated with Nero because it would never finish creating a video project without crashing. I got tired of wasting discs so I thought I'd give Roxio 9 a try. Burning a DVD with Roxio takes forever but I haven't wasted a disc yet. The accuracy and quality of the finished burned product is astounding. I'd rather sacrifice a little speed to gain a better finished product any day. And the interface is more user friendly than Nero 7."

67454,0,"I was hoping this set would contain the first CD or at least part of the first CD in the two-CD Instant Immersion programs, which would have been a great deal, and would have truly given you a good start in all these languages. However, this set only has very basic material for each language, and in fact is more like having a basic CD vocabulary and phrasebook for each language rather than a real mini-course or introduction, which for me is only marginally useful.The vocabulary sections are divided up into 8 sections: first words, colors, food, numbers, shopping, countries, time, body. The ninth section is for phrases, and one advantage is that they are pronounced individually for you, which you can do for the individual words, too. There are two categories of games, easy and hard, and the program tracks your progress.If you like to collect lots of phrase books with basic vocabulary, this might be fine for you, as you can at least learn some words and phrases that might be useful, but for me the major shortcoming is there is nothing on the grammar. I would rather invest the money in the 2-CD version of the half dozen languages I'm interested in, and then pay the extra for the 5 and 8 CD advanced Instant Immersion software when I'm ready to progress to the next stage of learning.Still, for a reasonable price you get 33 languages, including all the main European ones plus things like Swahili, Korean, Finnish, Hindi, Tibetan, Vietnamese, and so on. So if you like to play around with exotic languages this might be the set for you, but you'll need to supplement it with a real language learning course if you're serious about really going anywhere with your studies.I need to mention one drawback to the CD's, however. I have reasonably fast, 16x read and 48x write speed CD, and the program still runs fairly slowly, although I have a half gig of RAM and a 2.6 GHz system. It's mostly noticeable when using the pronunciation capability, but it spends a lot of time just seeking when you're jumping between sections. It's tolerable on my CD player, but if you have an older, slower one, be advised it's going to be slow.One solution would be to get Tenebril software's Virtual Drive Manager program which will copy it to your hard disk so you can run it from there. I've tested it on about a dozen programs and it works on most of them. So it's not a sure thing but the program isn't that expensive and it does work for many things.

Loaded very easily on the macbook pro. *****Make sure you save the registration number from the plastic wrapper. ****I'm new to apple computers and I needed a way to use a handful of windows only programs on the macbook: ProEngineer, Quicken.I'm using bootcamp to switch between OSX and XP and I've formatted the windows partition as NTFS. From my internet research this combination offers the most stability for xp and allows XP to utilize the full power of the mac (which I need for ProE)I'd recommend XP+bootcamp as a must have for new mac converts to ease the transition."

21496,1,"I loved this program. I had taken French thirty years ago for a semester and a couple of adult education courses before starting. The CDs have learning tools for comprehension, vocabulary, present and past tense, speaking and dictation. It uses a video to begin the lesson with both spoken and written dialogue. One can follow along with the written until familiar. The lessons build on the video. There are different games to improve skills and exercises that require one to repeat words, rearrange sentences, fill in blanks, match words for meaning, and answer questions. The variety kept me interested. There are tools to assess how well one is doing. I would highly recommend it for someone with some basic vocabulary and verbs."
68705,0,"Over all a very good map program:Pros: Zoom levels, ease in finding location, can copy map and paste into outlook address book, friendly interface.Cons: Label orientation lacks ability to custom rotate to any position, lacks a easy way to custom trip streets, and the map locations are not as up to date as MS living Maps."
67254,1,"This is the CD-ROM GAME for PC's, not the movie, as the 2 people who reviewed this item below me mistakenly indicated. The packaging is a bit misleading, but it is the game, based on the movie. My 7 year old son just got this game, having played the demo that was included with the DVD movie, and wanted the full game. Instructions and game objectives are clear, though it may be more for the 8-10 year old crowd. Younger players may need some assistance reading instructions. It's challenging, and holds his interest, and graphics are very good. If you like the Wild Thornberrys, you will enjoy the game."

47939,1,"I like this game a lot. It is one of my favorite games on my computer. There are ten breeds of Dogz to adopt. Bulldog, Chihuahua, Lab, Great Dane, Sheepdog, Dachund, Dalimation, Mutt, Poodle, and Scottie. You can adopt pigz too. I love the way each breed has their own unique little quirks. The Sheepdogs are really big and goofy and clumsy. The Chihuahuas are tiny, loud, and can get annoying if you adopt too much of them. The Scotties are really tiny, and fuzzy, and cute.There are over a hundred toys and clothes to choose from. I like the knew playscenes a lot. The best part is that you can breed your dogs. Just don't get too carried away. Anyways, this is a great game and I reccomend buying it."
75307,1,"Okay. I'm 12 now, and got this game when I was about 5, but I must admit that I'm truly disappointed with it's inability to work on XP. I really love this game, and I don't even like Barbie! You don't really have to to like this game, though. Can you believe the fun still hasn't ended for me yet? I really hope they re-release it with the ability to run on XP.(and yes, I have goofed with the capability settings!)If they do so, I'd recommend this simple and fun game to any mother looking for an awesome kid's game that will last through the years."

92953,1,I'm fairly new to Painter. The best description of Painter 7 is it's like an art studio w/o the mess. It comes w/ many varying tools that can aid many artists needs. The program itself has a very high learning curve and takes a lot of customizing to get the result you want. Along w/ the software I recommend buying a tablet because painting w/ a mouse isn't a fun thing to do.
53820,1,"The program is great and very helpful. It has a printable dictionary for each section as well as a portion of each section where you use a microphone to speak the words being taught to help you say everything properly! I love the program itself, the only downfall is that you'll really like it and when you want to move to intermediate and advanced you find that the publisher doesn't have Farsi for either of those!! I think it's pretty sad that they start you off and then don't have Farsi in intermediate or advanced but at thelst the beginner's program is great!"
45700,0,"How is this version? It's good. It found all of my hardware, including my printer and modem. I am not using a Win Modem.Is it better then Windows XP? No it's not. Having read some of the reviews, I see that quite a few of the reviewers have never worked with Windows XP. I have run Windows XP at work and help take care of over 80 computers. Moving from Windows 98 to Windows XP dropped our help call rate 80% - 90%. Windows XP has only crashed 5 times on any of our computers in the last year and a half. Applications crash, but don't take the OS down with them.This linux version will only let me run my screen resolution at 1024 x 768. It took a while to get to one that didn't make my screen look funny. Linux has difficulty running 2 or more applications at one time. It is slow, both loading applications and running them. I have had to reload the OS 3 times in the last 2 weeks. I tried to download the latest Python Version and although I followed the directions somehow it didn't &quot;bring in&quot; everything and many of the applications in SUSE failed. Then I tried downloading some of the larger updates on a T1 line and installed them, using RPM. It again killed part of the OS, so I reloaded. It was quite frustrating.Also you have to hunt for information on how each of the applications work, the setup, etc. This means that you spend a lot of time hunting for information on the application, you are interested in.Having said this, I think this is the best that Linux has to offer. RedHat was nice, but has left the personal Linux market. I have a 26.6k bytes line, and don't have unlimited access to the T1 for the amount of time needed to get the full Linux Installation downloaded. Doing an update, using the automatic updater, works great and you don't have to reboot.Bottom line. If you are new to computers or don't like tinkering with software, buy Windows XP. It is extremely stable and the updates won't crash your computer. The software, in general, is very good.If you like to play with unknown applications, optimize your OS, and/or understand computers/software give SUSE 9 a try. If you are an IT Professional, get this to learn about Linux."

53218,0,"I got Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005 w/GPS early in 2005 and there were quite a few usability issues with the program. The biggest gap was no voice commands. This new version includes new voice command prompts, which are pretty good and on the screen in VERY large size font it shows you what you will do next along with how much of a percentage you've traveled on the road at that moment. For example, if I am on Smith Rd. and will travel on that road for 5 miles before I turn left onto Jones St., on the screen it shows ""Turn left in 5 miles onto Jones St.,"" plus it has a progress bar showing how many of the 5 miles you've traveled.It appears that they haven't fixed some of the bugs and annoyances in trying to find a restaurant or gas station. To illustrate this, if I wanted to find a gas station on my way home from work (15 mile ride), I could choose within so many miles of my current point or so many miles from the entire route. Let's say I'm half way home and decide to look for a gas station, I put 1 mile from my current point, and it looks at a one-mile radius of 5 miles ago?? (Bug, I suppose.) So instead, I put within 1/2 mile of my entire route. Then it lists all gas stations within 1/2 mile of my route (from beginning to end regardless of how far I am from the beginning) and organizes them by distance from my route (instead of how far I am from the station at the moment).I don't have any experience with competitors, but no you know the drawbacks. Overall I'm happy, but don't let your expectations be too high."

38737,1,Each feature of a 1-year subscription to Apple's .Mac 4.0 Online Service provides a near perfect solution for any owner of a modern Macintosh! Easy to use is as always expected with Apple branded products. The most positive feature enables .Mac users to create a personal iWEB site without first learning complecated details and code of how to create WEB sites. One significant negative issue worthy of mention: Apple .Mac's 1 GIG capacity AT THE CURRENT PRICE is no longer a competitive market price; only .Mac's ease of use makes this Apple product worth considering.
77804,1,"I've used Roxio's Videowave and Pinnacle's Editing program and neither can compare with the ease of Ulead Videostudio 8. I'm sure I could get a better system for more money, but for less than $100, I love the ease of creating the timeline and adding and editing audio. I did have the system crash on me once, but since I had saved not long before didn't lose much, and crashing once, in about 300 hours of editing time, isn't bad. I wish the title feature had more options, but other than that I think it's great."
63863,0,"Now that my husband and I are retired and he is receiving social security, I decided I needed help with the income taxes that I have been doing by myself for over thirty years. I also used this program to do my daughter's taxes. The program is easy to load and fairly easy to understand. It asks questions and you just fill in the blanks. There are two problems though!1. If you stop or want to look at something else, you have to begin at the beginning, every time. This was very annoying and time consuming.2. Did not import federal tax information to my Alabama state taxes so had to do them by hand.3. The main problem I have with TURBO TAX is, after paying $30+ for the program, they want you to pay $30 more to file electronically. This was very unacceptable to me and I'll be looking for a program next year that provides both services."

9610,1,"I've read dozens of software reviews of Roxio software for the PC/Win that were far less than complimentary. I needed something to use with my TiVo, but the reviews were so bad, and I'd already been through torture using a Nero suite, that I skipped it. But recently Amazon had Toast on sale, and there was a rebate available as well.Since the reviews seemed better than the PC products, for $40, I figured I'd give Toast 8 Titanium a shot on my MacBook.I'm glad I did. It seems like it was made for TiVo. I was able to burn a DVD from a TiVo recording that couldn't do with a plethora of Windows utilities and programs, including some pretty capable hacks.There is one program that reads my TiVo 'now playing' list with sizes, descriptions, and status. A few clicks and the shows were transferred to my hard drive. I browsed the list of transfers and there was a button at the bottom of the page that said 'Toast it'. Inserted a blank DVD, didn't change any settings, and presto! Played it on the computer and it worked fine. So I slipped in the DVD player for the acid test, and it was all there.I have delved into the various features and functions of the software, but if it just worked with TiVo so seamlessly, I got my money's worth.If you have a TiVo box of recent vintage (I have a Series 3, so don't know the capabilities of earlier boxes), and a Mac that supports Toast (again, I have a MacBook Pro with OS X 10.5 so don't know if it supports OS's before Tiger), it doesn't seem you can go wrong with Toast 8.I also recently purchased a Slingbox. So I can watch anything on either of my two TiVos anywhere I can connect to the internet, or make a DVD to take with me to watch anywhere I can find a DVD player. Too bad this stuff wasn't available when I traveled a lot for business.I'm in couch potato heaven. I am pleasantly surprised, and very pleased with this purchase."
51319,1,"It's all I've every wanted to do, make my own little movies, and this game provides me with a good foundation for that. It's like Sims, but a much cooler idea, at least in my opinion. I don't use the mogul bits of the game, so my review might not be suitable to help everyone who reads it. I go straight to the Sandbox mode where I can have ultimate control and make my little films. The trouble with the game is it's so very limited in terms of sets, costumes, etc, though there are forums with lots of great user created content to draw from. I'm currently on a Mac, so there are a few things that don't work as well or as smoothly as on PC. My original actors don't hold their features on my computer, sadly... so I'll be inheriting a PC laptop soon and start to create all of my films there instead. This will also open up the loads of great user content that I can't utilize on my mac either. The export feature is so easy!!! Overall, I do love this game and just wish the developers would release a nice updated version with lots more stuff and capabilities included."
32184,0,"*** This is a partial retraction to the original 5-star review I gave this. I've since abandoned this product for McAfee's Firewall (as bundled with VirusScan 7).The best mix of features, customization, and power has always been AtGuard, but that product has been licensed to Symantec and released as the inferior Norton Internet Security software. I can say that Zone Labs has gotten some of it right, but the Broderbund edition is not updateable and the controls are flawed. Worse? It is susceptible to buffer overflows.Out of the box, its wizard-like setup routine makes it easy for anyone to lock down their machine without screwing up their Internet access. The associated help is relevant and informative, and I would have no problem letting my mother set up Zone Alarm herself (of course, she'll still ask me if she should click on ""Next"", but that's fine with me).However, after using the product, I can now state with wistful certainty that the granularity, while there, is somewhat lacking. The Privacy Advisor is constantly annoying users, and there's no easy way to limit what kinds of ""things"" it monitors.Worse, blocking hostnames and IPs isn't very easy, and it should be.Worst? 20-February-2004 saw the news releases of buffer overflow vulnerabilities with ZAP4 and ZAP4.5. The good news is that Zone Labs is making updates available. The bad news is that if you're a Broderbund-originated user, you've already encountered problems with your license not allowing you to update the software.In the end, I got tired of emailing the absolutely stupid Broderbund support people for help, and Zone Labs surprised me by not helping one bit (they actually turned me back to Broderbund without so much as an apology for the denial of help).I went back to McAfee's Firewall, did a little configuring, and I think it'll work for me long-term. I've despaired of ever seeing AtGuard resurrect in my lifetime, and there's no way Norton-Symantec will ever rewrite their NIS product to match its old standard of excellence. So, McAfee it is.Fred"

67235,0,"I was quite pleased with this software, but I agree that it is not that helpful for true beginners. It has a wide variety of learning activities and contains a surprising amount of material. It is much, much better than the overpriced and overhyped Rosetta Stone series, though this is still not cheap. However, be aware it is for Castilian Spanish, that is, as it is spoken in Spain, not Latin America; the accent is rather different and some vocabulary differs, too.Of course, learning a language with software is probably not the best way to do it. I think for the same investment of time I have learned a great deal more with audio CDs and workbooks - I, at least, do truly need the workbook as well as the CD to cement the learning. The one advantage of Tell Me More Spanish is that it has a lot of workbook-type exercises built in.[...]"
87323,1,"I'm a long time Mavis fan - from version 5 on. I am a fairly fast and accurate typist, and much of the credit should go to the authors of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. However, it could be better.Pro:If you are an inexperienced typist, you will learn where to place your hands on the keyboard, which fingers do what, and how they work together. You will learn all of the symbols, numbers, and accessory keys. The diagnostic capabilities of the software will target lessons to your specific deficiencies.The lessons are geared to either children, teens, or adults. Different users have different needs, and Mavis is at least sensitive to differences.Con:Little has changed for many versions, and some of the changes that have been made have not been for the better. For example, in earlier versions, you could see very detailed diagnostic info about your typing. Now, this info is watered down a bit.The on screen font is ambiguous. &quot;i&quot; looks like &quot;l&quot; and &quot;1&quot; - a problem that is annoying when your typing accuracy is being evaluated.The interface isn't clear for navigation. Menu options that should always be accessible require you to be in the correct mode.When the software is installed, it does not give you the chance for a custom or advanced installation. You will find that Mavis is running in the background, and that a shortcut for AOL is on your desktop.Although there are custom options in the program, they sometimes affect the lessons themselves. For example, if you do not want Mavis to read the instructions out loud, you can turn off the sound. However, when a dictation lesson is offered, you hear nothing.No Dvorak training is available. This would be neat.So, should you get this software if you are a &quot;hunter/pecker?&quot; Absolutely. Will you always be satisfied? Possibly not. Is there anything better? I don't think so."

40105,1,"Have you noticed? Apple has all the ""In Toys"" that people want when it comes to digital gadgets these days. From the iPhone and iPod Touch to the iMac and iBook, the gadget that brings both status and extraordinary performance, turning your friends green with envy, and turbo charging your digital life comes with a plain little Apple logo on the outside. And it's no wonder! One look at any of the afore mentioned products and the original design quality is evident from the get go. The appearance, the depth of refinement and exacting nature of products that perform as they should both grab you and then hold you in rapt wonder and amazement as you learn more and more. These are tools for the mind from the minds of tool lovers.One of the products that make the Macs such a pleasure to own and use is Apple's iLife program. Now, here's a program that retails at just $79 list, comes bundled with a new Mac, and is five mature applications rolled into one. Any one of the five programs is worth the $79 ticket to ride.iPhoto - Automatically organizes your photo library. It's all here; Professional editing, annotation, classification, publishing. This well mannered program will allow you to take on projects you never deamed you were capable of.iMovie - After using your digital video camera, this is where the movie is made. From clips to scenes to finished works, the program helps you stay organized while you bring it all together and put your own soundtrack to it.GarageBand - A multitrack music sequencer for both the amateur and professional musician. This is your personal recording studio. Most people don't know that they can do this stuff. With GarageBand, they can.iWeb - Automagically create your own web site from your photos and your movies and your creative heart.iDVD - Take those multiple movies you put together in iMovie to DVD. No shortcuts here. You'll make professional looking DVDs you'll be proud to show anywhere.And did I mention that it is only $79?If you already have one of the previous iLife versions, the decision may be a little harder. But, take heart! The improvements to iLife with the '08 version are many. In iPhoto you can now organize by events, a feature that takes this program to a much higher level of usefulness. And on top of that, the editing tools in iPhoto are very much improved. Only pros need Photoshop now. iMovie is rebuilt from the ground up and includes the ability to keep and browse your video library. iWeb has themes and the ability to place web widgets in your creations. And, there's dozens more reasons to upgrade. The improvements over previous iterations of iLife are much too numerous to cover individually here. Suffice to say that you wont be disappointed. If you do upgrade, be sure and keep the old version of iMovie by renaming it before the install. The new one is so different, you may want to have both.And did I mention that it is only $79?What's that? You don't have a Mac? Why that just means that iLife is free for you!As soon as you buy your Mac."
35419,1,"My 5-year old LOVES Spongebob, and definitely enjoys the game. There are three (or four?) areas that have a series of challenges; you have to complete each before moving on to the next. Once you have completed them all, you can go back and play whichever games you like the most. I don't see this as a favorite among older kids (9 and up) -- it could get a bit boring. And younger kids need help with some of the challenges and the trivia games. But, if your expectations are reasonable, it's a cool little game."
78777,0,We had to use this program due to a delay by our tax person. Overall the interface was nice and it walked us through the process. We didn't have any special forms need so that probably made it easier then from what I saw other reviewers have posted.It did offer some advice for 401 deductions.One annoying thing was that electronic filing costs $30 for state and feds.You get 2 tries and then they will charge you again.The feds kept getting rejected because of a supposed error for my wifes birth date. This is bogus as we have filed for years. We ended up printing out the forms and will mail them.State went in ok.We might try it one more time for next year.
12391,1,"I have been using XP home since the day it was released. Having been through each generation of Windows (3.1, 95, 98, 2000), I have to say that it is certainly evolutionary and not revolutionary. However the new functionality that it offers is worth the money.There are a lot of little changes that have been made under the hood, apart from the big one which is that XP is based on NT. There are a lot of subtle changes that make life that much more easier and the OS more appealing.There have been a few reviewers below who seem to have had misfortune with XP. These are obviously users from the Linux or Apple camp, trying to trash Microsoft, or who are simply incompetant at using a computer.XP cannot not promise nirvana to all people who use it because a computer as we know it, is comprised of components (and the associated drivers), that may not always work together in unison. It is far to easy for people to blame Microsoft rather than the makers of inferior drivers. Unlike Apple, a PC is not propritery, so many companies make peripherals.So please be objective when making your XP purchasing decision, and don't be sidetracked by other peoples misfortune with peripherals, that have nothing to do with how well the OS performs and functions."
9405,1,"Unlike everyone else on Amazon.com I've thankfully (knock on desk) only had good experiences with both Norton Personal Firewall 2004 & Noron AntiVirus 2004.It does take PERSISTANCE to train the Firewall properly and to get comfortable with the IE security and Cookie settings, but after about 2 weeks of teaching the software its been gravy... and I thankfully haven't had any major intrusions, file corruptions or viruses that I'm aware of in the past 8-months.Downloading updates is seamless, I don't have memory hog issues on my AMD 3200+ w/512 MB Ram, Windows XP SP2 and my high speed DSL connection that's always on. I've turned off Symantec's Popup Blocker and configured the built in one with XP SP2. I set IE to prompt each time a website asks to install cookies. I've set the Firewall security setting to ""High-Block Everything Until I approve it"". Other than that, I manage Java Applet & Active X security within IE. I did try setting these to ""Medium - ask me each time"" and it worked as well. Really, the first 2-weeks in which you visit most of your key banking, finance, news, gaming and other websites is the important period which REQUIRES PATIENCE. The trick again is teaching the firewall which sites you approve and which you don't. According to various studies, the average internet user spends 80% of their online time on less than 10 websites. After the first 2-weeks, its the 20% you just have to teach yourself and other users of your computer to be smart about.If you're not very comfortable with computers and are only a basic user of e-mail, news & regular websites... this is a great program as long as you have a techno-savvy son/daughter, friend or colleague who can help you set it up the first time. If you're a pretty advanced technology buff you'll appreciate the integrated management console between all Norton Programs and will like most of the features. Overall.. it's 4 stars in my book."

85853,1,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is no longer supported by Canon. that being said...Ever find yourself trying to print a web page that looks great on screen, but when you print it via the browser lines are running off the page or fonts are all screwed up? Ever visit multiple web pages while doing research and you want to easily create a single aggregated document containing all the content from the pages you found useful? If so, this software is what you need.I have used this software since 1999 when it came free with a Canon printer I bought. I bought a few copies when I heard it was discontinued so I would have a backup for myself and some copies for friends. I would often have the problem of lines running off the printed page, especially when printing pages or blog entries that contain source code examples and the like. These problems were solved with this piece of software.This software will properly print even the most stubborn web pages that your browser will fail miserably on when trying to print. You can easily collect one or more web pages and have this software automatically fetch nested pages making it great for quickly assembling all the associated pages from HTML documentation, Javadoc, or an entire web site. You can apply different styles and print as multiple columns providing convenience and saving lots of paper. This software is now over 8 years old but I still use it frequently (just used it a few minutes ago in fact). Not sure why Canon let this great little piece of software die!?BTW seems to still work fine on Vista though I had to run setup.exe manually from the CD when autorun failed. I have also used it on Win 98/2000/xp with no issues."
84515,1,"If you're reading this review, then undoubtedly your computer is hooked up to the Internet. If your computer is hooked up to the Internet, then you need an Anti-Virus software package sooner rather than later. Personally, Norton Anti-Virus is the package that I've used on multiple occasions and I've never had the slightest bit of trouble with it.The latest version of the Norton Anti-Virus utility is still easily one of the best protection packages out there. It's incredibly easy to initiate, and the beauty of it is that once you've set it up, you'll probably never think about it again. It sits quietly in the background, using very few resources and just stays nicely out of the way. Updating it with the latest virus signatures is simplicity itself. Virus scans and updates can be set to run automatically or manually.This is a fairly short review, because there isn't that much to say about it from the user's point of view. It does what it's supposed to do, and stays out of one's way while it's doing its job. I have installed this, and previous versions, on a variety of different machines and operating systems, with absolutely no problems at all. Installing Norton Anti-Virus one of the simplest and trouble-free steps in setting up a new computer. If only more software packages were this hands-off and easy."

70580,2,"Norton has always been well-reputed for touting a powerful scan engine that can catch and remove pretty much anything you throw at it. This remains true. Unfortunately, every member of the Norton line since 2006 has bogged down the system so badly you might as well have a virus.I got Norton 360 for free from Symantec because I'm a computer tech working for a company that's partnered with them. In my hand I hold a letter from the Symantec president acknowledging Norton's bad history as a resource hog and the vast improvements made to Norton 360 to improve it.After installing it on my higher-end gaming machine, all I have to say is this: Same problems, new product.The time it takes to get to my desktop from cold-boot is under 40 seconds. After installing Norton 360, it took around 2 minutes to get to displaying my wallpaper, then I had to *manually* start explorer.exe because my icons weren't showing up. The system has been powered on for a half hour now, and I'm still waiting for the Norton taskbar icon to load. What a nightmare.I can justify running this on very high-end computers that can handle it, but if you're still running anything single-core just stay away."
39964,0,"""Joy of Cooking"" is one of the best-known cookbooks ever published, and for good reason. Like the print version, this CD offers some terrific recipes and excellent cooking advice. Unfortunately, the similarities ultimately extend too far. There's simply not enough new material here to warrant a hearty recommendation, particularly to those who already own a copy of ""Joy.""A particular source of disappointment is the software's failure to tap the strengths of the form. For example, the box promises ""100 illustrated, step-by-step techniques every cook should know."" But these techniques rely far too heavily on written descriptions, wasting a perfect opportunity for helpful video files.More irritatingly, many of the recipes do not even include pictures of the finished dishes.Overall, this product is fine for those who are looking for a searchable copy of ""Joy of Cooking."" And there a few other features some will find helpful. But don't expect many extras."

39523,1,"WOW! I have only played the demo, but I have found many ways to complete it. For instance, a certain annoying security bot always bugs me, because I like to snipe, but I lost the option to pick up a GEP (rocket) gun from an agent. So HOW do I off this bot??? Well, you can 1)use the above mentioned GEP gun. 2)you can shoot the bot and draw him to your allied assault bot. 3)you can find some LAMs (Light Attack Munitions), wire one to a doorway, and THEN draw the bot to its doom. 4)find a handy-dandy Electromagnetic Pulse Grenade, and fry its electrical systems. 5)push a TNT crate in its path and shoot the crate. BOOM! Look at that, FIVE ways to take out ONE security bot. In the demo alone!!! I could go on and on but I need to get to a software store to buy this game."
1624,1,It is very useful and I was glad to find it for the price that it was available for.
79391,1,"Well, I bought this product back when I had a Windows XP and it worked great! It had nice brush and pen tools, tones (which I must say I've never used before) and when my Windows XP died unexpectedly, I was surprised to find out that it even work on my old Windows 2000!However, I have recently gotten a Windows Vista for Christmas, and I was very saddened to find out that it wasn't compatible with that system. However, for any person here who is wanting to buy Manga Studio, you will have to upgrade to Manga Studio 4, which works on Windows XP and Vista.Other than it not working on my latest computer, it is a great product!"

27706,1,"For those of you considering buying Money 2002, I'd suggest going to the Microsoft website and downloading the trial version first (which *is* the Deluxe version). It has a two month lifespan, which is perfectly adequate for figuring out whether you will like the product or not. I've spent the last two days mucking around with it and I really like what I see. I like the 'dashboard' functionality where you set up all your account details, portfolios etc, and then Money will tell you which stocks are doing well, doing badly etc. I am very wary of linking bank accounts directly into the internet, so in the meantime I'm just downloading stock information. It is a bit limited on the international stocks side, and the US product is (surprise surprise) catered for US tax law and US investments (eg: 401K). But I would expect that this would all come in handy for someone actually from the US. The best functionality in this product is definitely the dashboard, cash flow and budgeting facilities. Basically every time I log into Money, it updates itself with the latest Money updates (ie: patches etc) and stock values, and tells me at a glance how everything is going. I'd give it five stars, but there are minor gaps in the functionality - like you can't import historical share data if the share isn't on the MSN listings. But this is very minor. It is definitely designed for you to set up all your accounts, all your shares and bonds, set up all the links into the internet to get current prices/values/balances, and then periodically monitor and update as you require. I'm not planning on using all the functionality, but what I have seen is very neat indeed. Up until now, I have managed such information in Word or Excel. I will purchase this product before departing the US as I believe it will save me time in the long run."
12795,1,"yeah, you heard right. My buddy installed 256mb worth of memory on my existing celeron board. He also clocked the processor so instead of running at only 100mhz it now runs at about 500mhz. But believe it or not, XP pro is running flawlessly on a celeron, i guess it's not supposed to, but it does. I had to install a new burning software and my scanner that worked with win 98 doesn't work with XP, but that's no big thing. Honestly, i'm amazed at how much better XP is than 98, it doesn't crash nearly as much (98 was crashing no less than 3 times a week, XP has crashed twice in about 3 months). Plus it looks much better, i got sick of that blocky windows look, i only upgraded to an imac, but have decided to build a new pc with a 2gig AMD cpu and smack XP back on it. Finally bill gates and crew have come through, guess throwing all that money at them over the years was really worthwhile."

3582,1,"My family just bought an LCD tv. The 16:9 video support is perfect for showing videos on the new tv. It's difficult to gather around a PC unless you have a large monitor. It makes more sense that people want to see home videos and photos on a regular tv. Maybe some day the technology will be more integrated, but for now we have to convert files from pc dvds to regular dvd formats. The Roxio program has this support.I also agree that the photo slide show creator is terrific. Besides the built in transitions, the program will also match transitions to the rhythm of the background music. What a great feature."

71379,1,"I liked this software. I used it for 3-4 years until I got a new computer and it apparently was not compatible. Though some parts were hard to figure out and a little tedious, I was able to do everything I wanted with this software--which included writing music in 4 part harmony, a vocal line with an accompaniment, single lines, several verses worth of lyrics, etc. I found all the notations that I needed. Additionally, I was able to make title page entries, play with page numbering and copyright, transpose the whole song, change the size of the measures, easily create a pick-up note, etc.I miss this software. The later cakewalk software does not offer the notational ease of writing that this software provided."
77884,1,"The best I've used untill now. Friendly and easy to use. I would however suggest a few tricks to make it more practical: automatic window resizing to full screen or back, having the possibility of viewing the chosen files to update inside a folder in the compare mode etc."

Note however--that there are new Autopistas and so sometimes you'll have to check the map and know you're going the right direction. This is usually simple to figure out--but note that things change so you can rely on this about 95% so know bascially where you are going. Also---in the city (Bilbao) there is a bit of a delay so that does cause some confusion since there are many 1 way streets, etc. Overall, I was extremely happy having this micro card and it made driving in the North of Spain quite easy."

65683,1,"First of all, I am not a novice. I have used or tried many of the products that Roxio studio competes with. The list includes several versions of Pinnacle studio (8 and 9), Windows Movie Maker, Window DVD Maker, Ulead 8 and 9.The need for Roxio Suite was caused by the fact that none of the above pieces of software could work on my new computer with Vista Home Premium edition. Some could not be installed (like Pinnace). Some could not finish the job and failed half way (like Ulead and Windows DVD Maker).I have tried the product for Copying/burning CD/DVD, making lightscribe labels and for making a home movie with huge number of slides.No problems in copying/burning department. I am more used to Nero's interface, but this is simply the matter of habit.Making lightscribe labels was no challenge as well.As for authoring movies, I was able to capture movies from both VCR and digital camera, create a project with menus, additional soundtracks and slideshows and burn a DVD that works fine. My project was a challenge for the software because in addition to the movies it included several thousand (!) pictures and this caused the project file to grow very big (about 6 MB). So I observed some delays during saving and opening of the project, but those are expainable.Clearly, the UI and features of movie-authoring software are not as convenient as Pinnacle's ones, but unlike the latter, Roxio software gets the job done."

I've seen kids from third grade through seventh really love it. BUT...it does not work with WinXP!!!!! I don't know what Creative Wonders has not offered a new version, but I wish they would. Nevertheless, if you have a MAC or an older version of Windows, I heartily recommend this software."

62711,0,"After trying a couple other ringtone software programs, I will admit that DJ ToneXpress is far superior because it actually works. It is very easy to use and I am able to send the ringtones directly to my phone or friends' phones quickly. My only complaint is that when the software converts the song file into a ringtone, it ruins the sound quality of music clip. When creating the ringtone on the software, it sounds great, but once you download it, it sounds like the song was recorded with a microphone over a speaker phone. And, if the ringtone is too loud, it creates a static noise. Overall, I'm still happy with the product, but the ringtones definitely do not sound like the original music files."
59027,1,"Finally, a financial software program that does the work for you!

I have been pretty happy, except of course, for the fact that there were a few programs that I could not use on the Mac.The Virtual PC was one option, or I could own both a Windows PC and a Mac. The last thing I wanted to do was have my stuff distributed between 2 computers, so I figured I would give the Virtual PC a try. After reading the mixed reviews, I was not expecting the best.Well, its not bad..! Its slow, but then, so is Windows. Actually, in some regards, my Microsoft Money program works faster in Virtual PC than it did in Windows XP!I use it on a Powerbook with 512MB of Ram. Like I said, not bad. Dont expect the stars - if you want to play games, why do you need to do it in Virtual PC?"

81090,1,"My wife and I, like so many others, hesitated at spending several hundred dollars for the Europe maps. But after a 4 hour drive into London, where streets swerve crazily, roundabouts are numerous, and street name signs are non-existant, we quickly realized that this was a life saver.Later in our trip, we headed to Bath, England for our bed and breakfast location. Garmin and the maps took us right to the front door with just the postal code to guide us. The owners told us that no one before had a GPS that took them to their place. The other car that was meeting us there spent 1.75 hours trying to find their way around Bath to the location....and were so frazzled they never saw any of the city!If you go to Europe and wonder if the maps are worth it, believe me they are. Isn't arrival at your destination with you and your wife still happy worth $200??"
48401,1,"I have read most of the reviews on Street Atlas and find it interesting they vary so much. I have used this product version 2006 (with GPS) for 2 years and find it to be very good. I have also tried MS Streets & Trips. Anyone having difficulty with Street Atlas is also having trouble turning on their computer. Please don't degrade the product if you don't have good computer skills to began with. I used this on a 9 day trip to Oregon with complete success. There was only (1) suggested route we had to change because the condition of the road was to bad. The computer generated voice is very good and clear. Once you master the layout of the control tabs (Find, Route, GPS) etc. it becomes very easy to use this program. If you can't you need to address your computer skills and not this program. Please take time to understand the product layout. Once you get the hang of it you will find it works extremely well. Don't listen to the complainers...they could not figure it out if their life depended on it. Here is a tip...setup your destinations in the address book. You can then pick your start and finish from the address book quickly and get your route in the blink of an eye."

I was really surprised at the commonality of the MS Office applications bewteen the two operating systems and the seamless interoperability of the files. The stability of the applications on the Mac platform is excellent and have yet (knock on wood) to have one of the applications crash or hang. Overall I would highly recommend the Mac MS Office application due to it's interoperabilty, fast learning curve and unparalleled stability."
2799,1,"Despite the negative reviews, I took a chance on upgrading from 2006. I'm glad I did. In fact, I can't remember ever having regretted purchasing a newer Quicken product. There are a few features for 2007 that are notable:The graphics have been completely revised and updated. For some people the charts and colors may not be that big of a deal, but for me I benefit from seeing my finances in picture form. This change alone would have been worth the price.The online update feature has been streamlined and improved. In 2006 the online update of accounts was a little cumbersome, especially if more than one bank was used. With 2007, multiple banks are processed easily.The check register has more features for making entries. The tabs are easier to read and offer more options for each transaction.Reports and other screens within Quicken when minimized are easier to restore. In previous version of Quicken once a window was minimized, it was difficult to find it. In this version, each minimized window displays as a tab at the bottom of the screen. Switching between windows is a breeze.While other people may believe large, sweeping changes are only worth the price of an upgrade, I prefer having smaller, incremental changes. The changes here from 2006 are worth the price, but not so overwhelming they can't be mastered easily.Quicken 2007 continues to be the best in financial software. I recommend this upgrade for all users of previous versions of Quicken."

18205,1,"I've been using this software for a few weeks now, and I've been very impressed. It's got a very intuitive interface for accessing the various operations such as burning data, music, or video discs. Burning and copying DVDs is a snap! You can leave most of the options at their default settings and everything works great. The software detects the type of media you are trying to burn, and sets your burner accordingly. You can also burn a disc image which can be mounted to a virtual DVD drive to test your DVD before burning it to disk.Burning mixed CDs isn't quite as elegant. There is a wizard that guides you through the process, but it's cumbersome if you want to make a mix from several different CDs. You can choose not to use the wizard, but I found the various window panes too cluttered to drag the tracks from the source disc to the destination. On the bright side, copying complete CDs is simple enough.Even with the minor complaint of the CD burning interface, I highly recommend this software package."
67124,1,This CD labeler is the highest in quality and I have found it very easy to use with almost no complications.

47583,2,"As a graphic designer I've been happily using adobe products since 1990. The latest release, Creative Suite 3, is an uncharacteristic exception. Acrobat locks my machine and I haven't been able to open a .pdf file successfully yet since installing CS3 (had to uninstall the Acrobat App). Photoshop is very slow with odd periodic freezes for no apparent reason and crashes frequenty. They've also messed up some of the refined workflow within the interface. Flash takes far to long to start up. Overall I'm more happy with prior versions and much more productive with them. The only positive note so far is the ability to copy vector files cleanly and accurately into Flash from Illustrator. I wouldn't recommend this product in it's current state."
26100,1,A SPLENDID SOFTWARE A LAST WHORT THE MONEY. I TRIED OTHERS BEFORE BUT I THINK THIS IS THE BEST DVD BACKUP SOFTWARE EVER ITS GREAT
8533,1,"Let me begin by saying I really want to give this a better rating. What it is, is good. But it's not exactly what is suggested by the packaging and some glitches detract from end-user enjoyment.First, the packaging claims the CD-ROM includes ""100 original, full-length digital comics."" It doesn't. It includes only the story panels from the comics. No ads for X-ray specs or pepper gum or a bazillion plastic army men *now with grenadier!* No Stan Lee's Soapbox (or its equivalent). No fan mail. A good portion of the nostalgia and charm of these comics is missing with these exclusions.Second, the front and back of the box highlight an offer for ""3 FREE COMICS!"" Only once you fire up the CD-ROM and click on the offer do you discover a Shipping &amp; Handling charge. Granted $3 isn't a big deal, but it's aggravating having it snuck in at the last minute.Third, the on-screen interface to the X-Men Comics doesn't work. Someone miscoded the standard hyperlink code, using backslashes (\) instead of forward ones (/). You can still get to the comics through Windows Explorer, but an end-user workaround is a poor substitute for incomplete product testing. Customer support did give me a prompt reply and offered to send a replacement CD-and this accounts for the 4-star rating instead of a 3.Fourth, the Character Bios apparently have been taken from the Marvel Comics Encyclopedia without any cleaning up for this product. This means there are extraneous page numbers on the bio pages. Hyperlinks that would take you to other characters in the encyclopedia do nothing in this product. Artwork bleeds from one page to the next in the encyclopedia, but since all pages are shown singly, there are bits and pieces of art in the margins that give the pages a sloppy look.Finally, while the exterior packaging is very nice (full-color embossed cover, hero shots all the way around, fold-out front cover with more graphics and info inside, etc.) the interior packaging is laughable: a cardboard box containing a half-sheet of installation instructions and a CD-ROM in a paper sleeve. Like a number of these criticisms, it's disappointing to think you're getting one thing (full comic books, totally free bonus comics) and wind up with something much less satisfying.On a positive note, given the way characters were introduced, you wind up with a lot of Iron Man and The Hulk in these comics. Iron Man shows up in his 10 self-titled books, plus he's a member in all 10 Avengers comics and a co-star in all 10 Captain America comics. The Hulk appears in his 10, plus half the Avengers, plus all the Sub-Mariners. Sub-Mariner, the Fantastic Four, and other characters cross-over into other titles, as well. If you're not a fan of these characters, maybe this is a turn-off; but after so many other aspects of this product fell short, it was nice to get something extra for a change.My advice: Wait for this product to come down in price, be packaged in a stand-alone jewel case (which will probably also mean a price reduction), or for current buggy versions to work their way off store shelves. It's not a bad product (the stories are the selling point and they (mostly) come through), but it currently suffers by failing to meet customer expectations."
56457,1,"I am very happy I bought this software for my son, it's saved us all so much time. We used to spend hours on creating times tests on worksheets and checking results. This was a very tedious work and required at least one parent to be involved. With this software all you have to do is to check your child's scores at least once week. It keeps the history of the scores and shows which facts you child have troubles remembering. You can set the time on the test you have created, by the way, you can include any combination of multiplication facts in your test. The best feature that I liked was the option to create a test based on those facts which you child had scored low. It is excellent in every way!"
84718,1,"I tried VideoWave and had such a difficult time as I had NO manual and MGI was not helpful. I heard about Video Factory 2 from disgruntled VideoWave users and gave it a try. The manual is helpful, the Show Me tutorials are helpful and the online help is extensive. I'm very new to video editing and this program seems to be quite intuitive for new users. I'm working on a long project and feel I've got a better chance of finishing with this software."
63951,0,"This version of DarkBASIC is fairly outdated since DarkBASIC Pro came out, but it still allows you to program great games for pretty cheap.I'd strongly recommend visiting the developer's website to download DarkBASIC Lite and DarkBASIC Pro demos. They are fully functional and you'll be able to really get a feel for if this product is for you.DarkBASIC is a fun way to learn some basic programming techniques, but its lack of object-oriented-programming abilities makes it less useful for today's programming needs. But it's one tool that helped me get better at programming logical loops in a fun and creative environment.I should also note that this game programming language is just the language - it comes with no 3D modeler, music generator, sound effects generator or anything like that. So you'll still need to make your own media (it does come with a few models like the gremlin on the box and a tank that you can pull out from the demo programs on the disc).After I tried DarkBASIC Pro, I rarely went back to this version of DarkBASIC. However, I found image saving/manipulation/generation programs easier to do on this version. Everything else is easier and better on DarkBASIC Pro."
62577,1,"I am teaching a class in beginning photography and we focus all of our attention on creating images rather than post-production manipulation and repair. Although I have my own collection of shots for lecture/discussion and we create new ones weekly, this workshop by canon provides a surprisingly comprehensive introduction to many aspects of photography from 'capturing the elusive moment' to learning 'the distinctions between focal point and depth of field', to 'exploring the inticacies of exposure (through combining shutter speed and aperture settings)', to 'the subtleties of composition'. The program teaches 'the rules' of photography and then, through example and interactive practice, challenges the viewer to break those rules with intentionality.I was impressed with the creativity of their means to make these lessons come alive for the viewer. For example, when capturing the moment, they create a moving scene (kayaker dropping through falls) and you trip the shutter for three shots of your choosing and then review how well you anticipated the action. Composition workshops allow you to move and crop images revealing new insights of the same images for new photographers. A lighting workshop done vitually out in the sun, reveals how sun direction in relation to subject influences the outcome. It then allows you to fill-in with on-camera or off-camera flash to see the influence of added light to a daylight scene.Throughout all of these workshops you have the opportunity to get pro-tips on the given topic. In other words, you can experiment on your own through their guided interactive exploratory workshops or you can get the canon (professional) commentary about what it is you are (or could be) learning from the given workshop.Such creative and interactive means of teaching most every basic topic for a new photographer create an outstanding educational opportunity for a generation of picture takers whose cameras are so technically advanced that it causes them never to break beyond mediocrity in their work.As a long-time semi-pro photographer (I am a ecologist/professor for a living) and a professor of photography as well, I strongly recommend this workshop for anyone interested in taking more than just snap shots.Hope this helps."

It's not intuitive, in fact I only found out after bothering to read thru the online Help text, but you zoom in and out using the Palm's UP and DOWN buttons. At higher resolutions street names do appear on-screen.I do agree that the user interface could be more intuitive, and that comment applies to both the desktop and palmtop sides of the program. That said, this software certainly beats completely useless programs such as Rand McNally's Street Finder, which came as free software with my Navman GPS unit, and is worth every penny I paid for it."

I did. Another downside is compatibility. Since most software packages, games and input devices haven't been completely tested as XP compatible, you'll either have to ingnore compatibility issues (this seems to work) or wait for your software to be upgraded."

In fact, I wished they have gone for even more of a classic feel, because the CG battles were more of a distraction, and doesn't feel right when you are mainly playing on a game board. The only disappointment was that I thought this would include the original European map, but it didn't. Really, I mean, does it kill them to have that thrown in with the game? Overall, I had a great fun with it, and it's so addictive that I've afraid to boot it up:)"

In this particular game, there is a part that requires reading, and an advanced understanding of riddles. I suppose he could click and click until he gets it right but that would take a long time and he would get frustrated. (You have to match riddles with the correct answers.) Because of this I wouldn't recommend it for a younger child who wouldn't have the assistance of an adult, but otherwise, it's very entertaining."

There exists no cognitive and logical development. no systematic progression of sentance structure. i have not gone through the whole program's 22 lessons but through several. but i stick by my story as far as far as proper teaching and content that is lacking. phir milege (see you later)."

48732,0,"After two good years with the 2005 and 2006 versions of Trend Micro PC-Cillin Internet Security, I proceed to perform my yearly upgrade to the 2007 version prior to renewing my virus subscription.Alas, the user experience of the 2007 version was so inferior to the preceding two years' that I uninstalled it and went to a competing product (Kaspersky).The problem began when I displayed 2007's control panel / user interface. A new and entirely unwanted right-side panel for supplementary network services automatically appeared each time I started the user interface. Worse yet, there was no user-accessible control for preventing it from opening every time I started the u.i. An email exchange with Trend, requiring two days to complete, was necessary to learn which key in the Windows Registry I needed to edit to turn this darn ""feature"" off.Next, and unlike the preceding two years' versions, I started having problems with erratic startup. Sometimes all of Trend 2007's necessary Windows services would start at boot, sometimes they wouldn't. If they didn't, I had to bang around the Windows services tool to kick them into life. Even then, parts of the u.i. remained unavailable unless I shut the program completely down and restarted anew. What a pain!So I began two-day email exchange number two. This time I was directed to use a special uninstall utility to *completely* remove the existing build of 2007, download a newer build, and install a ""fixed"" version. Okay, that fixed the erratic startup problem but the email exchange with Trend Micro burned up another two days not to mention the time I spent uninstalling / reinstalling / editing the Windows Registry / etc.Finally, I started to explore all the new 2007 features. Oops -- I received an ""invalid instruction address"" error message when I tried to open a particular feature's controls.Once again a two-day email exchange with Trend support was necessary. Once again I downloaded a putatively newer build, used the utility to uninstall the old build, and installed a third updated version. Alas, the identical error presented itself when I went to the u.i. controls for the feature.Well, since I need to use my computer as a tool of work I had no more time to spend debugging Trend's software for it. So, feeling a combination of anger (""why won't it work?"") and sorrow (""idiots, why did they have to wreck a good product?""), I uninstalled and installed a competing product.Trend Micro Internet Security 2007, unlike my 2005-2006 versions, simply wasn't usable. My experience was that Trend went just a bit too far with new and not necessarily useful features and not far enough with the quality assurance necessary to ensure that all the features worked..."

18966,1,"In the quest to find a decent accounting solution for my sole-proprietorship (start-up), I tried and evaluated several trial versions of accounting software. Of the commercial accounting packages I evaluated, Peachtree accounting 2002 is most inexpensive, given the features. Unlike QuickBooks, it uses heavy-duty double-entry accounting.Unfortunately it is not always the most intuitive accounting package to use. I would go so far as to say there is a degree of difficulty in using this package. Luckily, Peachtree includes a tutorial and several help files. I found myself referring to them often in the beginning, then less frequently as time progressed.Using the included setup wizard, I was able to setup the books in about 30 minutes. Unfortunately, my business doesn't neatly fit into the example companies, so I had to do some customization. In any event, I was soon able to generate purchase orders, with a minimum of effort. Like QuickBooks, it can print out deposit slips.Peachtree Accounting 2002 is a full-featured accounting package, with better inventory management than QuickBooks. It has good scalability and can grow with your company, but be warned, time will have to be invested in order to conquer the learning curve before you can become productive.But don't take my word for it. You can download a trial version from (...) to try it out yourself. I would recommend spending a day putting in the numbers and seeing if it is right for you."

36931,0,"The Home Designer Suite 7.0 is very cool, easy to use, and will make you feel like a pro in a relatively short period of time. However, if you have a split-level entry home on a sloped terrain, be prepared for wailing and gnashing of teeth. There should be a warning on the package.I do not believe that creating a split-level entry is even mentioned in the manual; you will need to link-up to the software designer's website (Chief Architect) which can be done from the Home Designer help menu.After discovering the forbidden secrets and practicing a few times, creating a split-level entry is relatively easy. If you have a split-level entry house, this is a major design feature of your home. So it would have been nice if the manual that comes with the software at least addressed the special challenges.The other major feature of a real-life split-level is the slope of the lot. The house is sort of two stories in the front and one story in the back. Creating a reasonable sloped terrain with the software for this effect seems nearly impossible, unless you write topographical maps for a living.The manual gives you only one poorly-explained example of creating a sloped lot using elevation lines. The video/tutorial gives you one more rapid example, with an arrogant claim that it is easy. The tutorial suggests that you consult your GPS device to help with the slope of your land. Please.You can also link to the Chief Architect website from the help menu for an additional example of sloping terrain. The website says that ""creating a...sloping terrain is easy...."" It ain't. In addition, various secrets need to be uncovered to prevent your split-level entry home from either sinking into the terrain or floating above it.The bottom line: if you live on flat land, buy this software, relax, and have fun. If you live on a sloped lot, you may still consider buying this software. But, be prepared for some considerable frustration."

90593,1,"Am longtime user of Microsoft Office. I admit it was frustrating at first to use this new system, but have been delighted overall. Really cool new features (or least now accessible to me): Outlook as nice feature of a to-do bar with just the next few appointments coming up to right of monthly calendar view. To do file management like delete/rename in Word open menu, (as opposed to going to to file manager), the real time resizing and recoloring of text as mouse passes thru the color and dropdown menus (as oposed to choosing, see if it works, go back to the size menu, choose, see if it works etc.). Their rational in going to the ribbons was that too many features were never discovered for use, and I do feel that as a power user my power is enhanced as I go through the ribbions by clicking on tabs at the top. Bottom line, for someone really into the esthetics of software and who is patient, this upgrade is probably for you. Otherwise the previous version will do nicely.P.S. If you've not download the free Microsoft Desktop search program, run to rather than walk to is my recomendation.James Warner, Seattle"

I don't understand why but that is one of my complaints.Another complaint would be that some things are incompatible. I couldn't burn a CD until I went to Adaptec website and downloaded a newer version which I have 90 free days and then have to shell out some more cash for it. Also, music match had to be updated.

DVD Builder, VideoWave, and the new PhotoSuite 7 are both definite improvements, as are the capture and storyboard features. However, I would like to focus on the degraded &quot;Creator Classic&quot; and the nearly unrecognizable Label Creator, which I use the most and have come to rely on. Instead of a general complaint, I will give examples. Here are some of the best features that have been screwed up in version 7:1. You can no longer right-click on the column attributes above the song titles. You are limited to Size, Type and Date Modified. In Creator Classic 6, you had could display the bit rate, duration of a song, track number, album name, etc., etc.2. Although you can still preview a song, it is a tiny little box with very limited features. You can no longer play several previews from the same player like you could in versions 4-6...another downgrade.3. I have also noticed that this version is much fussier with MP3 files. Nearly any bit rate would play in version 6. This one is hit and miss. A song that plays in your media player may come out with pops and defects after it is burned to CD.4. If you have an MP3 file with both the artist and song title, the artist name is dropped from the playlist. Kind of inconvient if you are making a compilation disc.5. If you decide to save your project and burn the disc later, good luck. The artist title will be automatically deleted from the Artist field, the Disc Title will also be deleted, and the playlist may or may not be shuffled and song titles may be substitued for others. Sounds like a major bug to me. This happened more than once to me. Another problem not found in previous versions.6. If you drag and drop more than one song title to a different location on your playlist, there's a pretty good chance that the program will shut down completely, and you can then start over again.Now, on to Label Creator.1. You now have options. Too too many options. Why should you have to CHOOSE whether you want the artist, track list and media type, as well as decide which of the 12 different options you want on the label? Isn't that overkill? What was wrong with the basic clicking of the &quot;CD Contents&quot; button and have it automatically display the track list?2. There is also the issue already mentioned by another reviewer of the label creator not allowing you to drag tracks line by line. The playlist is now in a block. You can't stretch song titles like you could in previous versions, and the songs will not display alpha-numerically.3. Last, how about a wizard to help you decide which of the 8 different layout options you want. What was wrong with the basic front, back and insert? Believe me, when it comes to labels, less is more.Well, that's my 10 cents about Roxio's new bloated bundle."
59181,2,"I've used Zone Alarm, Norton Internet Security and now [regretfully] McAfee Internet Security. McAfee Internet Security is cripled by its lack of information and capabilities. Norton's product is by far superior.The alert boxes nor activity log tell you the full details of the remote IP address or ports not anything about the local communication. This becomes important, because, you might be perfectly comfortable having Internet Explorer access a web site on port 80, but freak out if Internet Explorer was allowed to share you files with ""web folders"" on a different TCP/UDP port.In addition, data is displayed in hexadecimal format with no interpretation. Even as network professional, I don't have the binary format of IP packets memorized.My advice is to skip this product and go directly for Norton Internet Security."

Personally, I don't mind the lack of outlook as I use a (more secure) web-based service to handle my email needs anyway. I like the hard case packaging also. I think MS did a good job w/ Office 2007 and the home/student version has everything a typical person will need for home use."

56678,1,"I just upgraded to MSP6 and I love the new workflow and features. After a beta patch from some MUG users (MediaStudio Pro Users Group) I can output my video directly from my timeline without rendering. Very cool. And my DV project previews are flawless.(I use a SIIG 1394 card, PIII 500Mhz, 20GB.) Ulead's SmartRender technology works great on all my media. It's great to be at the final output, notice a screw-up, and just render the change before dumping out to tape. I've always liked this feature, but is seems to be even better now. I also use an ATI All-in-Wonder and capture MPEG-2 directly from some older tapes I have. The performance is like I'm working with a standard AVI, with a slight delay on dragging the timeline cursor (no biggy). The added Source window is very nice for multiple cuts from one source clip prior to dropping on the timeline. I like to scale my Source window down and increase my Preview window. Couldn't do that in Premiere. I've always liked the Production Library's clean &quot;windows explorer&quot; style format. The new audio crossfade tool is a real timesaver for the dialogue I cut together, as well as ambient noise. - What else can I say? For the buck . . . no, for any amount of bucks, MediaStudio is a top-notch product with a whole lot more than anyone else gives you.Fred C."
66568,0,"Daria's Inferno, much like Star Trek: Borg before it, lives up to Simon and Shuster Interactive's apparent credo of: &quot;Give them an easy, interactive episode to entertain them once or twice&quot;. If you missed Borg, it involved about 2 hours of playing time that could be watched as a ~40 minute &quot;movie&quot; when you were finished. Here, this is compressed for the MTV generation as about 1 hour of playing time for ~20 minutes of actual material. Guess they didn't want to worry about the second CD.Graphics in the game are about what you'd expect from a 2D animation heroine - although the backgrounds in the &quot;cut scenes&quot; noticably lack detail, and the repetitive reuse of Trent for level transitions gets annoying. There's only about 20 minutes of material on this CD, couldn't they at least put a change in there?Gameplay is, well.... insulting to Daria fans. This CD is marked as rated for teenagers 13+. Most Daria fans I've seen on the net are between 15 and 45 (I'm almost 30). The mindset needed for this game to be an actual puzzle would be about 5, however. Every object in the game has a use, but there are only about 30 total objects, almost all of which you literally CAN NOT miss. If their use weren't extremely obvious already (what would you try to do first with a garage door opener with a garage nearby, for example?) - the Sick Sad World segments spell it completely out for you. Kevin Thompson could beat this game in a day.I must admit that there is one challenge however -- not getting so irritated at the interface that you use the CD as a frisbee. Movement of Daria is controlled with either the keyboard arrow keys (with _no_ use of diagonals on the keypad) or the mouse. Unfortunately, application of items on &quot;irritants&quot; aka enemies is _also_ with the same mouse button. Miss by a pixel and you walk straight into what you were trying to negate. I guess this was needed for the Mac port (I know 2+ button mice for Macs _exist_ but they are an option, after all...).Setting aside the above -- is it worth it? Well, if you have a child of 5 or 6, sure. It's a fun little game. Otherwise, you _must_ be a fan of the show to enjoy this game. A rabid fan, possibly. There are gems for the fans, including an extended version of the show's theme &quot;You're Standing on my Neck&quot; by Splendora in the credits. Daria's comments throughout the game are also amusing, as is the storyline. As dream sequenceepisodes go, I'd rather have seen this plot than &quot;Depth Takes a Holiday&quot;."
32991,1,"You know, when I first picked up this game, when I was about 2 years old, I was a die-hard fan, and to this day, at 13, I still am. I found this game last month, layered in dust, because I was going through ""Sonic Withdrawl"", and remembered how hard it was when I was 2. I hesitated at first but decided to play it again. I was blown away! With an unlockable course and 6 unlockable characters, I could'nt put it down! I already beat it and unlocked Super Sonic O.O.This game is a MUST MUST MUST get for your Sonic die-hard fan!!!The graphics... not exactly ""awesome"" but it was great for the time!But either way; this is the ultimate Sonic PC game I've ever played.And, if you want to give your child a ""Sonic Holiday"" I stongly suggest you buy Sonic CD, also, BUT Sonic CD is NOT comatible with Windows XP!

I had so much fun playing this!!!Throughout the whole game, a yellow laptop fallows you and the other cluefinders around. When you click on it, it acsesses many things, like how to change the level of difficulty on a game, and it has info about the fellow clue finders. I love this game, I play everyday!"
82976,1,"I'm not familiar with this software, however, after reading and researching French products on Amazon I noticed a pattern that someone from Learn French Now company is peppering the customer reviews to steer people to their product.The same person writes reviews in all the French software. It's shameful.I wish Amazon had a way to stop this, must be a pretty desperate company to do this."
73396,1,"I would have given the product a 5 star review if it could have found the contents of the Lesson CD I copied to my laptop hard drive. You are forced to use the Lesson CD in the CD drive to work the program.The program is a very good learing tool. You learn to hear, read, speak and write in the language. The early lessons at first seem too easy, until you get to the unit that has you type in the words or phrases for the image you are viewing. That's when the learning starts. The advanced lessons will have you typing whole paragraphs.Better by far than any Berlitz programs etc. that you commonly find at a computer store.You won't truly learn a language until you can write in it. This one gives you a really good start!"

94585,1,"This software works just fine. But it lacks the kind of options that would make it even more useful. As an example, there is no simple way to ""temporarily"" disable it.You can't simply close it down. You can go to settings and either disable auto-protect, later reenabling it. Or you can disable running it at srattup and reboot. While these options get the job done, they are burdensome.In their attempt to make this product ""idiot-proof"", that have added complexities that make it annoying."
2646,0,"This is very much printing-oriented organizer. If you need to print your schedule, you are given the opportunity to choose from 250 layouts. But if, like me, you only need to use this organizer on your computer, you're stuck with only one layout. Only one font. Only one color of that font (black). Only one size on the font. Many less expensive organizers allow users to adjust the font, its size, color and frequently also background colors etc. to your taste and to your eyes. Not Anytime ""deluxe"".Also, you only can choose one timescale for all the days. If you want to start your schedule of activities at 7am and end at 6pm on weekdays and at 9am ending 10pm on weekends, you're out of luck. You're allowed only one timescale for all days. And if you choose 60 minutes between appointments, that's it. You can change it to 30 minutes or other interval later, but that will change those spaces for each and every hour of each and every day in the organizer. That's the weirdest and the most inconvenient arrangement I've ever seen.Anytime Deluxe 7.0 has 3 modules: Day Planner, Adress Book and simple Notebook. So don't expect any inventory, budgeting, or similar capabilities, present in many other more sophistcated but much cheaper organizers. One that comes to my mind is excellent shareware Agenda MSD, that sells for some $... and can be found on..."
91750,0,"I have been using Paperport for years. Each upgrade has added nice new features but also bugs. But the bugs were minor and I could live with them.Recently I received several ads in the mail and an email from Nuance to upgrade from v10 to 11. Ad sounded great and the price $99 was reasonable. So I figured ""what the heck."" Clicked on the email link to upgrade and takes me to a non-existing website. Typed in the website link from the mail ad, again, no website. Probably should have clued me in, but I went against my best judgement and called Nuance to buy the download.Installed the product. Registration didn't work smoothly but wasn't a big deal. Then I tried to scan a document. I checked the ""Capture Assistant"" box and clicked scan. Scanner does its thing then at the end of the first page, I get the famous Windows XP error box to report error to Microsoft. So I rebooted and tried again, without the Capture Assistant. Scanned my document OK this time. Sounds good, right?Wrong. I have an automatic document feeder (ADF) which allows me to scan both sides of a document (at least in previous versions of Paperort). Wtih v11, I can only scan both sides automatically if I use Capture Assitant. Except whenever I use it, it crashes. Now I cannot take advantage of my ADF and have to scan 2-sided docuements page by page manually! That would be fine for a couple of pages but a nightmare for a 10-page (20-sides) docuemnt. So I should contact customer support for help, right?Wrong again. You have to PAY for support. That would be fine it I'm don't know how to use the product and need a little guidance. But I SHOULD NOT have to pay to report software crashes. And what if I pay for help and they can't help me? Do I get my money back?I sincerely hope an update soon will fix my problem. But I doubt it will happen since very few people will pay to let Nuance know about these issues. And if they don't know about the bugs, they are unlikely going to fix them. Soon I will likely attempt to take advantage of my ""30-day money back guarantee"". Probably have to pay a fee for that too!"

46743,1,"I live in Idaho, and actually, really, go into the wilderness. The level of detail provided by garmin's u.s. topo offering is honestly not sufficient for accurately setting waypoints. National Geographic's state series is indeed sufficient (in fact it's the best for Idaho). Not to be cruel, but being able to download inadequately detailed map source is not nearly as important as being able to download truly accurate waypoints. Buying both packages would obviously be the best solution, but really you can set up all the detail you need (for getting in &amp; out) using just national geographic (whereas you can't with garmin's u.s. topo stuff).Critical note: I strongly recommend not carrying *just* electronic maps if you really, truly, go into wilderness. Electronic toys aren't foolproof - they break through no fault of your own, they get dropped, can get destroyed if you fall, etc. Paper maps should *also* be carried - ideally ones printed out just for your current trip.The garmin hardware itself is truly impressive. Their mapsource topo offerings, on the other hand, need a lot of work. It's as if the people who did them never visited the U.S., and/or never really went into many of the U.S.'s real wilderness areas."
14568,1,"This is a great product by Microsoft. I must say it's not worth the 159.99 upgrade from Fronpage 2000, if you own a previous version.You can add in animated buttons, animation, loads of cool things to spice up your images, and loads more. More than 50 amazing theme backgrounds and 12 awesome templates. Make a custom threaded(or non threaded, your choice) in less than 3 minutes!Other reviewers who claim Frontpage is bad because it needs server extensions just haven't explored the world wide web. Go to microsoft.com and download a free web server. Then just download the server extensions for that server, also from microsoft.com. Not too hard, is it?Remember NO editors out there can be used without ANY computer experience. You should know some basic HTML, then your prayers are answered.I used to use Shami's HTML-kit, but you had to write all the code yourself. Macromedia Homesite and Macromedia Dreamweaver...hmmm, I've tried them both. Homesite was pretty much the same as the FREE html-kit. You had to write the code! And Dreamweaver has a terrible environment for beginners and intermediate web developers alike.Frontpage is tops!!"
52263,1,I bought Quicken 2003 last fall. It is my first Quicken upgrade since I started with it in 1997. I was able to import all my old data without any trouble. The interface is different and it took just a little while to get used to it. I'm happy with the program now and use it every day to keep track of my small book business.
87370,1,"I bought this because online reviews stated it was the best and cheapest at converting any format movie to any format movie, and I was especially interested in converting movies to play on my EPSON P2000.The software does a great job at this, but it's not very intuitive. You have to be somewhat tech wise. There is no clear instructions and the help documentation is not robust at all. At times the Help doc only stated the obvious and provided no help at all. Think of it more as Glossary with some simple explanations. Grant it, I was trying to copy ""copyright coded"" movies which is more challenging (these were my movies that I purchased on DVD and wanted to watch them on my P2000...no violations were occuring here).Since I consider myself tech savvy, I was able to figure it out, but it took me a while and more online research. Once you figure it out however, the software is awesome and simple. For the average user, with no code cracking requirements, the software works great and converts any format to any format, and usually simply by selecting from a drop down menu the device you have...it sets all other features for you automatically. One issue here, some devices like the P2000, offer you alternatives in the drop downs menu, but the software doesn't tell you anything about the difference between selecting one over the other.Anyway, overall, I recommend this software to people who need to copy their movies, DVD or Home video, to their portable devices like P2000, Ipod video or PSP. I would not recommend buying this for Grandma assuming Grandma just discovered e-mail."
1664,1,"Encarta 2003 is the best encyclopedia yet! There are so many different features that allow you to see the world at the comfort of your own home.

There is also a book of quotations, a World Atlas, and Research and Learning Tools. The pictures of the various places makes you feel like your actually there. I feel really priveledged to have received an advanced copy of this amazing encyclopedia. I love this encyclopedia and will continue to use it to look up all the information I will need."

15799,2,"As a now professional writer, Final Draft 4, 5 and 6 got me through the early screenplays, I have grown very fond of the program - my major ""work tool"".Final Draft 7 is a disgrace. Not only will you be wasting your money on an unusable product, you will spend hours of your time downloading and installing updates that fail, trying to optimise and ""learn"" a program that will let you down. I am actually amazed that a program that is so close to Version 6 (really, the only addition is the split screen thing...)is so far from that version in terms of stablity. What is up with this?We are talking about a program that is a BASIC word processor tailored to screen and stage writing - this isn't a complex 3d game!My strong advice is that if you feel you have to start with Final Draft, then purchace Version 6. (Still avalible - how many companies would keep an outdated version of their software on that market?) Otherwise look at the competitors."

49342,1,"I have been reading these reviews for a while and wondering whether or not I should upgrade my laptop PC to Vista. Would I be an upgrade success story, or would I be one of the disgruntled reviewers whose PC now performs like a chimp? There was only one way to find out. I bought my laptop about a month before Vista was released, so I was entitled to order a free upgrade of Home Premium from Toshiba. I made the order one day, faxed my proof of purchase the day after, and my upgrade DVD arrived two weeks later. I am satisfied with how fast they sent me the package. Anyway, back to Vista. I'd read the reviews, took the good comments with the bad ones, used the Vista Upgrade Advisor, which told me all of my hardware was compatible with Vista and that I'd have to remove some software and drivers. I did everything I was told. All I had to do now was keep my fingers crossed and hope for the best.The upgrade DVD contained a link to an exe file that launched a help wizard that would guide me through updating my BIOS and removing incompatible drivers before launching the Vista installation. (I did an upgrade, not a clean install.) I didn't have to do anything -- just let the wizard uninstall the programs and reboot the computer when necessary. It involved no intervention on my part. Then came the actual installation of Vista. It was quick and painless (one hour), no blue screens of death or lockups. So far, so good.When Vista launched, things were a little crazy at first, with the OS recognizing new hardware and Toshiba's help wizard installing the new drivers. Things went a little awry at this point because the help wizard stayed stuck on a driver that wouldn't install. It would reboot and try to install the same driver again when it should have moved on to the next one. So I exited the wizard and decided to install the drivers myself (I had already saved most of them on a CD). Installing most of those drivers hadn't been necessary after all, for Microsoft had already installed most of those drivers anyway. The OS felt clunky at first, which meant some intervention was needed. I removed some applications from startup, managed the gadgets on my sidebar, and tweaked it around until Vista worked for my needs. It now runs smoothly. Despite my laptop having only 1 GB of RAM, it purrs like a kitten. Sometimes the OS is a resource hog, but not enough to render the PC useless.I haven't had much opportunity to use all of it and take advantage of its features, but this is what I like so far:* The interface. It's actually prettier than the Mac OS X (which I also own). The aero glass is very easy on the eye. I also like the 3-D flip and live thumbnails on the taskbar. I like the look of the Alt + Tab thumbnails much more than the ones on Windows XP.* The search bar on the Star menu. Of course, we already have that on Mac OS X, but it's nice to finally have it on Windows as well. I'm lazy and I don't like to have to look for stuff so this tool is very useful and attractive for me.* I like that it's more multimedia friendly than previous versions, including Windows XP Media Center Edition. I am able to burn DVDs and CDs and create movie montages with much more ease. (Though this tool is user-friendlier on the Mac.)* I like Windows Mail. It looks nicer and seems more secure than Microsoft Outlook.* It seems more secure. Windows Defender comes bundled with the OS now. I hope this OS can resist malware a little better than its predecessor.* The names of the processes running on the task manager are much clearer now. You get the names of the software and not just jargon like ehtray.exe, which you don't know what it is unless you google it.* Network connections are much easier to handle. My laptop now picks up on my home network the moment the computer boots up. I had to look for the connection and sign on with XP, but now I can go straight to browsing the Internet with Vista.There are, like all Windows OSs, cons as well:* I detest the whole Cancel/Allow thing. They ask me whether I want access to something I've just clicked on! Windows has gone from cautious to downright paranoid. The Cancel/Allow feature could be an useful tool in case an unwanted application tries to access my computer, but prompting me every time I click on a program, and a program I've clicked on numerous times at that, is just annoying as hell. Ugh.* I didn't like the huge desktop icons. So I right-clicked and switched to classic view.* I was lucky to find an anti-virus software that is compatible with Vista and that uses flawless real-time protection gratis (Avast! Antivirus), but I haven't been lucky finding a compatible third-party firewall. Neither Comodo Firewall Pro nor ZoneAlarm (free or pro), my two favorite firewalls, in that order, has released a Vista ready product. (They both claim to be working on it.) I am stuck using Windows Firewall for now. And I refuse to use Norton or McAfee Internet suites. They are resource hogs and overhyped products. Also, I've heard they are buggy with Vista.* This OS still comes with the typical Windows nuisances that I hate, like leaving folders and registry keys after uninstalling a program. I had hoped they'd found a way to fix that, but no suck luck. I still have to manually remove program leftovers. I guess Macs will always be far cleaner than PCs in that regard.* This ""innovation"" doesn't feel so innovative when you've been using most of the same features for years now. Mac OS X has had all of this stuff for a long time now, so the ""Wow!"" factor doesn't apply to me. As usual, instead of feeling that Microsoft has created something unique, I feel more like they have finally caught up with everything else that is out there, not only with Mac and Linux, but with other companies like Google and Mozilla.That is all the insight I have for now. I will edit the review as I continue to use it. All in all, Windows Vista is a vast improvement from previous installments and it's lovely eye candy to boot. I love to be ahead of technology and I'm relieved to finally have this on my laptop. (And even more relieved that I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it.) I know I'll be repeating this whole process again with the release of Leopard for my MacBook Pro. I also have Ubuntu, Kubuntu and DreamLinux to play around on Live CDs. I love seeing what is out there. As for potential buyers/upgrade hopefuls, all I can say is if you want to upgrade to Vista, give it a whirl. Don't let the negative reviews scare you -- instead, you should learn from their experiences. Use some common sense, from the best of your abilities at least, and make sure to use the upgrade advisor before you install it. Good luck! :)"
21419,0,"Well, kids are different, aren't they? My 5-year-old liked playing cards against the computer to match the dinosaur parts, he liked seeing his dinosaurs appear on the various gameboards, and he liked the &quot;prizes&quot; which were coloring pages he could print out. It IS repetitive, but often kids this age like repetition. I wouldn't say it's highly educational about dinosaurs, but just as we don't have only one kind of book in our collection, we have a variety of software. I can tell my son enjoyed mastering this game."
45984,1,"I had used StarOffice 5.2a before and was really disgusted by it even though it enable me to view Microsoft documents over UNIX boxes.However, 6.0 is a **major** improvement over 5.2a and it's performance even on a PC is amazing.It doesn't emulate desktop and offers a fast,fully-featured Document Processing application.There is no comparision between 5.2a and 6.0 version of StarOffice.It looks like and works like a commercial application!I found no formatting problems between Microsoft Word documents opened in StarOffice.(i.e basic one, not containing any macros etc.)I would recommend it any one who want to use a fully featured word processing applicaton without any un-unused bell and whistels of MS-Office."

32762,1,"I used the Garmin Mapsource Worldmap in Cameroon, Africa. It was a blessing to have and compare with printed maps available. We always knew where we were, which made us feel good. The maps are off a little bit from where the GPS thought we were (less than 1/2 a mile at most) and some roads were different, but given the conditions in Cameroon everyone on the trip was extremely happy we had the Garmin 60Csx and the worldmap loaded and operating at all times."
59854,2,"I bought this pile of garbage and am as mad as hell about it. I bought it to build a web site to publish my photographs in a gallery. I went to all the expense of buying it, spent days and days building the site (which is not as intuitive as you might hope) to finally get a site which looked pretty good from my PC. I published it on the web and then discovered IT DOESN'T DAMN WELL WORK WITH ANY BROWSER OTHER THAN INTERNET EXPLORER. Exchanged phone calls and emails with Microsoft guys in India and the final word - yep, the gallery function doesn't work with other browsers and there is nothing you can do.I really feel ripped off."

58291,0,I am 11 years old and I love Nancy Drew. After getting the third one I relized that it could have been better. One problem is that when you want to go to a different building you have to switch disks and I thought that was horrable. Certain things don't work until the end when you are just about finished. So really I did not like it.
20710,1,"Spanish Now is the best language learning software out there for Spanish right now. I've tried many of the other ones and found this one to be the best. Their games, videos, audio and content top anything else out there. They don't over emphasize anyone part of learning Spanish so it makes for a very well rounded educational product. My adivce to you is buy this if you are looking to learn Spanish for any reason."

The sequel is almost exactly the same as the original except for much more features including dinosaur, and other new theming.

Also, some rides even have new features like a loop on the wooden coaster and many new scenarios to make this game the best simulation game on earth!"

28736,1,"This is the first home planning software I've ever bought. I found most of it difficult to use until I got accustomed to the program. There are some features I wish it had such as more 'undo' options and more home plans. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known beforehand that it only had 20+/- of it's own house plans that you could alter. Several other similar programs boast 100's of home plans that you can alter to your tastes. Regardless, it's a good program if you want to be able to &quot;build&quot; your home, design the interior, and landscape the outside and fairly simple to use."

46757,1,"Apple announced that Intel core duo processors will be used in the new range of Macs. Hardware developers and programmers and just about everyone else ask what is stopping OSX from running on a non-apple computer with Intel processors... turns out that there was not much except for some code in the OSX software. Then somebody changes the code in the fall of 2005. Now everyone who wants to see and use OSX before they buy gets VMware, obtains a copy of OSx86 and boots the latest Mac OS on Windows or Linux. This is not dual booting. VMware is virtualization software. Modern hardware is fast enough to run other Operating Systems at 75% or above speed at the same time. Seeing OSX running on Windows or Linux will have eyes open wide in the room around you. For Mac users who have shelled out their hard earned cash on a Mac, seeing this reaches down into the very depth of the soul. Apple announces a new boot camp that allows Macs to dual boot Windows, but not virtualize it. Back in the 80s - 90s there was good reason to own Mac hardware. In the 21st century all hardware companies are mostly using third world sources to build their components. So in terms of Mac hardware versus clone PCs, there is not much difference anymore. OSx86 booting on a non-apple computer is the biggest event in the history of Apple Macintosh. It will make you think.OSX is great. For anyone who has booted Linux or FreeBSD can see the advantages of having a desktop that is better than Gnome or KDE. That is OSX. Beneath OSX is a type of FreeBSD-like system. That is a UNIX-like system. Mac software does cost money though. There isn't much more to this topic other than the above. This is the current model of thought when it comes to OSX. There are many in denial that OSx86 exists. The development is that significant. Just learn about it. Then consider your next move."
60533,0,"I purchased several of these for me and for gifts. I tried installing the program and received errors right from the start. I uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times and each time did the online update as suggested. Still I received errors. When I contacted customer service online, it was suggested that I visit their troubleshooting page online. I did that and one of the errors I received was not listed. I recontacted the customer service person and was told to uninstall and reinstall the program (which I had already informed them that I had done). All of a suddent, I am not getting the errors anymore, but when I click on the DVO icon to open the program, nothing pops up on my screen. Their customer service person said to call them between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. MST. I am at work during those hours, so I would never be able to call them to get the problems resolved."
88571,1,My 4 year older daughter loves this game. She is learning and doesn't realize it. The game forces you to think about what needs to be done to complete tasks and has games along the way. Some of the games are just fun and some teach as well.
29425,1,"Physicus is a Myst-like game with a vague plot, no dialog, lots of solitude, no dying, and a bunch of great puzzles. In short, it's just what I like. I don't know if it's really a five-star - more like 4.5 - but it's one of the best games I have played in recent memory.***NavigationFirst-person, clumsy slideshow navigation, with lots of going forward several clicks until you can turn around. You can click pretty fast through it, though, so it's not a real big hardship.****GraphicsNice fantastical setting, although not what you'd expect of a world that isn't revolving.***SoundSome ambient sounds are missing, like jiggling door handles, but most of the sound is appropriate and not annoying. Music is not bad, but there isn't a lot of it, and I am not going to look for the soundtrack. There aren't many voices - just a narration at the beginning and the end, and the narration of the ""laptop"" study guide - but they were pleasingly British.-----StoryNot really applicable. There is not much to it, which is great for me, but other gamers seem to like a more involved plot.******PuzzlesSensible, logical, not too hard, and all are solvable if you study your ""laptop"" and pay attention to the clues, which are not hard to find. Some light math is required (love it).***GameplayThis game is awfully linear, and I did get stuck wondering where to go next, so I found a no-spoiler walkthrough that only told you what order to do things. This saved a lot of running around. [Thanks, Lora]*****PerformanceI had trouble at first, with the disk spinning up all the time. Everything on the web said that this was a two-disk game with a full-install option. Well... mine came on one disk and had no such options. I ended up using Daemon Tools to mount an image to my hard drive and everything went well after that. The screen settings offered a full screen option, and all was well.This will be a good game for fans of Myst and Schizm. Syberia fans will not like it as much."

71313,0,"This is my first experience with notation software. Perhaps my expectations were a little high. Bottom line, the HyperScribe (Notate As You Play) feature is useless. There's no problem with my equipment e.g., computer, keyboard, or MIDI Interface. The software isn't capable of reproducing 'real time' play. Talk about ""Lost in Translation!"" Uploading data from floppy disk, CD, or a Flash Card is better, but far from acceptable. I've also tried to load music directly from the hard drive. Regardless the media used to interface with this program, your song won't come close to sounding the way you want. Get ready to spend countless hours editting your song. Even then, it won't reproduce audibly the way it's written. I'll take the hit for trying to make sheet music inexpensively, but SongWriter doesn't live up to the hype -- at all. It's fun to play with, but don't expect too much. Save your money & time. Incidentally, the problem isn't with the users. Between us, my wife & I have over ninety-years music experience."

52909,1,"If you want to be like the majority of Americans who have taken a foreign language in high school or college and can hardly decipher a word of conversational French then Smart French is not for you. On the other hand, if you feel that the value of learning a foreign language is to understand NATIVE speakers and hear the language as it is actually spoken then Smart French is a MUST buy. This program will completely demystify the art to French spoken language--and it is an art. When I heard my first lesson I honestly felt betrayed by my other programs--why didn't they simply tell the truth about French pronunciation like Smart French does? That is why if you have had years of instruction or not even one French lesson this program will benefit you.You get a booklet with the written dialogues, the alphabet, and helpful pronunciation tips. You also get a a CD software program which effortlessly takes you through a rich library of interesting conversations. You can watch the video and audio together or listen to the audio alone. The secret to Smart French is that it breaks it down for you--lesson by lesson. One of the most important things in learning a language is to utilize your listening skills--something that had always terrified me until Smart French. Go through each dialogue step by step and you will lose your fear and finally gain the confidence to trust your ears. Then pick up your old language books, tapes, and French movies and you will be amazed when you finally understand the speech patterns. I highly recommend this program--ENJOY!"
39326,1,Works well but its way overpriced. why would u buy a GPS that doesnt come with maps preinstalled anyways.
67756,0,"First let me say, this program did make everything relatively easy for me. I was up and going in little time, and the book does a pretty good job of helping you out. But then I learned of the software's largest, almost unforgiveable problem. No support for the ability to add instrument definitions!... What is an instrument definition? It is sort of like a computer driver, you add it into the program so that the software recognizes (communicates) with all of the sound banks (beyond general midi) on your instrument. I was INCREDIBLY frustrated to learn, after much searching, and waiting several days for a reply from Cakewalk's tech support, to learn this fact, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MANUAL SAYS YOU CAN DO IT!!, it even gives you directions how. So for the time being (until I can save money for one of the better programs) I can ONLY use boring old general midi, making 5/6th's of my synth's sound bank useless.My final opinion, if you are using anything besides KORG or Roland hardware, which are the only ones preprogrammed into the software (I use Alesis), go with Home Studio '02, or better yet, XL."
71237,1,"I have used this program in 3 Linux versions as well as windows 98.I beleive this is the best program i have used in a long time.It out surpasses most of windows programs of the same caliber.of course it is a free program for Linux users if installed on the Linux version they choose or want to go to their ftp site todownload it.However,I would suggest getting their Cd for those of you who are not familiar with the downloading procedure.One of the aspects I like ,Is the ability of several office type programs.also the explorer which allows you to use it as a web surfer.ALL in aLL I think Sun has always outdone themselves again.Their Program does just about anything one could ask for.one note though,It has to be confighured correctly to use it.Read the instructions very carefully and all will go well.You will not be disatisfied ."
47075,0,"I tried this product yesterday and it did a pretty good job at callibrating my monitor. It very easy to use and the instructions provided are easy to understand. The software that comes on the CD is not compatible with Windows Vista, but I was able to download an upgrade from the Pantone site which had support for Vista. I had problems with continuous callibration (which callibrates the monitor based on changing light conditions). The continuous callibrations caused my monitor to get a pinkish tinge which I didn't like. So I had to reset it and re-callibrate and this time I didn't choose continuous callibration. Due to this problem I will give it 3 instead of 4 out of 5."

56654,0,"I bought this for my 6 yr. old grandson who just completed kindergarten. However, his favorite activity in kindergarten was computer lab so I decided to give him the opportunity to use a computer at home. I purchased Reader Rabbit 1st Grade. My opinion about the program is mixed.It's worst problem is that it is very difficult to navigate. There is no documentation supplied with the program and there is no top menu provided. It is difficult to control. I am considered a computer whiz with almost 50 yrs. experience and one of my degrees is a Masters in Computer Science. Still I had numerous problems navigating. Fortunately, my grandson who seems to have an instinct for computers and who is very persistent found out how to maneuver. He is great on trial and error.The program is not a teaching device. It doesn't teach anything. The student must already know how to do the work before using the program but it is a great refresher program. My grandson fell in love with the program. He worked five hours straight until he completed the program and then he wanted to do it all over again. The problem was that the program would not let him start all over again. Because the program has a memory for the work that the student has completed, when the student completes the program, all the student can do is to see the ending show. I spent almost an hour working around it. Uninstalling and reinstalling the program did not work. I finally had to create a new user account for my grandson so that he could play.Although my grandson just completed kindergarten he is actually ready for the Second grade so he had no problems doing the work in the program. The program itself is not all encompassing of what pupils may learn in the First Grade. What a pupil will learn in the First Grade depends on the school. Reader Rabbit went about half way. The math is not as advanced as the local First Grade would have it and digraphs are not as extensively used in Reader Rabbit as some children will find in schoolOne other annoyance is that when the program installs it does not copy the files from the CD to the hard drive so that each time it is used, the CD must be inserted into the CD-ROM drive, making it harder for a child to start the program.Also, some of the segments are so long they become boring in repetition. And there is way too much story telling which keeps the user from getting to the meat quickly."

I used Word to write them.Now that I am in older, I am learning that following the traditional Hollywood script conventions make sense now that I am sending my work to scriptwriting contests, etc.I got Final Draft because all my friends said it was 'what everybody used'. Normally, I would resist following this kind of advice, since I've always thought of myself as not being like everyone else & not following the crowd - but it was correct in this case.Scripts are literally flowing out of me now.Watch out Oscar, save one for me!"

I've used it about a year now and am very satisfied.My family and friends are scattered across the United States. Weatherbug lets me check the current weather, forecast, current radar and lots of other stuff for six places other than my own. It feels kind of nice to be able to check on what the grandparents and college buddies are having for weather each day."

25833,1,"As a fellow reviewer commented on Symantec's rebate performance... They are very cryptic about the requirements to claim your rebate. They want your old disk or for you to deface your old manuel but they don't tell you this until you open the sealed box and see all rest of the terms and conditions that you must meet to claim your rebate. When ever this situation arises with any company:1) I complete the forms and send the required proof of purchase of their product and then2) I write them a little note and tell them that they CAN NOT change the terms of sale after the sale by hiding additional requirements with in the sealed box. Further I call to their attention that the Rebate was an inducement to the customer to buy the product and I accepted their inducement to buy the product at face value; expecting the exterior inducement to containe the full and complete trems and conditions of the sale3)I also tell them that the property they want me to send in or deface is my property, bought and paid for by me and I will not submitt nor deface my property. The property that they request is mine to retain and use as I please4)Send the rebate within the advertised 4 to 6 weeks or send me a check for the total purchase price including sales tax and the estimated return shipping charges5)And that I enjoy being aggressive and a problem, try me you will not like the results.I always get my rebated within 4 to 6 weeks. Don't let them mess with you. Symentec is generally hard to deal with on other issues but not on the Rebate issue, if you are aggressive to start with. Never argue over a point that you know you can not win."

9546,1,Very enjoyable DVD. Excellent instruction on chess planning. Easy to understand. Obviously there are some people who can't stand the fact that women like Polgar and Shahade are better than them so they go around writing bogus bad 1 star review.

These people obviously haven't got a clue as to how to set up Norton Personal Firewall. It's so easy it's childs play!Norton have great on-line support and the one small item I queried was answered completely and to my asatisfaction.The only thing I will say is that you MUST remove all traces of the old program before installing the new one or there will be some conflict while the new product looks for traces of pirated Norton material.If at first you don't succeed, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!"
36188,1,I've been using beyond tv since version 3.5 and I love it. I've never had any real problems with it and they keep adding great features like being able to make podcasts from TV shows you record (love not having to pay to get TV shows on my ipod/zune) and drive pooling so your management of storage is minimal.I have found that the beefier the system the better your results will be. I started with a lower end system and everything worked but I missed out on some of the stuff like the transparent overlays and such. But now I have a bigger system (by no means top of the line) and I get all the benefits of the software.
77641,1,"I bought a new Dell computer that came loaded with Sonic's Record Now Deluxe. I had used Easy CD Creator 5.0 Basic for years, quite happily. However, I HATED the Record Now program. It wouldn't do half of what I wanted it to do, and I was frustrated all the time.Of course, Easy CD Creator 5.0 wouldn't work with Windows XP...so I had to make some decisions. After reading all the reviews, I was very skeptical about using Roxio's Easy Media Creator...but I figured I could always return it to Amazon if I had any problems with it.Well, folks...I COULDN'T BE MORE THRILLED WITH THIS PROGRAM!!! It loaded like a dream...and it does all that I want it to do and more!!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!The only problem I had was that after I had loaded it, my CD burner wouldn't work!! But all I had to do was to go to Roxio's support website, I located the problem (my Samsung CD burner needed a firmware update, which Roxio's technical support site lead me right to, with complete instructions on how to fix it), I downloaded the firmware upgrade, and everything works like a charm!Plus...the LP and Tape Assistant is ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!! I have hundreds of old cassettes that I can't locate on CD's. I simply went to the local Radio Shack today and bought a connector. I didn't even have to hook my computer up to my stereo...I just used a portable cassette player...and everything works perfectly! I'm so happy about being able to convert my cassettes to CD...I can't even tell you!!!I don't know why everyone else is so unhappy with this program...I LOVE IT...and if you read my other reviews, you'll realize that I'm a harsh critic.Please don't hesitate to purchase this software. I believe you'll be as happy as I am!!!"

3850,1,I just returned from a 6000 mile trip using the S/T 2008. I too had a little trouble with the activation as I was not near WiFi most of the time but once I got a good connections it worked.In general it worked well. I did laugh when a huge lake in BC did not show up on one side of the road I was traveling beside. It is hard to read a lot of the small type in the car. Looking for the different colors of the minuscule blocks to see which was a restaurant and which was a bank was a problem. GPS reception can be spotty even when it appears it should be ok. On one or two occasions it did confuse left and right but the map was there to confirm.All in all though it bailed me several times when I had know idea where I was in rural BC. It also got me through Vancouver and Seattle with no hassles. I also love being able to save my trip plans and reuse them again.

47516,2,"The version of this DVD was not compatible with any of my PCs or laptops, which I guess explains why it was so cheap. I should have read more closely (if it was even listed anywhere), what operating systems the DVD worked on, but it was very old OS's that aren't even supported anymore. I can't use the DVDs so I can't rate the content."
89565,1,"Windows NT has not had a major upgrade in years, and was missing valuable features available on other operating systems like Windows 98. Windows 2000 absolutely gives the business Windows platform new life. For the business user it is loaded with practical features and ease-of-use enhancements. For the IT department, it's pretty hands-off. The addition of USB was welcome, and I'm starting to discover the practicality of USB for small, portable devices like ZIP drives and scanners. The hibernate feature is extremely practical since it gets you back to work within seconds of bootup.A few strange comments from others that I want to address. First, Linux is an excellent OS, but it is not the answer for every user any more than Win2000 is. There are more apps for Linux every day, but many of the apps that you already use are not available there. If you are unsure that Windows is the proper platform for you, investigate Linux (or Mac for that matter). Also, Windows 2000 is absolutely for business users. It works best on a business network, and some of the features are not appropriate for home use. For home, Windows98 or ME are good choices for the person who wants Windows.Finally, Mr. Small wrote another review where he shows that he knows not of what he speaks. No, Mitchell, Windows File Protection (WFP) is not at all related to Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) in NT. The NT HAL is the interface between NT and your hardware. WFP tries to keep rogue apps from destroying important files. This has been a sore point with NT and Windows 9X for quite a long time. Some older programs may not work properly with Windows 2000 and may need upgrades. This is to be expected, and is intended to protect your computer from poorly written applications. In many cases, these applications could damage Windows NT, causing lockups and other unwanted behavior. Windows 2000 tries to prevent this."

I SAW THIS FILM WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED, AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED.THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY A GOOD ADAPTATION OF A VIDEO GAME(PROBABLY THE FIRST TO GET IT RIGHT). SUPER MARIO BROS. AND DOUBLE DRAGON WERE MADE INTO MOVIES, BUT FAILED MISERABLY. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GOOD AND THE CHARACTERS WERE NOT CARDBOARD.THE ACTING WAS PRETTY GOOD AS WELL. LINDEN ASHBY AS JOHNNY CAGE WAS THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE FILM. CHRISTOPHER LAMBERT, AS THE WISE BUT SARCASTIC LORD RAYDEN, GAVE A VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE ALSO. CARY TAGAWA,I FELT, OVER DID HIS PERFORMANCE AS THE EVIL SORCERER SHANG TSUNG, BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT THE MOVIE TOO MUCH. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT......GET IT!!!"

While I always enjoy new bells and whistles on any new software, I am so glad that the fundamental elements of this software have been enhanced to make it more user-friendly. Even if you are not technologically inclined, this software can be used as soon as you open it up. My kids (4 and 2 years old) love making relational charts. We made an animals one after we came home from the zoo. It is great for teaching relationships as well as organizational thinking."

60261,1,SuseLinux 10.0 is one of the most user friendly and beautifulversions of Linux. The hardest thing was to configure the DHCP client settings to get it online. That only too a couple of minutes.Suse has got eye candy that the other OS could only hope for and it's got the power to boot. All you'll ever need and more. Stuff you wouldn't buy cause it didn't justify the cost comes standard.You can try those things you've been hearing about. Don't forget Suse comes pre loaded with Frozen bubble that alone makes it worth it. Got to love Linux it's M-P-P-BMore Power Per Buck. I won't rave on you can download the evaluation version and try it for free then the thing will sell itself. Linux gives you back your computer If privacy is your concern this is the 1-4-U.Happy Days!
36161,0,"Album delivers all of the basic features you would expect from such a product with some minor weaknesses and some nice surprises. The Fix function is a bit weak, even compared to some free programs. Specifically, the lighten/darken feature is a bit weak and AutoFix does not seem to make any significant improvements to photos. The backup feature is very easy to use but it requires a new CD each time, even if you are doing incremental backups and only bakcup a small number of files. This is wasteful and is a weakness. The photo Move and Rename features also add a lot of value and work well."

87326,0,"Dear Broderbund:I am in a computer training program and we just installed Mavis Beacon 12 in our computers (7 in our lab). My first complaint is the fact that we have to leave the computer disk in the disk reader in order to be able to use Mavis Beacon. If you take the disk out of the tower, even though you have downloaded the disk,Mavis is not there to call up and use.Another complaint is the rule about 2 spaces between sentences is not followed. Mavis consistently has only 1 space between sentences. This is a little irritating to say the least.Also, it takes a lot of time for a game to come up. You spend a lot of time looking at a black screen and you lose your momentum.I do enjoy using Mavis Beacon to improve my typing skills and speed but feel these problems should be addressed.Thank you for your time."
74196,2,"I have been a user of Norton products for over eight years (and have installed the latest version each new year), so you can imagine my disappointment when I installed Norton Internet Security 2005, the latest version, and it slowed my computer to a point of extreme frustration. This new version clearly has so many new ""features"" that it has transcended from being ""great, quality software"" to ""out of this world""... and that is exactly where it belongs. If it won't even run at an acceptable speed on a year old computer, it isn't worth running. Stick with Norton 2004, that's what I am going to do.Thumbs WAY DOWN on this one."
58976,1,"I've been using Bryce since it was ported to Windows at version 2.0. My impressions were, this is great but I can spend a brief eternity waiting for it to render. As features were added and stability was addressed we get to Bryce 5 which does a nice job of creating interesting 3D images. Created to be a nature designer Bryce 5 offers import and texture mapping of several 3D objects. This is important as it's nice to sometimes add buildings, animals or humans to pictures you design. The modeling tools are designed for natural scene creation but it is easy to create indoor scenes, 2D style studies and combinations of styles.The renderer is excellent with many options for developing your world. Bryce's interface has always been unique but intuitive. Still you will want to read the bland manual. After market books are poor to acceptable - beware of books depending on you purchasing modeling packages or 3D clip art.The animation options are acceptable for a program in this price range but aren't really suitable for much more than short clips, say 5 to 30 seconds. Even with a very fast, highly tweaked computer Bryce can crawl when rendering.Some solutions are to keep your animations simple and turn off the antiailising, on smaller frame sizes it is harder to notice and saves between 20 to 60% of render time. If developing stills make your picture slightly larger and don't use antiailising, go into your favorite graphics editor and resize. You will get faster renders and usually no jagged edges. For fun and small projects Bryce is great. It is priced to be appealing to the home user that isn't necessarily an artist but will certainly learn as they compose and develop scenes and animations.Bryce 5 is getting old and lacking in many modern features including the inability to take advantage of modern processors. Still, it is fun to work with and can create some of the most realistic landscapes or abstracts you can imagine. Bryce 5 expects little from the user, even it's learning curve is simple, especially for a 3D program, and has impressive results. Because of it's slow renderer it is not really a good professional solution although pro quality landscaping tools for high quality 3D programs cost three times Bryce's price and demand a general purpose 3D program well into the high hundred dollar to multi-thousand dollar solution.If you were curious what you could do in the visual arts but currently don't have the talent you can realize many of your ideas in Bryce 5. Much of 3D graphics have more to do with physics than artistic skills. If you are good at visualizing Bryce 5 is an excellent and modest costing program."
71402,1,"When I was a child, my parents had an 8mm movie camera which they brought with them on our family vacations and pulled out of the closet at prom time. It did not record sound or have any special effects. All you got was a silent movie and to watch it you had to drag out that clumsy projector and movie screen.Well, today's family lives in a different world and DVD video is one of the best by-products of this high-tech age. Adobe Premiere Elements 2 is the perfect software package for the amateur to intermediate level filmmaker who wants to save cherished moments of family and friends and add to their DVD's that professional presentation. Premiere Elements is a simple-to-use software with a user-friendly workspace and powerful video editing features. The context sensitive How To panel, tutorials and Product Help file quickly get you up and running the automated, drag and drop features.Your first step is to import your video clip into Premiere Elements and the Media Downloader makes this easy. You can import files from most digital video devices and preview each clip in the Monitor panel. Of course, to get that professional look, you will want to trim and combine several video clips together to make your movie. This is done quite easily by dragging your mouse. The software will automatically remove the unwanted part and reconnect the remaining. Once you get the movie edited to your liking, it is time to add some of the many pre-installed filters, transitions and special effects. Premiere Elements comes packed with a great number of customizable, Hollywood-style special effects that you can add to your clips. If you are familiar with any of the Adobe software, you will recognize some of these more popular special effects.A transition is a quick and easy way to smoothly tie together the scenes that make up your movie. You will find many professional quality video transitions to choose from including Gradient Wipe, Image Mask, 3D Motion, Page Peel, Slide and Wipe. Each transition has a thumbnail animation that shows how the effect will look and to apply any of them, you just drag it from the Effects and Transitions panel to the spot on the Timeline where you want the transition to occur. You also have many artistic effects to choose from including Alpha Glow, Bevel Edge, Drop Shadow, Edge Feather, Lens and Flare Distortion. All of these transitions and effects can be used as is or customized in the Properties panel and saved for future use. Unlike those family movies from my childhood, Premiere Elements has great Dolby Digital audio support. Using the Media panel, you can easily create an audio track and keyframes for coordinating the music along the Timeline.When I use my DVD recorder to burn the DVD after I tape my favorite TV shows, all I get is a generic looking menu with a bunch of ugly squares representing the scenes. With Premiere Elements, you can do a much better job using the many predesigned templates from the DVD Templates panel. You can choose from theme-related templates such as Entertainment, Seasons, Sports, Travel and Party Celebrations. Once you choose a template to match the theme of your movie, you can easily change the text and graphics and add style with the many text styles in the Titler Styles panel. If you can use a word processing program like Microsoft Word, you will have no problem customizing your menu from the templates.Now that you have your masterpiece completed, you will want to preview your movie in the Preview DVD panel or on your television. And because nothing has been finalized yet, you can go back to make refinements. Finally, you are ready to burn your DVD. Premiere Elements automatically chooses the best quality settings to match your media and the Project Archiver stores all the project media files in one place for you. You can burn your DVD to a single-layer or dual-layer disc in the PAL (Europe and Asia) or NTSC (America and Japan) formats.Adobe Premiere Elements 2 can be purchased alone or bundled with Adobe Photoshop Elements 4."
12194,1,"I've been using XP Home on various machines for three years, simultaneously with Linux, and it's enough time to say that XP has been excellent while Linux was just so-so.Some of the reasons why I love Windows XP:1. It is amazingly stable. Do you remember Windows 95/98 that were crashing several times a day? It does not happen with XP anymore. At the beginning, in 2001, the Internet Exporer was rather unstable and it had to close many times a week. Such things simply do not happen to me anymore, as a result of the updates that have been done. I am getting the blue screen roughly once a year, and it is never unexpected because I almost always do something controversial.2. It is getting very secure. The Service Pack 2 made the XP the safest affordable operating system. You know, operating systems are not created by God, and therefore there can be holes in them. The same is true about Windows. But Microsoft is a very active company and the hotfixes are available very quickly if it is necessary. The number of bugs that have survived is very small.3. XP is compatible with all previous software I tried - including very old-fashioned games that used to run under MS-DOS. Although XP is based on the technology of Windows NT/2000 Kernel, which was more stable, it became compatible with the systems 95/98/ME for the home users. XP also works with all modern games and other programs, as well as all external devices, that I've tried.4. XP is very configurable. I've changed the icons of everything - every folder and every file type, as well as all the sounds. It is also very user-friendly, and international support works smoothly.5. In the case that something goes wrong, it is still very likely that ""System Restore"" will save you. It's a time machine that can return all system files on your PC to a moment (checkpoint) in the past. It has been useful several times to fix various small problems with the configurations that appeared because of new programs I installed."

11306,0,"I bought this tool to download pictures from my phone without having to buy another feature from my wireless phone company.This product does that. I gave it 3 stars because you have to have the right combination of turning on the phone, pluging in the cable, starting the computer, specifying where the cable is plugged in, for the software to work.Specifically, the automatic detect (which detects which computer port the cable is connected to) doesn't work, and you have to go through your computer system, figure out the port name, and specify it in the software.Then the software recognizes that you have phone connected.But it works for what I bought it for, and after 6 months pays for itself."

I can't upgrade to Lion and bring Quicken 2006 along. So I am stuck with Leopard (not a bad deal for now) and Quicken 2006.

48155,1,"After having the usual glitches with Vista and Creative Suite CS2 continue with no fix in sight I decided to upgrade to CS3 and it cleared up nearly all the small problems that were encountered with the CS2 version. Creative Suite CS3 is used here at the USFS Mt Adams Ranger Station to make guides and maps for our forest visitors as well as plans for new construction and is used between 3 and 8 hours a day, seven days a week. No further problems noted though a new H/P 4750 printer was required to print InDesign and Illustrator pages exactly as they were laid out and appeared on the screen. If a designer is struggling with Vista and the CS2 version of Creative Suite upgrading to the CS3 version will bring some relief though keep in mind that the latest printers might be needed to show CS3's full potential."

It takes a little bit to get to know the in's &amp; outs of the program but it's well worth the time. I have not purchased a store-bought card in I don't know how long. I especially like being able to start with one of their cards &amp; make it my own (especially when I can change just about anything I want to (like the verse, artwork, or the size of the card).

66165,1,"After going insane with the new version of Norton Systemworks 2005, which doesn't even install, I decided to finally swear off all Symantec products.I have used Zone Alarm Pro for some time. It's not perfect, but it certainly will protect your computer. I took the plunge and went with the full security suite this week, and I've been relatively happy.On the plus side, the software works really well. The personal firewall is better than any you can find, and the virus protection found a phishing app that Norton had not (before I had unstalled it).On the minus side, the firewall can be problematic. I've had page load issues on Ebay and on my own site which has a cgi script to keep my images and files from being hotlinked (bandwidth theft). When I visit my site or any other that has a similar anti-theft cgi script, the images simply won't come up. Ebay gets all messed up as well. I haven't been able to figure out a setting that works, so I have to turn off the firewall on Ebay and a few other sites, which kind of defeats the purpose of a firewall. This doesn't happen a lot though, so it's not annoying enough to get my dander up.All in all it's been a far better investment than Symantec products, so despite its limitations I would recommend this program. It does have a lot of options to set, but they are pretty easy to get through if you are computer literate.If you decide to go with this program and you currently have Norton Antivirus, you will need to uninstall Norton before this program will run.If you were to ask me if I preferred Symantec Systemworks or Zone Alarm Security Suite, there would be absolutely no hesitation in recommending Zone Alarm."

The company does a much better than average job with customer service. My only complaint is the cost. You can buy a second hard drive for the price of this software and set up a dual boot configuration, which would suit me just fine, given the performance hit running an OS within an OS. Overall the perforamnce hit is not bad. I use this on my laptop where I can work in Linux and yet access office and other windows apps simultaneously. This does take up a lot of disk space and you will want a fairly beefy machine to get reasonable good performance out of your virtual machines."

Due to medical bills we could not afford an attorney nor did we want to go through the complex process of having a lawyer prepare our wills. We looked at the services available on-line but were uneasy about using any of them. I went to the Amazon site to see what was available and found the Quicken Willmaker Plus 2006 Estate Planning Software. Quicken is a name we had both trusted for years so we decided to try it. I ordered the software on a Friday and we had it the next Tuesday. By that Friday we each had wills, living wills, power-of-attorney and final wishes completed, signed and notarized. My husband and I recommend this product to everyone who does not have a complex estate to plan for. The software is very comprehensive and easy to use.

I just find the other areas more useful to me."
88848,1,"I've been showing these eps to my friends who were V fans back in the day and we've been having a wonderful time watching them and introducing the show to those who missed it. We agree that another V DVD set with remastered episodes,the two movies, and extras would be cool. This series is very entertaining but WB just stuck these V episodes on discs and stuck them in a box. The sound and picture could have been much much better. I'm not complaining though. I'm just happy they put this series out at all. I don't blame WB for the way they put these episodes out on DVD with no remastering or extras. V the series didn't do very well on NBC back in the 80's and that's probably why WB didn't spend much time or money on the DVDs. There were only 19 episodes of the series and it didn't get much play in syndication or anything other than the Sci Fi channel. Sci Fi stopped showing it and V The Series largely vanished into obscurity. I was surprised that video tapes of the show were put out by Columbia House a few years ago. Now the show is on DVD and it's far cheaper than the cost of the Columbia videos. Amazon has it for $29.99. Keep in mind that this is just the series and not the two v miniseries. I'd love to see a DVD set with better sounding and looking episodes and with every V that was shown on TV in one box."

77757,1,"I'm one of those people who tends to upgrade their more expensive software every other version rather than every one. That being said I've used both DreamWeaver 2 and 4, but never MX (5).I didn't notice a lot of improvement in version 4 over 2, so I wasn't that anxious to do the upgrade. But I have to say that I love MX 2004! I won't go into an extensive list of things that I can do in this one that I couldn't before, but suffice it to say, there are a lot of them.The biggest improvements to me are the more integrated workplace and the ditching of the floating pallets. I hated the floating pallets! I used the drop-down menus instead because they bugged me so much! I also love the improved FTP/Site Management interface. Secure FTP, people!The tool is slick and powerful. Well worth the cost to upgrades. The bad thing: It doesn't like my Amazon Associates code! It tags them as invalid HTML and ignores them when it uploads the site. As a result, I still have to edit those pages in FrontPage and upload the site using a traditional FTP client. Not good (this is why it only gets 4 stars).Also, in the next version Macormedia should add an ""as you go"" spell checker or at least put a button for spell check on one of the button bars. This is another thing I use FrontPage for. I edit my more text intensive pages in FP and then import them into Dreamweaver.Don't waste your money on the full suite, though. With the exception of DreamWeaver, none of them are worth the money. I'm glad I qualified for the Academic version (and discount).The tools are overrated and over priced. If you're a web designer there are free or inexpensive tools that do what you need from Freehand and Fireworx. (I am no fan of Microsoft, but after trying several tools, I do most of my web photo editing in Picture It!) The one feature I use from Fireworx is the button creator. The rest of it's extranious. Flash may look nice, but it slows your site down too much for my taste. I almost always skip the Flash animation when I visit a website.Bottom line -- Buy DreamWeaver, but skip the suite.This is a review of the PC version."

I use the program in my laptop and when hooked up to my GPS, I have what amounts to a super detailed car navigation system with a 17"" screen. As new maps become available, you can download them free into your computer as needed and it's a very easy procedure. Also, free upgrades are available on-line and that's an easy procedure too.To make the state series most useable, you need to add Back Roads Explorer, which gives much more detailed up-to-date street and street name information.The only caveates with this program is that you need a relatively fast computer and lots of memory so you can copy the whole program to your hard drive so you don't have to constantly change cd's. Also, expect to take some time to fully get to know this program."

57163,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

There were things in high school history class that I learned from this game alone.

80601,1,"I've used Microsoft products for over a decade, and just recently switched to the mac. I couldn't be happier. iWork too has been a pleasant surprise. It took me literally hundreds of hours of frustration to learn the ins-and-outs of Microsoft Office, and I even took a couple classes in college that dealt with Office. Within two days of using iWork, I was creating the best looking documents I've ever made. iWork is intuitive and fun to use. AND THE ONLINE VIDEO TUTORIALS ARE AMAZING. Be sure to watch them. I love Apple, and am just angry that I didn't make the switch years ago."
37515,1,Viruscan 6 is a huge improvement over the previous version that I had of Mcafee's software; and I needed a firewall anyways - so it was very worth the money. I bought it instead of Norton also because I'm running Win XP and Win ME on 2 different machines and Norton crashed under XP.
46606,1,"This is a 'must have' software if you hike, bike and recreate outdoors. The software interface takes a bit of getting use to, but once mastered it provides simple navigation and a lot of information. I do a lot of mountain biking in Northern California and this software lets you 'preview' a trail by mapping it (you draw a line on the trail) and the software then calculates distance travelled and the cumulative vertical ascent. This is very helpful in determining how long a ride will take, and how much physical exertion will be required. It also helps you to track your condition level - as you get in better shape you will be able to do more vertical in less time ...Once you have created a route you can send it (via e-mail) to friends, or post it on the Topo website to share with others. Other neat features are a 3 dimensional viewing package (sold separately fo $20) and the ablity to send waypoints to handheld GPS units.There really aren't any 'cons' to the software. Some things you should be aware of though are that Garmin (maker of many handheld GPS units) promotes its own topographical software. This is a pain because Garmin only allows you to send waypoints form the 'Topo' software and you can't upload the detailed maps into the handheld GPS unit. I own an Extrex Vista and the inability to load maps without buying the Garmin software is an irratant. The only other comment is that some of the maps in the software are dated so they don't always show the latest information in terms of roads and buildings. This you just get used to. Similar to other posts - When hiking or biking in remote areas don't rely on a handheld GPS exclusively, bring a printed map, and have some familiarity with a compass and know generally the area into which you are going - also let other people know where you are going (send an e-mail of your route ...). This is common sense that will save a lot of headache.Overall this software is 'a good thing' and I highly recommend it to people who enjoy spending time outside, and it is particularly good for the mountain biking community."
22407,2,"I bought this product based on the reviews from this site. While I see how this software certainly could be great (very powerful and easy to use) it failed me in two key areas:1.) For whatever reason, the AVI files from my Cannon Powershot S400 digital camera are not compatible with the Video Deluxe 2 Software. The Magix support staff, of course, blamed Cannon and provided no help whatsoever, even though the Cannon AVI files work fine with competitor software produced by Roxio and ArcSoft. Considering the popularity of Cannon cameras, this incompatibility is a major liablity.2.) Again, for whatever reason, the Video Deluxe 2 software crashes my computer every time I attempt to burn a VCD or DVD. Again, the Roxio and ArcSoft software work fine, so the problem is only with Video Deluxe 2.Despite downloading the most recent patch, it is a shame this software is so riddled with bugs. It certainly has tremendous potential if not for the bugs."
27525,1,"I've played all the Nancy Drew games, and think this is the best one so far. Like most of the Nancy games you explore a mysterious, often creepy environment, and pickup interesting facts along the way. There are always little surprises, that might make you flinch a little, when they pop up. And don't forget if you're in a pinch to use a lifeline and phone a friend!The Graphics are very good on the Nancy games, and offer enough challenges to keep older players interested, while not overwhelming younger players at the same time.I really like the diversity offered in the Nancy Drew games, it's nice to see people of all different backgrounds represented, something usually lacking in most other games.With the book and necklace this collectors set would make a great gift for any Nancy fan, or is a nice way to introduce new players to the Nancy games.Can't wait for the next one!"
38996,1,"I was a little nervous to attempt an upgrade from Windows 98 to XP because of some of the problems I've read that individuals had doing so. When I began the upgrade, there was a option to select that would test your PC to see if it was upgradeable and it told me that mine was not. However, when I restarted my PC with the upgrade DISC already installed, the upgrade began it's process. There's an option to print out instructions during the installation, I suggest that one do this so that you can have a paper copy of what to do next. Once I picked the correct options, the upgrade proceded without a hitch. Make sure you have at least 128MB of RAM and free hardrive memory space before you begin. The XP installation was a success and now it's like I have a new PC. I love it."

It makes you thing really hard unlike those make-over games that rot your brain. It made me feel like Nancy Drew. This is the best game ever, and I encourage, everybody of all ages to play this wonderful game."
92319,0,"The program has excellent features and useability. Definitely easier to use complicated features (like inserting photo in a selected area), than Elements. But On three different computers (Dell and Medion) this program causes a re-boot when I try to save a complex edit. If I keep it to changing levels, it saves fine. But using the noise reduction (which is impressive by the way) caused a reboot when I tried to save. Same when I inserted a photo in a selection area, and then tried to save. It could be an incompatibilty with one of the other programs on the computer. But I've had this problem on three different computers - all with XP2 and all with Firefox (But I temporarily removed Firefox, and the problem persisted, so I don't it is to blame). Had the same problem with Version 9 as well. Perhaps the incompatibility is with XP2 - Don't know. It is a mystery and keeps me from giving this a 5 star rating. I called tech support - they were unable to identify a fix for the problem - so I'm returning the software.When I used version 9 (before XP2) it worked fine, and I liked the software a lot. It's browser-organizer is faster than the one in Elements and Photo Album. But it's not much good if the software has problems working properly under XP2."
27742,0,"Yes Vista Sucks we've known this since its inception. Well this version with the laptop i use runs quick but yes is still very quirky, but nothing that can't be rectified by a little patience. I have the ASUS, G50,(Republic of Gamers) laptop, with an Intel Centrino Duo 2, and 9800M Nvidia card and 4 gigs of RAM. Vista 64 runs very very fast with these specs, the main problem i seem to run into is that there is a lot, and i mean a lot of hang time installing certain programs, sometimes you really wanna just chuck it out the window, but if you wait it will be just fine. I've heard many stories of the operating system being unstable due to 3rd party software having new patches that they werent sure would work or not. Well lets just say most do, few don't. So running this on a high end machine like this is pretty much a breeze with just a few minor flaws. Do not and i repeat do NOT attempt to use Vista 64 with an AMD Turionx2 Processor, this is the bottom of the barrel AMD and quite frankly one of the most painstaking and sllloooww processes you will ever try to go through. I had an HP with a an AMD Turionx2 M-72 and wow it would barely even bring up windows without lagging or freezing, or just taking literally 10 seconds to do so. And mind you this was with 4 gigs of RAM and a low end decent ATI 3250 gcard. So if you go for this upgrade one advantage(if you really thing you need it) is that you can upgrade to 8 gigs of memory which in my min d is a bit overkill, but some may benefit from it. So yes it is better than Vista Premium 32 bit, as long as you have a high end machine with a great intel chip in it, steer clear of the AMDs for now, they have a LOT and i do mean a LOT of catching up to do with Utilizing Vista. Btw i have an early copy of Windows 7 and was not really that impressed, its just a fancy version of this with some new features(nothing special) and a little more system stability. I was hoping for something in a total new direction, so lets hope they tweak it to where is nothing like vista, but don't hold your breath. I'll stick with this one, ONLY because i have to, R.I.P XP you were the best along with 2000.:("
55902,1,"Tivola's Max games are wonderful for my two boys. They are very funny and thought provoking. My kids have SO MANY pre-school games and educational cd's that are from here in the states. These are a welcome change from the lot of games that feature boldly colored circus goofs that quite frankly, bore the heck out of my kids and end up teaching them little. I got a Tivola demo with the Little Prince and popped it in for my 2 and 5 year olds. They were interested right away. The games are not dificult,and my children have no trouble with the accents. Tivola gets my applause for subtlety, and the non-commercial format. They make gentle games, which to my amazement, suit my two (very) rowdy boys."
12419,1,"I work for a big name computer company (one of Microsoft's rivals actually) and I am not a fan of Microsoft products. I have to give them credit on this one though. This is truly a great system. It boots incredibly fast and the home network support is a dream. It does however require a powerful PC to run, and it has some security holes. These holes are being fixed as fast as people can exploit them though, and believe me I'm one of the ones looking. This is the operating system to choose for home and small business use that have the newer hardware, large corporations have other concerns based on their needs so it may or may not be for them. A word of advice to ""home users"" on the choice of XP or Linux. Linux is not the way to go if you just want to do your check book, email, surfing the net, or video games. If you can write you own software, drives, or know what the ""core"" is; Linux is the way to go. Personally I love Linux and use it every day, but there is no way I'm suggesting my wife install it on her PC. Just my 2 cp."
87784,1,"For those of you who aren't familiar with F-13, it is a complition of games, screen savers, scary sounds, backdrops, and a short story. My favorite backdrop is the cemetery. I tried using the screensavers (It's just lightning was my favorite.) and had memory problems on both my Performa and my iMac. Any suggestions out there? There are oodles of scary sounds, some of which grossed me out. The games are good too. Whack-a-Zombie is challenging and very addictive. I liked the variety of the ghouls in this game. Bug Splat is somewhat addicting and very gory. No Swimming was fun for five minutes, but then got a little boring after the fifth cow got eaten. More variety could've been used with that game.Everything's Eventual was very good. I won't spoil the plot for you. You will just have to go out and buy it for yourself."

This upgrade is no different than 2003 and the user interface ""Bites"". The only reason I upgraded was because they threatened to stop honoring my electronic transactions unless I upgraded. What kind of BS is that. If MS Money wasn't so difficult to use I switch in a heart beat. This is my last upgrade, after this I'm using my banks web site for all my banking needs. The quicken product has really gone down hill and all they want is to get is many dollars out of you as they can."

57433,1,"Pc-Cillin, over the years, has been one of the popular and trusted packages alongside Norton, but unlike Norton that takes up system resources like crazy, PC-Cillin is friendly with resources, loads quickly once logged into your system, and has easy-to-use tools. I never seemed to have problems getting updates live, I remember Norton would get mad at you if your connection got interrupted and live update had to stop and it became corrupt and you have a live agent telling you may need to reinstall Norton since what they tell you to do doesn't work. I've had my connection get interrupted a couple times during a live update with PC-Cillin, but it was always able to reestablish the connection again and properly get the correct updates for your program and definitions. Allows you to switch between profiles with connections, so if you have a wireless connection, you can switch Pc-Cillin to look at that profile if you are using a wireless connection and switch back to direct if you are wired (or on dial-up). The firewall settings are very simply put and don't have you go through many tabs, which can get confusing (I am comparing a lot of these settings to Norton's. I'm not trying to speak down to Norton since I have used it and it's great, but Norton is a very sketchy program and is quite unstable in my own opinion. I've used Internet Security 2006 and I've had so much problems with it). The feature I really liked the most was the feature where you could look at who was connected to your network, whether it be wireless or wired. It was a simple way to review who is online and if an address you see is not correct or right to you -you can mark it as NOT TRUSTED or DO NOT TRUST and it deny's access to that particular MAC address. You can also password protect your settings too, which is just one more step to better security. Lastly, it does deep scans for viruses, spyware, & malware/grayware and does a good job of it. If Pc-Cillin can't take are of a certain virus or issue, it will usually tell you the loaction and how to manually delete if necessary for the end user to accomplish. Other great features include the vulnerability check, which scans your system for open vulnerabilities (most of these may occur, if one or two pop up, when you haven't done a windows update in a while). The anti-graud wizard and setup is nice too as you can enter in sensative information, whether it be the last digits of your phone number or passwords, PC-Cillin will monitor that once entered in properly. Overall, tons of great features and once again, NOT a resource hog and runs perfectly with your Windows Operating System. Great program Trend Micro. *Thumbs up*"
58516,2,"Garmin's map products seem to have three problems:1. They're overpriced.2. Their installation program consistently fails, at least on my PC.3. ""Technical support"" is available only M-F, 8-5, and they take several days to respond to email queries.It would be nice if 3rd party mapping products, such as Delorme's Topo USA, worked on Garmin's GPS units.

54471,1,"These are probably the best four Scooby Doo games made for the PC.They are fun for an older child/adult just looking to pass some time; they are fun and mind challenging for the younger crowd. The games themselves are relatively short and are the basic point/click and wait for the cut screen to play out. There are also puzzles to solve; albeit not very difficult once you've mastered them or if this game is being played by someone older than the target audience.The colors and graphics are very bright, vivid and remarkably well done for the age of the games, however, don't expect anything as modern as some of today's video games, even those for the PC. These are very line and sketch; cartoony, almost as if you are playing through a Scooby Doo episode.The prices for this set now is a little ridiculous; I remember when I was about eleven buying this same four pack in T.J. Maxx for about $8 or $10 dollars--- however, we are talking about over ten years ago, but still...how times have changed."
72122,1,"There have been quite a few ""first-person strategy"" games over the last three years or so. The whole genre started with Battlezone and Uprising, and continued in 2000 with Dark Reign 2 and Ground Control. And now, we have Hostile Waters: Antaeus Rising.If you've played any of the previously mentioned games, you'll feel right at home with this one. So what exactly sets this one apart from the rest of the pack? The biggest difference is the moderately well-written storyline. Obviously, Warren Ellis put some thought into it, because instead of setting his storyline in an apocalyptic post-nuclear world, he sets his story in a post-21st century utopia. Which is a pleasant surprise...and much needed considering recent tragic events.The interface is also very well thought out, but does require a bit of time to master. The result however, is probably the best (and easy to use) interface for a first-person-strategy game to date. A few quick keystrokes, and you can command other pilots to act as your wingmen, or command them to attack a target of your choice.Most of the missions are of the bog-standard ""kill everything that moves"" variety. That's fine by me, as I never excel very well at defence or espionage missions.You get some pretty neat units and weapons in the latter half of the game. Some examples include the Rhino and Behemoth tanks, which can be outfitted with devastating artillery cannons. An EMP cannon, which can be used to quickly disable enemy turrets. And a super-flamethrower, which can be used to, quite literally, burn down buildings.The hardware requirements for this game are quite steep. I played this game on my old Pentium III 550MHz and had to use low details on the final missions. However, I've also played this game on my new Athlon 2000+ XP, and I can play it on the highest detail levels without even slowing down. So anyone with a PC faster than 1GHz won't have a problem running this game.I've owned this game for almost two years now, and I'm delighted to say that I'm still having fun playing it. It's unfortunate that Hostile Waters wasn't more popular when it was first released, because this game from Rage Software is a definite classic."
66283,0,"I was really looking forward to this, and I'm mostly happy, but a little let down. Sure, it's got every issue, but the quality was not what I expected. Unlike the beautiful, cleaned up, color-corrected pages of the Masterworks collections, this disc is basically hand-scanned pages from actual comic books. There are yellowing pages, damaged pages, countless crooked pages, glare on recent issues and often the black levels could be better. Most annoying is that solid colors on older issues have that newsprint pattern you get whenever you try to scan a newspaper, so it's not even a good representation of what the original books look like in hand. I guess this is the price of getting all the old ads and letters pages, but it would've been nice to know that's what was contained."

However, once you get familiar with FP, you inevitably find that it does not do everything you think it would, or should. Enter the ActionPack by Office Power!. Its a great little suite of programs that either adds new functionality to FrontPage alltogether or improves existing functionality.For example - PollWizard allows a user to add customized polls to their pages with little effort. SiteTagger takes the tedious process of preparing pages for search engines inherent in FrontPage and automates it for you. If you have a lot of static pages to tag up for a site you are going to deploy, this is a real time saver. Quickworks is another versatile tool with a lot of great built in features that save on development time and allows you to save your own bits of often used code.The programs are speedy, install with no problems and the included online help files have always answered any questions I have had. Bottom line is if you have FrontPage you should have the ActionPack. As a FrontPage Microsoft Certified Professional and freelance developer, its made my life easier."

42276,1,"We've been using Office XP for way too long, but it did everything we needed it to do so there was no reason to upgrade.When my wife got a new laptop, some of the software she uses under Windows 7 wouldn't work with Office XP, and we were forced to bite the bullet and upgrade to the current version. And it honestly isn't bad! Very different coming from something so old, but there are a lot of improvements that make it worthwhile.I'm not crazy about how Microsoft changed around it's various licensing schemes and the cost of upgrading, but the Home and Student version hits the sweet spot of giving us what we needed without too extreme a cost.If you only need the basic applications in Office, and it's time to upgrade, this package is definitely worth a look."
3491,1,"This set of discs does what few other methods can - teach you how to speak Palestinian Arabic. There are no printed materials, you can make your own from your notes. Other methods will teach you Al FusHa, classical Arabic (which no one speaks) or MSA (modern standard arabic) which will help you to understand most dialects, sort of.Since 1948, most Arabic-speaking people understand the Palestinian dialect. So you can either learn Egyptian Arabic, or learn Palestinian. This set of 8 discs is reasonably priced, and I can't recommend it highly enough."

83386,1,"Since May 19th 2005, OpenBSD version 3.7 has been availablefor purchase/download. While 3.6 is good (I'm still running itwhile I wait for my 3.7 cdrom to arrive) 3.7 is even better.3.6 Install is a breeze and takes about 10 minutes. Installingall the application packages I use (KDE,xpdf,LaTeX,gvim,etc)takes about another hour via dsl download. There are problemswith USB 2.0 support in 3.6, but USB support improves in 3.7.Prior experience with unix is helpful, but not necessary -the man pages are very well written and complete. Switch toOpenBSD and internet malware(trojans, viruses, popups, etc)will cease to be a problem."

50085,1,"I upgraded my Intel-based Macbook from 10.4. The upgrade took about 75 minutes. Besides all the slick new features that are being focused on, I am most happy with the changes to the networking. Now I can more easily browse and attach to shares on my mixed Windows/Mac home network. The only negative I've encountered is that sleep mode doesn't usually work, whereas in 10.4 it was flawless. When I open the screen, half the time I never get the screen back, just the mouse cursor, causing me to force the machine off. Juniper VPN software also doesn't work on this release, but this is really Juniper's issue on catching up with this version."
46029,1,"I purchased StarOffice as an alternative to MS Office 2000, and have not yet been really disappointed, although I have been less than impressed by some issues.To begin with, the price difference between MS Office and StarOffice alone should justify the purchase of StarOffice. At roughtly ($$), StarOffice blows the doors off MS Office XP, currently listed at ($$$)Secondly, StarOffice currently runs on Linux, Solaris, and Windows, while MS Office only runs on the Windows platform.StarOffice can save in file formats for both native StarOffice, as well as the usual MS Office formats. The biggest disappointment is that MS Office does not support the StarOffice formats. So, if you wish to have cross-application files, you'll need to save in the MS Office format.The other part about StarOffice that I am not really happy with is the sometimes slow response to open or perform some tasks. This is due in part to the JVM being installed which I can only assume handles many of the internal StarOffice utilities. Since MS doesn't really recognize Sun's JVM, you'll wind up with 2 different installations of Java on your machine.I have spent some of my time since purchasing StarOffice in migrating my systems away from Microsoft products. To date, I have been happy, and have only run into an occasional problem. My Solaris, Linux and Windows systems all seem happy with StarOffice."

56584,1,"My 3 1/2 yr old son graduated from rr baby & toddler to this a few months ago and it's been great. He needed help at first but caught on really quickly. I just wish they would provide a parents' manual with it because sometimes he gets frustrated because he hasn't got enough crystals to do something and I can't help as I haven't actually played the game through myself. But he now knows how to use the mouse to point, click and drag without really having been shown and without having spent hours playing - he spends maybe an hour a week on the computer."
47448,1,"I thought this product was very helpful in teaching my whole family some basic german before our vacation to Switzerland. The graphics were fun and the video simulations were a great way to practice what we were learning. It really focuses on the practical application of the language, giving simulations for cabs, restaurants, shopping, etc. My kids loved hearing themselves on the playback and it even encouraged my teen daughter to take a foreign language class is school. I recommend this product highly."

32850,1,"I'm a long-time Mac/Apple systems user (Apple IIe in 1983, Macs since the late 80s). Being in the visual effects business, I finally succumbed this year and bought my first PC, a nice Toshiba Qosmio laptop, so that I could use various Windows-only software packages, including 3-D apps. I have two Macs at home and various external HDD and files I wanted to be able to move data/media seamlessly between both platforms (furthermore, I'm looking to get a new MacPro tower when they come out, and run BootCamp to make that system dual-OS, and will need such functionality then).So, MacDrive 6 was purchased and installed on day 1. I was instantly pleased--mac CDs and HDDs were swappable between my systems without a hitch. I was even able to mount my old 10GB firewire iPod and use it w/ iTunes on my Windows machine. All was well until...A few weeks later I purchased Roxio's Easy Media Creator Suite 8. I'm a longtime user of the Toast/Popcorn products they make for the Mac platform and figured I'd stick with them (instead of other apps like Nero). That's when weird things started happening. It came to a head last week when I purchased a nice new Maxtor OneTouch III 1TB triple-interface external drive. The goal was to have a huge central store for media and backups for all my systems. Setup was to be a breeze, according to the documentation and all reviews/reports I'd read. Wrong. It comes pre-formatted for Mac, and between that and tests w/other drives, the net result was the same--initial drive recognition, followed by a sudden system crash, the dreaded stop error/blue screen. A reboot loop would ensue until the volume was unplugged/removed.After several days of testing/problem-solving, I stumbled across a support doc on the MediaFour (maker of MacDrive 6) website, acknowledging a severe conflict between MacDrive 6 and Easy Media Creator 8. They apparently both have drivers dealing w/ mac volumes that will bring about the above crippling results until one or the other software package is un-installed. I've contacted both companies to see if an update/workaround to fix this is available or will be soon. Until then, I have Roxio's software uninstalled--a $70 coaster until this is resolved.If MediaFour solves this problem--I'd boost my rating to 5 stars."
41422,1,"Sound Studio 3 is a great item for editing sound tracks.It works as expected, and I highly recommend it.I especially like the fact that it works with Stitch (an accessory plug-in which is FREE) to combine many sound tracks into one track.Highly recommended!"
31572,0,"Norton tends to be the best for catching everything, but it is horribly slow, I just dont think that the risk outweighs the spped problems. Their are plenty of other solutions out there that let your computer run smoothly and give you excellent protection, if you are running a business, then maybe its worth it."
88236,1,"If Linux is what you want then go with the oldest distribution around. Slackware has been with us for 10 years and keeps getting better with every release. These are not 4 or 5 times a year like the other distros!Although install is still text it is very easy to follow and getting a system up and running is a matter of minutes. Most everything (if not all) is recognized by the setup program so on startup all is well.On first login you won't have a graphical login. But that is easy to remedy. Just put a line into the /etc/rc.d/rc.local file that goes like this:/opt/kde/bin/kdm (if you chose KDM as your window manager)or use/usr/bin/gdm (if you chose GNOME as your window manager)or /usr/bin/X11/xdm if you did not install KDE or GNOME.and if you don't want to do any of the above, log in and typestartxand the GUI will start up.I've used this distro for close to 10 years along with FreeBSD. It is not bloated, it is fast, and there is lot of help on forums and search engines if you run into trouble. Highly recomend it. And if you like it, support Slackware, get a subscription."
94657,1,"I have the Elementary Advantage, and I'm about to go into Middle School Advantage. I find these programs are excellent. I am a homeschooling parent, and the Elementary Advantage suite have done a great job in assisting me with teaching my child. I've learned a lot myself. My son is about to enter middle school grades, and as I explore the the Middle School Advantage suite, I marvel at how well its put together. I have not run into answers that are wrong as was the claim of one reviewer. But, that does not bother me because you will find wrong answers in educational books written by the best educators. I focus on the how well I am taught the subject. If I can catch the wrong answers then I was taught well. I paid only $24.99 for each suite. I also have a Dell Dimension 4600, and the programs run fine. For all those having a problem running the program. You better get a Dell, Dude! For the money, IT'S GREAT!"
87096,1,I bought the OEM version for my Mac Mini. I installed it under Boot Camp 1.2 and it works fine. Aero looks great and it runs very good. No issues yet. I use the OS for compatibility and I'm still a Flight Simulator fan so I use it for that. However I still use OS X for my mission critical programs. For an Intel Mac - I highly recommend.
16414,1,"Frontpage 2000 is a great program that allows beginners to advanced web designers to have awesome websites. The program's features are very flexible and allow you to edit in both WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) mode and Raw HTML mode. It will make frames for you automatically, a feature that many webmasters want but are not sure how to create, and much more. This is a wonderful, powerful program that I definitely recommend buying if you have the money."
18992,1,"My five year old got this for christmas and she absolutely loves it. It's colorful and playful format keeps her engaged for quite a while. Even now, two months later, she still loves this program. She loves to draw and this program gives her another medium to create while teaching her various art related concepts. A great purchase for the little artist in your family."
3637,0,"I've just started using the program and I think it's ok for burning CDs/DVD's and backing up files. Also easy straight forward for converting analog music (tapes, records) to CD. The labeling component however is a mess! Very awakward, slow to respond and the different backrounds do not appear on the label once you select them. At least not on my computer which has far beyond the needed specs."
30000,0,"I loaded this on 2 computers with no problems (other that slowing the system down a little it worked fine) but loading the last computer had errors that I had to work on for 2 days with Norton tech svcs. The program still doesn't work perfect yet. It won't update or run complete system scan. I feel it does protect the computer, for now. My wife wants to go back to 2006 ver it works better without error and system runs faser. I hate to have to purchase 2 ver to take care of 3 computers."
73553,1,"Rosetta Stone has an engaging format and my children learned far more using it than with any of the previously tried language programs. We purchased the German set first and then the Spanish. However, the company's policies on replacements warrant note. We somehow lost one of the Spanish Language CD's and I contacted the company about getting a replacement. Most companies replace discs for a small fee or free, so I thought this a small matter. I went through a maze of people, some of whom bordered on rudeness, getting different answers. In the end, I was told that they would not replace the disc but would replace the whole set for half price since I could prove I purchased the program. If I bought it directly from the company, they would replace it for $75 (first time I'd heard about a punishment for not buying direct). For homeschoolers, the replacement fee was $50. Ouch. Well, I bit the bullet and paid, then hastened to make back-up copies. After all, when children use discs, they tend to get scratched or lost. I was unable to do so; apparently the disc is protected from copying. Therefore, I take the risk of having to pay big bucks just to keep using a program I already paid a small fortune for initially. I'm simply not rich enough for that, and I imagine there are a few other people who aren't too, so I wanted to warn you before you purchased."
21323,1,"Great software! Travel through the Revolution side by side with reporters James and Sarah. Once you think you have gathered enough quotes, come back to the print shop and print your story. Then, depending on how good your story is, you get a certain number of subscriptions. (ex.:600, 550, 500, etc.) But beware! Some parts are harder than others.Sometimes, to be able to interview people, you have to run around town trying to find stuff for them. (ex.: a bayonet, a jackknife, a loaf of bread, a quill pen, a map, a telescope, etc.)This is a great game, very fun. Now I know more about the Revolution than practically everyone in my class. The only downside is that when you have played the ENTIRE SEVEN LEVELS OF THE GAME five times, it gets a little boring. If a friend has it, ask to borrow it. If you find yourself playing over and over and telling your friend ""No, I don't have it, I'm still playin'"" or ""Be patient, would ya?"" , then it's time to put it in your ... shopping cart and GET IT, QUICK!!!"

28704,0,"The biggest problem that I have with HoTMetaL Pro is that the product is not really suited for use on a site that already exists! HoTMetaL Pro comes with a built in HTML validator which is uses to check that what you are writing makes sense as HTML.This is normally a great idea because it will pick up on typos and other mistakes which can be quite tricky to track down when you make a mistake on your page. However, if you load existing code into the program, HoTMetaL Pro will want to carry out the same validation operation on that page.Now, that might occasionally be useful. Suppose that there is a fault on the page which you didn't spot because the browser that you use to view the site didn't object to the code. (Most browsers make their best guess as to the page author's intent if they spot an error in the HTML syntax.)However, it is much more likely that something that is odd on an existing page is actually intended to be that way for good reason. For example, webrings, advertising banner servers and statistics trackers require that you insert their code, without changes into your html. They use robots to scan your site and check that you are compliant.The HoTMetaL Pro validator will almost certainly want to change that code which will render it invisible to those robots who will then assume that your site is broken.Because of this, I simply could not even consider using the product on my site. The software does have the ability to turn off validation and so it will leave your existing code unmolested. Unfortunately, if you select this option, the product can only be used in HTML source view. No wysiwyg view is available. In that case, there is little advantage of using this product over a programmer's text editor (such as emacs) which is set up for HTML.So, for those reasons, I do not use this product apart from the very rare occasions when I want to work on a new page with no stats or webring functions. While it is not bad to use, I must say that if you already have a site, or if you think that, one day your site may expand to use things that will upset HoTMetaL Pro, you should avoid this product."
88512,1,"This program is fantastic! I bought just because it was cheap and my 9 year old need some help, but I was very surprised. Not only did her reading comprehension improve but she also has an added confidence in interest in reading.The program also has a monotoring section where I would see how long my child worked on the exercises and how she did.Overall I was very satisfied wigh my purchase and have even bought the math from the same company - I definetly recommend it!"
29633,1,Runs on older Windows versions. Very good. My son loves it. Beware: WILL NOT RUN ON WIN VISTA 64 Bit -- get an incompatible os error message -- Believe this is a 16 bit program which VISTA does not support at all (only 32 and 64 bit).
63082,1,"Overall, I'm very pleased with OS X Tiger, it's much easier to use than Windows. I am a recent PC to Mac switcher, it's only been about 2 weeks. I was able to switch with the help of a site that I found on the web. I don't think I can put the link in this post but go to either Google or Yahoo and do a search for ""switchtoamac"". You can then check out the site.Overall, I've had very positive experiences with my new Mac and based on my initial reaction, I won't be going back to a PC. I've been using my new Mac and OS X Tiger to organize my extensive photo collection, I love iPhoto 5. What an amazing and easy to use program. I even signed up for Apple's .Mac service to allow me to easily share my photos with my friends and family. The Spotlight feature has made it easy to find photos, what a time saver!!"

52992,0,"I am somewhat of a pro when it comes to digital video productions and have used several different software applications. I thought this one looked interesting due to the music files and included clips.I wish I would have tried a trial version first, because I wouldn't have wasted my money.First of all when you build a story line or save a project the imported files (if coming from the included CD's)do not stay with the project. You need to reload them each time. They don't load to the media pool upon import, so if you remove them from the story line, you have to load them over and over again. At least this is the trouble I have been having. The transition time is hard to adjust, and there is no option that I found to repeat the same transition, they have to be added one at a time. When transitions are added a screen pops each time up with some settings that are difficult to understand. All of the adjustments are tricky--and certainly would be even more difficult for the novice user. I have an older version of MGI video wave, which I would rate better than this program. However the one I like the best and seems to have a great interface is Arc-Soft, Show Biz- For the money, I would say that program is a much better value and a lot more fun than Video Explosion. I am giving this 3 stars because it is simple to clip the videos on the storyboard timeline, and you can accomplish a good production with work. I don't see an option to save the final recording in a DVD format however."

I was using PageMaker, but at the time, Quark was pre-press capable & PageMaker was NOT. Once you know it...it is great.

Worse, it could notcorrect the bad partition boundary or recover my lostdisk space.I communicated with PowerQuest's tech support staff forsix months before they claimed to have a fix.

Forget the warranty; it expiredwhile tech support was researching/ignoring the problem!I reported this chicanery to the BBB.

28867,1,"I have used Peachtree Accounting for about 5 years now. I am happy with it's capabilities, but it is not particularly user friendly. The interface is not at all intuitive and there is a lot of redundancy. It is a very mouse intense program (five mouse clicks to complete a task when two would have sufficed). The account reconciliation program for balancing your checkbook is cumbersome and difficult to use.I have an MBA and a strong accounting background and it definitely helps in using this program. I think this is more of a useful tool for accountants or professional bookkeepers than your average entrepreneurial Joe running his own small business. For that type of user, I would probably recommend QuickBooks.Peachtree is far superior for keeping track of inventory and its payroll features are excellent. It also has a job costing feature that I use that I don't think can be matched by any other software in its price range.Overall, if you are an intermediate to expert computer user and have a strong knowledge of accounting, or do a lot of job costing or work with inventories, this is an excellent tool. But it is clearly not for everyone. If you don't need some of these features, or if you want the program to demystify accounting and make it easy, you might want to look for a product that is easier to use or more appropriate to your accounting needs."

I received my tax refund via direct deposit TWO WEEKS LATER...that's right, both federal and state refunds arrived in my account two weeks after I filed.

The Jumpstart team is so loaded with technical talent and teaching savvy, but apparently they don't think that social skills matter, since the whole product is centered around a loud and sassy girl who is bad company for any child. The marketing team at Jumpstart apparently believes that their product won't sell if animated characters are courteous and supportive. I never buy their products anymore because I don't want to have to spend time reminding my son never to imitate the appalling behavior portrayed on Jumpstart."

26240,1,"Running Windows 95 and that means Windows 98 is illegal in your country and you are in the land of needing a new computer fast, feeling that you might have a box that looks like it is running windows 3.1 and to be honest now is your chance to move to Windows 2000 for a more solid operating system. Even NT users found more stability in Windows 2000, 98 users mostly gamers or downloaders, seeing the blue screen of death often, while Win 2K users doing something a little more software intensive like multimedia, graphics and servers that 98 could not manage. So came the day of the duel-processor, having an NT Dual 500mhz, upgrading to Win2K and you still had a fast machine, 64mb and 128mb games cards never really impressing you that much to get a better machine, a games console maybe cheaper and better, XP a little slow for you and besides, 2K was compatible with nearly everything and you could duel boot linux for fun. The only reason to buy a computer between the release of XP and now was if you did not have one and even then plenty of second hand units going around.Year: 2005256mb graphics cards, LCD monitors on the cheap, DVD-R media, Broadband, now is the time to upgrade your machine. AMD have some nice chips but the hyperthreading Intel P4 3.0GHz is a killer chip. 1GB of RAM, no problem. A pimpin' fast graphics card and you have a machine that can play Half-Life 2 on full resolution. The best games of the 21st century were released before Christmas this year, with 2005 bringing lots more to come. Broadband on the increase, DVD-R media and life might get less expensive if you are into computers and certainly a whole pile better.Why not Linux? Well XP2 has the games and Linux not, so we can stop there. For speed on an OS, well Linux is a much faster, but XP2 is not bad on a system with half the ram of the above and a 1 GHz processor. If you are programming or doing fundamental computer work then do check out Linux because it might be what you need and learning Linux is like DOS with a bit of windows with all the free fundamental software you could want. Why not Apple? Well the same as above, but you have a better selection of stuff and to be honest multimedia applications work well on an apple, and why shouldn't they since Apple is industry standard for that kind of design work, so what does XP2 have to offer?Obviously stability (not to be confused with security). XP2 is a very stable operating system. It is more stable than Windows 2000. For that reason, I made the upgrade. I have not found XP2 doing much annoying or something that I could not fix with Google. Installing is a big deal because you need Internet for verification; however it is fast on a high end system. There are obvious things you must do after you install it like download Firefox and use it instead of IE and try to use realplayer instead of mediaplayer, use Microsoft's AntiSpyware, don't use the firewall, use zonelarm free instead, spend on a good anti-virus software package, turn off the preview pane in Internet Outlook mail or try to find a free mail browser, make sure you get all the latest windows updates, careful what you put into your machine or extract, careful what mail you open, change passwords every week, and you can achieve a secure on-line machine that can do anything most computers can do right now with a company that has admitted that it has a security problem that will be addressed with future updates, but overall one should be impressed with the OS for stability, not speed or security, but for not crashing, as long as there are no hardware configuration conflicts, that do happen, get someone else to build your machine and blame them when it doesn't come together (and it wont come together because things are now cutting edge so get it done elsewhere; if your task bar hangs this is because of routers or USB hubs that are not compatible). The machine like the above is a 5 star experience but God help those who don't address security issues the moment they go on-line with it which is a bit like just driving your car off a cliff. Expect to loose everything to a virus and have your address details stolen with all your VISA card info.XP2 PRO is 5 stars if you visit a place on the web called Gibson research incorporated, a highly respected individual in the security community who developed a way that people can test the vulnerability of their PC on-line. He developed a series of a security fixes for XP1 and XP2 problems. Bookmark that page and use it to have a somewhat secure and stable XP2.Also remember, forget the HOME EDITION, go PRO."

First it needs a lot of time yet to find out how to make a simple recording, because there are several steps to take. Maybe its a good application for DJs, I dont know because I am not into this, but as a simple recording program I would recommend Garageband - I do classic music ensemble recording with multitrack overdub and was always frustrated with the confusing interface of Ableton live. I just want to open a program and click on record, not first for each function study the manual. So I am much more happy with Garageband. If ""Live"" is freeware it would be acceptable, but for 300 Bucks I am awaiting something better!"
13735,0,"I've owned/tried just about all of the major antivirus and security suites out there: Norton, Trend Micro, McAfee, and I chose Zone Alarm this year because it had consistently scored very well in comparison tests, especially the firewall. Here are the three factors that I look for in a security suite: 1)Low footpring and memory requirements. This is one of the reasons Norton has been off my hard-drive for a couple of years. An antivirus/firewall/secuity suite should not gobble up system resources. 2)Seamless integration and smooth interface. The program should be easy to use and unobtrusive. This is a security suite, not a game I play for fun. 3)Performance. Obviously, your software should do its job and do it well. So how does Zone Alarm rank?1)Memory requirements: average. It's better than Norton, but not as good as Trend Micro's PC-Cillin. It's not a hog, but could be slimmer.2)Interface and integration: Below average. The interface is clunky and rather unintuitive, and while I appreciate the wealth of options, they can be confusing to the inexperienced. While I consider myself an above average user, the novice will be mystified by some of the options and menu questions thrown at them. The BIGGEST annoyance with this suite is that it is very, very sensitive. In a way it's a good thing (it's doing its job), but the downside is that this software requires constant micro-management. Installing a new game? You can expect Zone Alarm to halt your installation at least three times, thinking that the game might be a virus or malicious script. Trying to connect to the internet? Be prepared to again deal with Zone Alarm's internet police for every program that accesses the web. Worst of all is the ""Privacy"" guard feature in Zone Alarm. The base settings block everything- pictures in web pages don't load up (in the off-chance that they might contain some embedded malicious code), and transactions, even secure ones, routinely fail because ZoneAlarm blocks everything. Sure, you can customize the permission levels for each individual program, but then it becomes an orgy of micromanagement.3)Performance: Above average. Yes, the suite does its job. It blocks intrusions like a champ, it cleans well and effectively, but all of this comes at a price. Installing this software is like putting bars on your windows: sure, you're safe, but nothing gets in or out without permission from the warden; and that includes you."

However, if you have some really sensitive information on your computer that you want removed, this software will get it scrubbed clean - no worries. Warning: if you are a beginner user - take your computer to a shop and pay to let them do it. Also, if you use a really old and outmoded operating system (Windows 98?) you may want to try something else. I used it on an XP and a Vista computer and had no problem."
89457,1,"Our six-year-old and his four-year-old brother have spent hours with this program. They love creating their own contraptions. We often hear them laughing with glee about the funny chain of events that they have created. The program looked complicated at first, but it has a very good set of tutorial challenges which teach you about how the various components work (gears, lazers, mandrils on conveyor belts, vials of nitroglycerine, etc.). Our six-year-old is now able to solve most of these challenges without any adult help. Not every child will enjoy this program, but if you have a youngster who is intrigued by technology and how things work, give this program a try. You may be surprised about how much they can learn from it at a young age."
42393,0,"I do understand it's a great tool but as usual with Microsoft software (and many other big shots) they put too much gadgets. This makes the program non so ""user friendly"" and subject to too many ""updates"".All this become an evere ending story (even if for free it's simply annoying)."

Just make sure you're pc is set to 32-bit display so you can see the videos properly.The program is wonderful. If you have in-depth tech knowledge it may seem too easy. The instructions are in plain English so you don't have know all the tech terms. I didn't know what divx meant until I used this product. There are a lot of parts to the program. I found every part to be as easy as the disk authoring one. Since I am not technical I need a program which is easy to understand and this one fits the bill.

Maybe I'm not a Mac user by prenatal personality type, but this came with my computer, and I work in printing. No one here quite knows what it does, besides ""lets your PC see mac files."" We have an elaborate network here, and don't see any difference.

If you want nice-looking detailed printed maps for a specific area, this is not the 1:24,000 7 1/2-minute quad sheets with their fine local detail of structures and landmarks you are used to. First, the data is low-resolution compared to traditional quad sheets. Shorelines and streams are jagged lines rather than smooth curves reflecting local detail, and topo seems to be 25-foot contours whether the terrain is flat or steep and whether 5-foot contours are on the real quads or not. And you can't print quad sheets - there seems to be a hard limit at 11 x 17. I found this useful, but not what I wanted or expected. The sales literature needs to be specific about the limitations - should have a precise spec sheet that makes these limits clear."
11823,1,"In this, his first of many adventures, Putt-putt the purple convertible is trying to get ready for the Cartown pet parade by getting a car wash/paint job, a balloon, and a pet.

Besides getting a balloon and finding a pet, Putt-putt has the whole town of Cartown to explore and he can visit with the various citizens, too. Like other Humongous Entertainment games there are lots of hidden clickables for kids to find too.**System requirements: the Putt-putt series uses the SCUMM gaming engine instead of the DOS used by most games of the time, meaning that Putt-putt can be played on more advanced PC's like XP without the use of a dos-box**Putt-putt joins the parade was one of the first PC games I ever played so I feel certain nostalgia for this point-and-click adventure. It terms of character Putt-putt is a great role model for kids with his calm and polite manner, and is still fun and easy for kids to identify with.

12909,1,"This is a very pretty operating system. It also takes well with networking and user specific settings and such. Even with something simple like a Microsoft based network you'll find this OS performing very well. Ok but then what...? Do i suggest upgrading? Nope. If you already have a solid 2k network or structure then I suggest keeping it unless you just simply want XP. It doesn't quite have everything that 2k offers. Also I do not suggest upgrading for the sake of Hardware. Many types of hardware will find that they are not compatible with XP and you'll have to upgrade device drivers until you're sick. WIth a corporation handling several thousand computers that upgrade to XP and realize that XP doesn't like the NIC cards... that can get really hairy. As well there are many program issues that need to be dealt with. I had such a problem with apps not wanting to work and having to reinstall them and then download XP patches, add in the hardware issues, it seemed I was rebuilding systems from the image up. Stick with 2k unless you're upgrading from something like 98 or ME, if you'd even have ME to begin with...Some of the great upsides is the user handling. It's very similar to 2k (Documents and Settings instead of Profiles) but it gives just a little more control over the users and the way users sign on and off. Changing logins no longer requires a pseudo restart of the system.Professional also does not require registration, unlike Home edition. Once the liscenses are purchased then there is no point in registering a thousand corporate PC's that were probably all imaged to begin with. This isn't anything new over 2k but the XPHome edition would pout and hold its breath until it turned blue in the face waiting for that registration.The system also handles a lot better with program crashes and lockups. Never once have I had it freeze; neither have I seen the Blue screen of death. It uses the error sending screen in place of this. However, it is very sensitive to program's not responding and many times it won't wait for programs to get back up and start running again, it will just shut the app down. A few apps I use have a few instances where they await input from network machines... well XP thought the programs weren't responding and shut them down. I have found it a very stable system as far as it is concerned, many programs have since become unstable in their own right. If you decide to go XP, be cautious, very cautious. You may wind up sending every one of them back and having to rebuild your machines from scratch. Final note: 1 out of 8 times the XP OSunistall has worked (which returns the system to the original operating system, I don't suggest loading XP ontop of another system anyway) but every time the system restore has worked like it's always meant to work."

81682,1,"I found this product easy to install and easy to get up and running after it walked me through a 5-minute reading process so that it could &quot;learn&quot; my voice. It even came with a microphone for my computer. While I'm a fairly proficient typist, I still enjoyed watching the computer do all the work for me (like any good computer program should do).I did note that the program missed one or two words in most sentences. I will have to play with it longer to see if &quot;training&quot; it will actually improve the accuracy. While these words can be easily corrected in the pop-up box that you can verbally call up, it tends to slow down the process, making this product of questionable value for good typists. While I probably make more typing mistakes, they are more quickly corrected during manual typing than with the use of this program. Those who &quot;hunt and peck&quot; however will very likely find this program worthwhile. So far I have found that it tends to be more accurate if I give it short sentences, or if I feed it about five or six words at a time. I try to give it enough information in each sentence segment so that it can change words based on the context of the sentence. Also by giving it smaller segments I noted that they are easier to correct in the pop-up box.For the price - this program is worth the money. It's fun to use even if slower than if I had typed the document myself. My final verdict on its usefulness for proficient typists is not in yet, as I need to give it a better workout and see if it &quot;learns&quot; to be more accurate. In the mean time I'm ready to sit back and have some fun watching it do most of the work for me."
44488,1,"We used this card in our Garmin during a recent 10 day trip to Ireland. We drove over 1400 miles and it kept us from getting lost numerous times. Our only criticisms are that, as tourists, it would have been nice to have directions to more attractions and that it tended to take us on very narrow roads when there was sometimes a much better road going to the same destination. After a few days, we routinely checked its directions against the map. It was, however, invaluable driving through cities and towns and I would definitely use it again."

I have a 64 bit machine but I installed the 32 bit version to play it safe and feel out the bugs if any. I have not had any bugs at all, but I have had one or two programs that where not compadible but they are not crutial apps.Vista is far more intuitive than XP SP2. Setting up a wireless home network took about 5 minutes and I installed my Xbox 360 with no issue's. I am very surprised at how smooth the transition has gone. This software is a hardware hog.I have an AMD 64X2 3800 processor and 2G of RAM and it uses at least 50% of this to do basic functions, Its ok with me but if you barely meet the minimum requirements of the software don't bother until you upgrade your hardware.PS I started with a FRESH copy of XP SP2 before the upgrade."

Before the Quickbooks can be used, the purchaser must log onto their website and jump a number of hurdles, which include denying their attempts to rope you into buying updates you don't need and services that may not be appropriate to your business.

I will tell you how to use it with a game in a minute.Please buy the Masterpiece edition of Myst. I've examined it. And this edition does give clues! I would still buy the book no matter what. You will get a giant picture of Myst Island which is worth the price itself. Remember too, the graphics are better in the Masterpiece Edition.2 hours. 3, 4, 5, 10. You decide. But I have figured out that if the player will time the amount spent in this game according to a certain regimen, then enjoyment is maximized while the pain of frustration is decreased. In other words, if 10 hours have passed without ANY forward movement, it's time to cheat a little. Just start reading the book until you get one clue. Then give yourself another 5 or 10 hours. But stick to the same time. If you do go forward, start your clock all over again.Some of the websites are beautiful for hints. As well as friends. But this is your journey! They may blurt out too much at one time. Believe me.I wish I had done this. I went to the back of the book and zipped right through the game! My brother got stuck and must have put in 20 or 30 hours before he started bumping his head on the wall!Well, I guess you are ready to go. You will no doubtedly start at the dock and go into the library behind the trees. These is truly a great game. Just wonderful for teens and adults alike. Just keep your cool.

47652,0,"I bought this game for twenty dollars. All that came in the box was the cd in a paper envlope. I expected that for such a cheap game. The game came loaded with different buildings, ski lifts, and other structures. Only problem is that to unlock the better buildings, you need to build the more basic structures first. This may seem okay. Its the driving force in the game, but it takes forever to get the good buildings. You start off with $50,000 in easy mode. Building a few building and a ski lift will put you into debt. Now its time to make money. It'll take you at least half an hour to make $10,000 back, and then you spend that money on a new condo and your back in debt. Graphics are good, but the music is horrible. You can only hear it when you zoom out. Overall, turn the game on, leave town for a few days, and then you'll have enough money to play."
50409,1,This game exceeded my expectations! I thought cheap game meant cheap product - but this is a great game for my 3.5 year old twins. They sat for over an hour one day sharing the mouse and navigating through the game without arguing with each other. I was surprised that they were able to use the mouse to navigate but the game really helps them learn when they can click on items. They also learned some problem solving skills since the clues need to be gathered in succession. I have ordered another Freddi Fish game - hope it is as good as this one has been.

Second, when I tried an earlier version of OS X, none of my peripherals worked. And third, I was loathe to give up an old and trusted friend who I had gotten VERY used to - The Mac OS ( from version 7-9).I finally broke down and bought Jaguar because these three criticisms, and many more, have been finally, and fully addressed. Every software title I use save one, is now OS X native, all of my peripherals work fine if not better (as is the case with my tempermental external CD-R), and I am quickly becoming used to my new friend, who has turned out to be a vastly superior OS.OS X (Jaguar) is a pleasure to use and isn't as difficult as I thought to get used to. Now is definately the time to switch if you haven't already done so. OS X is the future of the Mac and it is bound to make that future a bright one."

22088,2,"This year I tried Taxcut on the Mac instead of Turbotax on a PC(which I've been doing for 4+ years). Taxcut was only so-so.Printing to pdf's (a feature built into Mac OS X) isn't that great with about 2 duplicating lines between page breaks (2 lines at the bottom of one page duplicate onto the top of the next page; and the page break isn't that clean). Turbotax (last year) on the PC had an option to print to pdf's (which I do for archival and burn to a CDROM; don't generally print the 50+ pages of my return) and that was always perfect. Everything was formatted perfectly, and with &quot;bookmarks&quot; (no bookmarks in Taxcut, but that's probably because it doesn't print to pdf's directly). Turbotax also included printing all the final electronic filing status pages with DCNs, etc. Taxcut doesn't have any of that. Also I had various problems entering lots (12-30 stocks) sometimes getting duplicate entries (workaround, delete everything from the first duplicate to the end and reenter). I reported these problems but HR Block just said they don't support doing pdf's and didn't offer much on the capital gain entries (poor print formatting is a nuisance, but messing up the capital gain listing is a major problem and can be time consuming to double-check everything). I'll probably try Turbotax on the Mac next year (not sure I want to buy Taxcut next year to see if they've fixed any of these things and put up with more nuisances and major glitches). I prepare at least 3 returns each year with these products and am truly disappointed with Taxcut 2003 &quot;Premium&quot; for Mac."
94842,1,"This product is great. The best part is that it will convert PDFs to OCR WITHOUT CHANGING THE FORMAT - so what you see in the PDF is what you get after the conversion, not a muddled mess. This includes graphics, photos, legal pleadings, etc. You do have to go through and double check for typos - but the conversion rate is about 98%. I am not aware of any other program that will do the conversion as well. Well worth the money if you do PDF conversions. And if you just want to convert documents to PDF, without all the other bells and whistles that Adobe gives you, it is very functional for that too."

68349,1,"I am a huge fan of Adobe Photoshop Elements from the get-go. I've had every version or nearly so since its inception. Designed as a ""cut-down"" version of Photoshop, the granddaddy of digital image manipulation software, Photoshop Elements is aptly named; it has the elements of Photoshop that most users need, but minus the extra bells and whistles that professional designers might require.That power of course comes at a price; I found that my 3 year old HP Pavilion needed significant upgrades to run version 5.0. Slow to do graphics in any case, due to onboard Nvidia graphics chips, I added a separate graphics card (a reasonably inexpensive one) and some additional memory since my computer was underpowered in that regard as well. The addition to 1GByte of RAM and the dedicated graphics card made loading and running Photoshop Elements 5.0 possible. It went from molasses and swearing a lot to slick as a cat's hindquarters.So: Lesson #1--if your computer doesn't have a dedicated graphics card and is underpowered in RAM, consider upgrading or replacing a superannuated model. Ask your local computer guru if you are unsure.Now, down to the improvements in the software.1. Enhanced conversion to black & white from color. While ""remove color"" and sepia (or any) toning was always available, there is now a set function to create black & white from your color digital photo. I use this a lot. As a former person who did her own B&W; in the darkroom as a kid, I have of course no time as an adult to process film and Heaven knows printing one print can take hours. I created a handsome photo of some wicker chairs on an old porch in record time with this feature.2. You can delight your kids (or yourself) by making photo flipbooks--the precursor to movies. Fun and educational. A lovely little feature for homeschoolers and kids' activities.3. More options for fancy frames, collages. This is in answer to the scrapbooking craze. There are many more ways to make enhanced pictures and photos for digital printing to cards, scrapbook or just to email to friends. Photoshop Elements also has an array of filters that let you make web thingies like glassy buttons and neon highlighted lettering for designing your home web page.4. As in PSE 4 and 3, you have the option to go from camera download to quick edit, without loading the full editing power of PSE. Organization of the photos and videos has been greatly enhanced in version 5.05. Along with organization, there is a new feature Map View which lets you tag your photos to where you took them. And you can share photos with some online features.6. There are brushes that replicate natural surfaces, natural brushes, fancy shapes. You can create artwork with or without photos by chosing colors, gradients, and add text and create drop shadows, bevels, and other features. You can change photos to have artist effects like pastel strokes or oil daubs.Downsides?1. I mentioned the slowness of loading if your computer is underpowered. To give this version a fair test, I upgraded my computer and I recommend you have a minimum of 1GByte RAM and a separate graphics card unless you have a very new, very graphics-oriented PC.2. If you are a current user of V. 3.0 or so, you may find it is hard to locate some features as they have been reorganized. I still find I have to re-learn how to do a few things because the menus have changed somewhat. The overall layout (drop menus and tabs in the tool sets) is the same.Finally, the Five-Hundred Dollar Question: Do I need Photoshop or Photoshop Elements? Here's what is NOT available:CMYK Mode (used for professional printingLAB color modesHigh-bit image tools.Multiple exposure overlays (HDR)Channels PaletteKeystroke macros (for repeat manipulations)Color Balance, Match ColorLayer Masks, Layer Comps, and Quick Mask modeSmart ObjectsSmart GuidesVanishing Point ToolCertain adjustment layers such as color balance, curves, selective color, and channel mixerA complete log of editing history (you can back up using Ctrl-Z but you can't record what you did for batch processing)Some advanced text formatting and layer style manipulationno Advanced Color Management, Advanced Web features or ImageReady features like image slice and image rollover (for web design)Custom menus, setting, anything for batch processing of this sortBottom line: if you are a skilled web designer, intend to send images to professional printing or do high-output, repetitive tasks in Photoshop, you are a pro and need the full edition. For the rest of us, PSE 5.0 really does the job. Big thumbs up."

2580,0,"The Traffic Seeker Professional edition, does what it claims. It is the best SEO engine for the price. You can submit to websites in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Asia. This version only allows you to submit to less than 200,000 locations. If you want to submit to the FFA sites, you have to pick and choose or upgrade which could cost you as much as $299.My usual solution is to submit to the regular Google Germany, France, etc. Then use the same project to submit to a few of the FAA sites. It may take two submissions but it is worth. If you are familiar with FFA you are going to get a lot of confirmation email so it best to have a email address set up for that."

88539,1,"This is the best software out there! My daughter was just shy of 3 when we bought it and I feared she may have trouble with it but I was wrong. It has a nice variation in its different levels of play which can challenge her for a long time. The program uses a wonderful mix of phonics and sight reading skills that blend nicely to maintain her interests. (Face it! Phonics OR memorizing words alone can be very boring!) The reward system is top notch-she earns tickets along the way and after 6 tickets she gets a prize. The prize machine looks like one of those at the carnival gizmos with an arm which decends upon a wrapped mystery gift. (A fun game in and of itself.) Then, at seemingly unpredictible times, she is also rewarded with a new Clifford book which she can color and print if desired. The book uses only those words which she has been working with. SHE read the very first one to ME! I was floored! The best part? She can read the book into the computer via microphone and play it back to herself. (Do I have to describe what a hit that was?) Activities have such variety as pick the missing letter, the correct word or spell your own word. Only drawback we can find is that when spelling your own word, you are limited to four letters and Jaclynn's curiosity is not limited to four letters. (Mommy, how do you spell supercalifrajilisticexpialidocious?)"
69021,1,I have been using an earlier version of Terrain Navigator for years and have found it indispensable to my work as a groundwater hydrologist in providing on-screen topo maps from the U.S. Geological Survey. Now this updated version is even better as there are more options for viewing and printing the maps or portions thereof. An excellent product. I don't know what I would do without it.

86847,1,"I love Quicken, and have been using it for about 3 years. I've tried MS Money, and find Quicken a lot easier to use. That said, I'd call Quicken 2001 a minor release that doesn't really add much over Quicken 2000.The user interface, especially for the &quot;My Finances&quot; home page, looks quite a bit different. I'm not sure its better, just different. It more closely resembles the quicken.com website. For people who use both, this could be a plus. I've also found a few minor bugs that will hopefully be fixed in future updates.I was hoping Quicken 2001 would automatically download stock quotes every 10-15 minutes; it doesn't. One would think this would be an obvious fallout of merging Quicken 2001 with quicken.com. Heck, many brokerages offer free real time quotes over the Internet these days. The PIN vault still asks for a password every time you download, even if you've already typed it in earlier.Quicken still lacks a comprehensive ability to track insurance policies (life, auto, health, home) or provide estate planning advice. I would like to see something similar to the retirement planner for estate and insurance planning.Overall, I'm still very happy with the product. I'm hoping that Intuit is focusing their creative ideas on Quicken 2002, and that we'll see some great new features next year."

My main Pros are that things that pointlessly took forever can now be done really quickly. Also, some features have been greatly expanded. My cons are that it is too ""automatic"". Sometimes, you need to do things manually, whih often isn't in XP. Also, I've already noticed some software compatibility probs. Could be better, could be worse.

84268,0,"I installed new guts in my computer and decided to give Vista a try. What the heck? Fortunately Vista recognized my new SATA2 drive (XP required a driver disk during install). I say ""fortunately"" because the motherboard manufacturer (gigabyte) does not currently have Vista drivers. This is VERY ironic since the box says ""Windows Vista Ready"" right on the front! Hmm... I never could get the built-in network adapter working. Who needs a network anyway? Oh wait, there's that internet thingy that's kind of fun. It's also the place where I download the kuh-zillion OS bug fixes. Yep, I need a network. The choices were clear: I could either go buy a new network adapter and use one of my PCI slots, or try to upgrade XP (complete with all application software) instead of doing a Vista clean install. The upgrade worked like a charm, which tells me that the XP drivers work fine on Vista but the setup utility wouldn't allow it. (Using ""compatibility"" mode didn't work either.) What a pain!I have shared my pain, now let me share my gain. I actually like Vista! The interface is slick, and believe it or not, I find it to be FASTER THAN XP. I have not run benchmark utilities; this is only my perception. Since I had the opportunity to run both XP and Vista on the new (and very powerful) hardware, I believe the comparison is valid. ""How can that be?"" you ask. ""XP has a much smaller footprint"". What's up with that? In my humble opinion, XP is far superior on legacy hardware (2+ years old), but Vista utilizes newer hardware more effectively -- especially copious amounts of RAM (2 gig+). From looking at task manager on both systems, one difference is obvious: XP allocates memory in a way where a portion of it is always ""available"" -- AKA not being used. Vista allocates all of it. The philosophy: If you ain't usin' it, Vista will. If you need more, Vista will release it from cache and give it to you. This makes sense. Why should there be a sizeable chunk of memory just sitting there when the OS can use it for system cache? Admittedly, I do not run a huge variety of software on my machine, so my comments should be taken with a grain of salt. That beig said, everything works so far! Yee haw! I have read comments by others who have not had good luck running their existing software. This shouldn't be surprising to those of us who upgraded to XP when it was released. People who HATED XP usually had trouble with two things: 1) Application compatibility, and 2) Hardware support. They also said that Microsoft released XP too early and that it had too many bugs. Sound familiar???"
66709,1,"What a breath of fresh air! Puts Outlook to shame and is really a ""must-have"" for any account salesperson. Manages your relationships at every step throughout the sales process. Maintains a running history of all calls, e-mails, and letters to and from a contact (which you can pull up at a moment's notice to quote to a prospect if they ""remember"" things differently than you do). Also allows you to group contacts and companies with common denominators for easy marketing. ACT! is not the only software that can do this effectively, but for me the final choice was between ACT! and GoldMine. Any PIM will be a little hard to use for a first-timer, but ACT! is notably easier to learn and use than GoldMine. ACT! crashes once in a while and has a few bugs, but I've never used a software product that was always stable. True, GoldMine is a little more powerful in a few areas, such as creating search groups through its Filter feature, but ACT! really has everything you need and doesn't clutter up your brain and your RAM with a bunch of complex features that you rarely use. Also, there is now a piece of software available that links my ACT! contacts to my accounts receivable processes in QuickBooks, and that was probably the clincher. If you have any doubts, download both ACT! and GM trial versions and try them both at once for free--that's what I did and I found myself naturally gravitating toward ACT! from Day One of the trial period."

76178,1,"I originally bought this being very unfamilliar with Linux (I knew that it was a relatively new OS). I did a little research and found that this package camely highly recommended for beginners to the world of linux. I purchased this a week ago and that is when my world changed. The program installed in 30 minutes. The install tool guided me through partioning my system so that I could boot into windows or linux. After that was installed I advanced into the desktop environment selecting KDE at random. Inside I found everything that I need for day to day use of my computer (email, web browsing, an office suite, multimedia players, etc...). Since I installed this I haven't looked back. the biggest testimoney comes from my wife who has adapted to the new OS very easily. We now only use windows to play games.

There's parts of it that help you fix, crop, alter photos, which I have other software for already...and the lay-out pages for printing that I didn't need either. If you're looking for something that does it all, this will work. If you're like me and hoping more for just the advanced graphics to make albums, then there's a bit of a waste here. The graphics are very impressive though and there IS a quite bit of variety with almost unlimited number of variations. It's a decent price for what you get. Oh...and the albums are HUGE files...especially if you turn them into movies (avi) to burn to DVDs... I've already had one at 12gigs. So have plenty of harddrive space ready."

32777,0,"In fact, at one time, it WAS better. The same people that produced this version had a much better one back when they published their DOS version years ago. I had hoped for something approaching that excellent package--and in truth, this one approaches it, but doesn't quite reach it.In the minus column, you have to run it from the CD. I truly dislike software that makes me do that. They seem to have loaded it up with features I don't want or need, including music that is distracting and graphics that, while nice, don't really add to the I Ching readings.In the plus column, however, those graphics are really beautiful and they're very well done. The readings are fine, especially if you have a copy of one of the I Ching volumnes handy to shed a little more light on the subject. I am not convinced that these readings are as insightful as those on the original DOS package, but these generally outshine other computer generated I Ching readings.If not for the need for the CD every time I run it, I'd give this one four stars--but the CD requirement is an annoyance I'd rather do without. I'll use it, but not as often as I would otherwise."

91361,1,"I recently purchased the Scrapbook Factory Deluxe ver. 2.0 software. So far, I believe that this is one of the best software products on the market today. It is very user-friendly, and without much of a learning curve. You can produce impressive scrapbooking pages, in a matter of minutes. However, the problem comes in when you create scrapbooking pages with more than 12 pictures and text on a page. If you do not print that page as soon as you finish creating it, trying to save it and print it later, is impossible. What happens usually, is that the page with all of your hard work will usually crash, and you end up starting all over. This can be quite disappointing. Secondly, even with a new printer, when you put a full page border on your page, there have been many occasions, where the border would not print correctly on the bottom of the page, and some of it would get chopped off. Lastly, as a friendly suggestion, more templates are needed for the areas of Graduation, Kwanza, Anniversaries, Halloween and Easter. Other than the few bugs mentioned above, ""Good Job, Nova Development""! I'm looking forward to your next new and improved version."
65297,1,I have had .Mac for a few years now and if you shop around you can renew for around $60 a year. For me that's cheap for what you get. Even if you don't use iDisk much or even publish a web page. It's there when you want too. But Mail is more then worth the $60. It is even better when you have two Mac's because iSync keeps both computer's sync up. It's Great!
72032,1,"After several trial software downloads and weeks spent attempting to find ONE program that allows me to work with my RAW images taken with my Sony Alpha100 DSLR. BibblePro works the best, has a user friendly interface, and most importantly when I contacted them their response was timely, friendly and complete. They care about their customers needs and attempt to help. It is very difficult to find one program that will handle all the various issues involving digital imaging. Every camera and lens has a different effect. Each camera manufacturer includes some utility for image transfers and minor processing but few can, or, do a complete job.This product BibblePro has some Ninja Noise filters included, but for the full benefit, I suggest you do as I did and also purchase the full version Noise Ninja 2. Combined there is not a program that is as easy to make ""developing"" digital images easier.Now I use Adobe PhotoShop for image enhancing post production work and BibblePro to make sure that the RAW to TIF processing is the finest available. In many cases I do not even need to use my old favorite Adobe PhotoShop for simple web postings and JPG output. Though I do not think I will ever stop using it.The combination of BibblePro4.9.9, NoiseNinja 2 and Adobe PhotoShop is a great work flow for digital imaging. All three cooperate with each other for their special abilities through plug-ins or as stand alone programs.Someday one program might handle the whole ""process"" of RAW or JPG digital images, but for now this is the best system I could assemble."

58524,0,"I purchased this map set for my eTrex Vista HCx unit on 8/4/2008. It worked fine, but it was not the latest version. When I installed it I was immediately notified by the installer program that there is an update available. Next I got on Garmin's web site and it said you can get a free upgrade within 30 days of purchase. I called the next day and was told that, unfortunately, free upgrades do not apply to maps purchased separately from a GPS unit. The update to City Navigator North America 2009 would have cost me $75 on top of the $80 I just paid Amazon for the DVD. It seems like this is probably a common problem (stale versions in inventory), but the fact that you immediately have to pay for an upgrade to get current doesn't sit well with me. Most other software products include at least one free upgrade so you are starting with the most current version. I think Garmin should be dinged for this unreasonable policy. As a result of this situation, I returned the City Navigator 2008 version and will order the 2009 version directly from Garmin. I am not happy about this, but I like the GPS unit, so I will begrudgingly go through the hassle."

Amazon was offering 2007 for $99.99 ($50 cheaper than anywhere else) and just by registering my product by September, I could download the new Office 2010. I'm so glad I went this route. I saved money and I love both Office 2007 and 2010. It is well worth your hard earned money to buy Office 2007 with the free upgrade!"
88395,0,"I have used the much older version of this product '3D Home Architect Deluxe' for several years. I am in the midst of a complete remodel of my home, and wanted more capabilities. After reading the description for BH&G; Home Designer Deluxe, I thought I would give it a try, as there were several limitations to my version that I wanted to get fixed. I have been very disappointed in this new version. While the user interface is much improved and the 3D objects are much more realistic looking, basic functionality has not improved much in my opinion. The stairway tool still needs much work, printing is cumbersome, and some very simple capabilities are only available in the PRO version. For example, changing the size of your floor joists is not possible in this version, which seems like a very minor thing to add. That's pretty significant when trying to plan stairs and riser/tread sizes. Dimensioning is confusing. The tool, in trying to do things automatically, won't let you draw things the way they currently exist. Some capabilities have actually been lost in moving to this new version. Concrete piers for foundations for example. You can draw them, but the dimensioning tool will not recognize them.I know pickin's are slim for affordable tools, and this tool does give you the basics and is useful especially if you have never used a program like this before. However, if you have used similar tools in the past, I don't see much to gain other than glitz.Most of the online help and tips are directed to the PRO version, and the solutions offered do not apply to this Deluxe version.I have been tempted to move up to the PRO version, but have low confidence that it will provide the features and fixes I am looking for."
42559,1,So far I am very pleased with this product. I seem to get a faster response on my laptop than I did with XP. There are still a lot of features I need to familiarize myself with and I do that a little at a time. Like I said no complaints so far.

20932,1,"Development of the product appears to be languishing but it's still a great product for keeping track of recipes and accumulating recipes off the web. It's a steal for the price! The webgrabber does not work well in Windows 7 but RecipeFox, an add-on for the FireFox browser offers greater functionality and works fine to capture recipes off the web into MasterCook. The shopping list feature could be more intelligent but is a very handy feature to lessen the anxieity of ""do I have all the ingredients I need?"". The abilities to search on, categorize and rate recipes is very handy.To me, tackling a printed cookbook is about as daunting as reading the Bible cover-to-cover. MasterCook is like a Google search engine, making the vast complexity of cooking accessible to searching and bookmarking in as many ways and dimensions as you'd like. offering a personalized cooking experience and diary.EDIT (1/18/2011): After a year of using MasterCook 9, I've switched to Living Cookbook 2011, using MC as a companion, helper product. My recommendation is to get both programs. MasterCook 9 because it's inexpensive ($6 or less), hasn't changed much in the 2011 version, and v9 has more recipes and techniques, including video illustrations, than Living Cookbook 2011. However, Living Cookbook 2011 is a far more powerful and coherent program allowing you to also manage ingredients, pantry (inventory) items, your glossary and your techniques reference libraries (TIPS in MC) as full-fledged citizens of the program. So if you use MasterCook as your reference and Living Cookbook as your working cookbook manager, you'll come out ahead. Recipes easily import out of MasterCook and into Living Cookbook.

We have no plans to upgrade to Office 2007 on the Mac. Heavy duty Powerpoint and Word documents will remain on the XP platform as NeoOffice still has a few glitches with these documents."
60023,1,"This worked out fine and does what I need. Sure, I'll upgrade to Vista some day, along with the corresponding version of Office. But it'll require a new laptop. Meanwhile I've got this pretty thoroughly debugged, effective office productivity software to use on my inexpensive XP Home-using $500 Toshiba laptop."
69290,1,"I just received an offer for a ""dream"" job. I would attribute part of this success to Resume Maker Career Edition. Originally I wasn't going to get an interview because the interviewers weren't impressed with my resume. However, after one of the potential candidates couldn't meet, they approached me for an interview. I decided to run to Office Max and look for Resume software. Your product came highly recommended. I downloaded it into my PC and went to work. When I arrived at the interview, I gave them a new revised version of my resume. They were extremely impressed. The next thing I know I'm asked to fly to NJ for a second interview. This time I was meeting with upper level Executives. I used the Virtual Interview and practiced, practiced, practiced!! Well, apparently it worked! I got word yesterday that I will be receiving a final offer within 3 days. This position is a sales position where I will earn 6 figures my first year. This software had a hugh impact on my future."
70615,1,"Over all a great product. It does impact startup and shutdown speed. It more than tripled the time it takes for the computer to shut down once you click the shut down button (Windows XP). I do like the features better than other security systems I've tried, however."

The iWork program allows me to quickly create everything from a news letter to business documents.I previously used MS Works and MS Office on my old PC and was proficient with their uses. After two week's use of iWork, I am creating better quality documents in less time. I see the potential through the use of iWork for me to becoming a creative pro.This is an excellent product that will not disappoint. I am a very satisfied user and highly recommend this software suite of programs."

31320,1,"This is absolutely tremendous! If you ever owned the original Kirby-Lee Fantastic Four comics, and let them go for whatever reasons, or if you never had them, and want to see the World's Greatest Comic Magazine in the days when it truly lived up to that title, this is the way to go! No one who's gotten this far should pass it up... it's an unbelievable bargain and a wonderful item in these days of madness like comics slabbed in plastic, like Han Solo trapped in carbonite...Forget the Marvel Masterworks volumes... the reproduction ranges from shoddy to terrible, and the color is garish. Those reprints do a great disservice to these classic comics... the originals looked much better than they do in the Masterworks volumes! An example... Fantastic Four #5... in the Masterworks volume, on the very first page of the very first appearance of Doctor Doom, black splotches inexplicably obliterate most of Doom's mask...there's no excuse for that! That wasn't there in the original, and it's not here in the scan!If you don't own the original comics, and aren't wealthy enough to buy the originals, this is the way to go. The scans are very good, high resolution. Here, you see all the linework that gets clotted in the Masterworks volumes, and you can zoom in and really study all the details of that great Kirby machinery, otherworldly architecture, and cosmic panoramas! I've had a big grin on my face from the moment I looked at the first page... this is what comics are all about... pure, unadulterated, cosmic fun!The original letter pages and ads are a real treat, too... the whole experience is time travel!Oh, yeah... you also get 34 years of non-Kirby Fantastic Four issues... ;-)Please note! If you have a Mac, and are having difficulties with this dvd, here are some tips.Are you opening it with Preview? If you just click on the icon on the disk, it will open in Preview... but this will not work properly. You must use Adobe Reader to see the pages without the watermark.Install Adobe Reader from the dvd.Make an alias of Adobe Reader and put it in the Dock.Click and open the dvd icon.Click and open the decade folder.Don't open the year folder... click and drag the pdf icon, (such as FF_1960.pdf), onto the Reader alias in the dock to open.Click on year.Click on month.Click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size.Enjoy all that cool Kirby machinery bigger than you've ever seen it!I hope this is helpful!"

If you want 4x6 or other sizes, then it sets the size just right and keeps me from having to remember all the numbers.When its time to share photos, the software can link to the photo finale web site that allows family and friends to see the photos. I have used the software for sharing photos of my kids team for several tournaments with other parents and relatives. The web site has a slide show feature that is great and when someone sees one they like, they can save it. I don't need to email photos now unless I want to.There are other features that my wife and I like, but too many to list them all."
49406,1,"Pros: Nice interface, decent integrated firewall, integrated antispyware (though weak)Con:"
10905,0,"First: Product is pricey. Avoid it unless you absolutely need it.Second: Bad interoperability between Mac and Windows versions. If you use the grab utility to copy/paste screenshots into Word, etc. and expect the document you created to open on a PC, better have Quicktime and TIFF decompressor. (Who had that bright idea?)Third: Virtual PC DOES NOT WORK on Intel Macs. Best platform is PPC G4/G5. It's a CPU hog on G3, even if you max out your RAM.Fourth: Here's the kicker. Better get a hold of software like Font Doctor and make sure you're running OS X 10.4+. Corrupt fonts will cause Office apps to crash and burn. Recommend removing all fonts except OS-provided fonts, run font doctor and repair all fixable fonts, then use the Font Book supplied by OS X Tiger (10.4) to bring them back in. Don't forget to reboot between removing fonts and re-adding them. You'll save a world of trouble in doing this."

9375,0,"There are two upgrade rebates for this bundle for 2004, one for the Norton SystemWorks, which is listed for this product, and one for the Norton Personal Firewall, which is not, but it is listed under the individual product (Search Norton Firewall 2004).Combined with the occasional Amazon 'bundle' rebate, you can get this for free. Which, considering some of the reviews, might be what it is worth to you. I haven't had problems other than it slowing down the bootup process, but this was on a fresh install on a new hard drive. It was painfully slow the first couple of days at startup, until XP 'cached' it or something."
67918,1,"This program has lots of projects for you to choose from. It is easy to use, also. The biggest downfall is that the photo fixing and enhancing are not the greatest. You are limited to a few minor fixes on the photo itself, and enhancing is the same. You can enhance a lot better with Creating Keepsakes. Neither program has much to actually fix a photo. If you are looking for photo enhancing and fixing, move on. If you want great projects for everything from photos to making coloring book pages for kids, this is for you."

70954,1,"I purchased this game for my husband for Father's Day, but it is so fun, the whole family works on it together! It is a game of puzzles which you have to figure out what you need where to make the desired outcome. It is a good problem-solving game for the kids (mine are 6 and 7 years old)and parents alike. They can also create their own experiments, which my 7 year-old particularly likes. I highly recommend!"
5719,0,"I switched to TaxCut from TurboTax because reviews said it was as good as TurboTax but without TurboTax's copy protection scheme. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Entering Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) transactions was much more difficult than last year's TurboTax. The capital gains wizard was almost no help. The online instructions and help were much less helpful, and the help had a much poorer index.Overall, I would say TaxCut 2003 is about as good as TurboTax was 2-3 years ago. But it is not nearly as easy to use as TurboTax was last year. As much as I dislike TurboTax's copy protection scheme, I will go back to TurboTax next year."
90154,1,"OVERVIEW: Flash 5 represents a significant upgrade from its predecessor, making it a ""must have"" for any serious web developer who wants to develop high-impact web content. The improvements are not superficial, instead Flash 5 impressively enhances the developer's ability to design, develop, and deploy. This tool is the resource for anyone who is serious about Flash and maximizing its amazing potential at a rapid pace.At RAYHAWK.COM we have been using Flash to enhance our web productions for the last 2 years and the results have been noticeable, not only to us, but to our clients (KFC, Taco Bell, BMW, Porsche, Deltamedical.com).WHY FLASH? With Flash player's pervasive presence in a majority of all browsers, Macromedia's Flash has become the industry standard for delivering high-impact web animations and dynamic site content.THE COMPETITION: What competition? Macromedia is the creator and leader of this technology and Flash is the master of this domain with no other product coming even close to its innovation and power. Adobe's marginal attempt to introduce a competing product with Live Motion was not well received by developers and is comparatively lacking in features. The most significant proof that Flash owns this entire arena is that even competitor wanna-be, Live Motion features Flash animation (*.swf) as an export format because Adobe is painfully aware that nobody would invest in their product if it did not support Flash.FLASH 5 FEATURES:1. POWER LIBRARY - Flash's Library feature has received a big boost in version 5. The library allows users to reuse graphics and buttons repeatedly with a minimal increase in the final file size. In Flash 5 multiple developers can share the symbol libraries. Now revising the placeholder graphics into the final artwork on one system, will ripple back to all other Animators document instantly... a great feature for multi-group workflow.2. ADVANCED ACTION SCRIPTING - resembling Java-script, the scripting can be created and edited in any text/html editor and imported into Flash for use; old script can be viewed without searching through frames of individual code-chunks.3. ENHANCED INTERFACE - many controls are now available in dock a able palette, which ultimately allows more development efficiency.4. FULL BEZIER SUPPORT - but its gets better... the option to draw with the traditional pencil is retained allow optimal developer flexibility.5. POWER EDITING - the developer is now permitted to instantly edit what they want and where. Endlessly searching a document's layers of imbedded symbols is over. A hierarchical tree allows for easy navigation and editing of flash symbols.6. HTML EMBEDDING - To really change the balance of power Flash 5 makes it possible to imbed actual HTML pages within Flash Documents so now sites will become Flash shells with HTML inside, rather than vice-versa.7. NO LOST VISITORS - Publish html that detects if your visitors have Flash 5 player and automatically directs them to Macromedia's download center if needed.8. OTHER ENHANCEMENTS - improved XML transfer support within documents; improved integration with Freehand and Generator; seamless importing of MP3 soundtracks; and exporting to QuickTime.CONCLUSIONS: At RAYHAWK.com we have used Flash technology to successfully enhance our projects and exceed our client's expectations for the last 2 years. With the launch of Flash 5 Macromedia has solidified its position as the premier developer of powerhouse web content. Macromedia Flash 5 is an outstanding upgrade for any developer already using Flash and for those newcomers to the web arena this is AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT!!!"

39751,2,"The problem with Norton Ghost is that it seems to have problems with some computers and settings, and if it does, it is impossible to get it to work, or to get any meaningful help from the folks at Norton.My wife and I own different Toshiba laptops. For hers, Ghost works perfectly. For mine, installing Ghost causes my computer to blue-screen every time you turn it off, and it never successfully made a backup.As a PC technical support guy, that's what I see in the world. When it works, it's golden. When it doesn't, no power on earth will budge it.Buy it, and if it doesn't immediately work for you, uninstall it and move on to some other product."

38150,1,"In this collection there are two games:The Legacy of Rosemond Hill and Competitions at Rosemond Hill. Competitions at Rosemond Hill is so boring!! I only played it once for about 5 minutes! It is NOT fun! But The Legacy is! Competitions is the only one that installed on our computer though. My Dad had to work on it for about 45 minutes to get it installed properly. The Legacy of Rosemond Hill is fun but it is very unrealistic. When you are riding your horse there is a stamina bar. If you let the horse get to tired and the pulse get to high he will rear. So you have to be careful with how long you hold the up arrow key down. First of all, horses are animals built for running long distances with no breaks, and are built with much endurance. They have strong muscles built for it. So they wouldn't get to tired. Second of all, if they did get tired they wouldn't rear. Horses just stop when they're tired. This unneeded detail makes the game that much harder. Also horses do gallop. But not in this game. I know it sounds like this game is stupid. But its not. Those are just little details. If you have a lot of patience with games and are a horse lover I would definitely recommend this game. If you are not a horse lover than it isn't worth it. But other than these things, I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!"
9716,1,"Really super software for the HTML ignorant among us. It really is just the most intuitive and easy to use software with a lot of really good features. The two recent sites I've designed with it are [...]and [...] if you want to take a look.The only darn problem is the support you get or rather don't get. It literally took me ages to realise that the Flash media buttons supplied with the package whilst working great ono Internet Explorer (the site is biased to work with Internet Explorer) just wouldn't render with Firefox. I asked the website forum for help with this problem, but six months later they still hadn't answered me on their site. In the meantime I worked it out for myself with the help of one of those nice techy people who I found on an internet webforum who very happily helped me work it out. Its fine now. if you have the patience to work round such problems as these yourself I reckon you will eventually work it out on your own, but honestly its really scary not being able to have any kind of support from Namo. The telephone at Namo on their helpline is never answered and they don't even have the good grace to respond to e-mails. This is such a setback when the software they have produced is so very very good"
26130,1,"Dreamweaver is well beyond its opponets in web-design, and anybody who designs web pages should have this program! Packing every single tool you would need or ever want to make your website the way you want it, Dreamweaver is easy from the start. Although I'm not an actual owner of Dreamweaver, I have friends who own this product, and every one of them has been blown away bit it, including me. This program is easy to use, and for those who are still using old programs like &quot;Visual Page&quot;, I suggest that you upgrade to this program, which you will never regret. Many people still stick with the old fashioned way of making mouse-overs, but Dreamweaver makes it easy, and this can be done in under a minute, without having to spend hours on Java coding. I personally like this program much more then Adobe &quot;GoLive&quot;, which are the two leading web-design programs. Make your choice, but I think Dreamweaver is the true program that will make every website look incredible. It's worth the price tag, every cent! The day will come soon when I hope to have the priviledge of owning this program myself."
57821,1,"Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice!"

If i were you, i would just rent it from blockbuster, after you have played for 1 hour and a half, itll be boring and you can return it.

My daughter tried both, she likes this very much just because:1. It can systemmatically teach her pronunciation, practice sinlge sound, word and sentence.2. Setup her own pace to learn, review and practice.3. Recording your own voice to find out the difference in between4. Much more rich functions and useful links to play if you want to be an advanced user.since she's been practiced with PP, she is very seldom to request a audiologist to correct her pronunciation. That all be great if we could spot this software early. Plus the service is excellent, promptly and helpful.I think it's the best so far on the market and strongly recommend it especially for those hearing impaired kids to pratice total English at school.Jim Lin, New Jersey"
64319,1,"When I bought my Macbook Pro I spent $50 on a 1 year subscription to LoJack (I frequented a college campus...frequently). Just 10 months later, my car was broken into downtown and sadly, my computer was taken. I subsequently filed a police report and immediately reported the theft to LoJack. This was fairly simple because the serial number was already on file with LoJack. There was decent GPS tracking signals for a while but then it went silent. Then, just when I had lost hope (around 3 months later), LoJack sent me an email requesting my purchase order invoice because they planned on reimbursing my money. I was thrilled. Because I had only owned the computer for under a year I was going to be reimbursed about 80% of the cost. I happily began collecting my documents for submission, but never had to hand them over because guess what, the computer finally picked up a good signal-from nowhere other than...Mexico!! LoJack tracked my computer all the way to Mexico and had it returned. The police verified the serial number and today I open the door to my good-new fashioned Macbook Pro. Thanks for not letting my stuff get Jacked, LoJack."
86124,1,"Starry Night Pro (SNP)is an incredible software package. I had used used TheSky version IV for a few years (which was 2 1/2 times the cost), and SNP is MUCH easier to use, and offers features that TheSky simply does not have.It does help to have a pretty good background in Astronomy though, so I could see where someone with virtually NO knowledge on the subject would have a difficult time knowing where to start. Since they do offer more basic versions of Starry Night, I'd imagine that they might be more appropriate for a true beginner.Some of the highlights: Each time you run the program, you have the option of having the database updated via the Internet, so that all of your satellite, comet and asteroid information is current. This function is very easy... you don't have to go looking for it... it'll ask you at start up.You can &quot;center&quot; on any object, and zoom in (up to) a high-powered telescopic view. With the object centered in the field, the object will remain frozen in the center of your screen as time elapses, rather than moving across the screen. You can then set the time-step to anywhere from &quot;normal&quot; to 30,000x normal. One of the coolest things to do, is to center Saturn, zoom in until it fills about a quarter of the screen, and then speed the time up... You'll watch in amazement as the planet and it's splendid ring system rotate before you, and the moons dance around the planet.You can change your viewing location to anywhere on Earth... or for that matter, anywhere in the Solar System --and beyond. Try looking back at the Earth during a Solar eclipse! You'll see the Moon's shadow skirting across the surface. Or, if you set your viewing location on the Moon during a lunar eclipse, you'll see a Solar eclipse FROM the moon. Again, pretty neat.You can zoom completely out of the galaxy, and look back at the Milky Way so it is no longer a band across the sky, but rather a pinwheel of stars (depending, of course, on which direction you are looking from.) You can also zoom out to the edge of the known universe until all of the galaxies are a faint blob in the middle of the screen.... Zooming IN quickly from this point is also a cool effect.If all of what SNP did was for &quot;effect&quot; only (in other words, it didn't actually reflect the REAL sky, it'd be worth the money.) But of course, it DOES reflect what you CAN see. What you WILL see. And what you DID see. (Up to several thousand years in the past, and about ten thousand years into the future... just for planning purposes!)Starry Night Pro is worth every dollar... and more!"

19581,0,"Like every new version of AutoCAD, things get a little better or at least different. Being a consultant working with architects all over the country, ACAD is still the de facto drawing program. For much of my own work, it's still like using a 20 pound sledge hammer for finishing brads, but over the years I've gotten used to it. (I started with version 12 on a Mac.)The most annoying aspect is that you feel like you don't really own the program, but instead lease it from AutoDesk for a few years. ACAD 2005 was still fine for me, but small errors started to occur when I worked on 2007 files from architects. Just annoying enough to finally succumb to buying the new version.If you're an architect, I'm sure AutoCAD is a good, if expensive, tool. Many architects are using other programs now, but experience with ACAD will make those easier too, but patience is a virtue."

I know to back-up everything to a second drive including the OS, well in using Norton Ghost I read that when you backup the drive ""C:"" it wont backup the programs ""uh"". Let me put that a different way, I backup the main drive and it excludes all the programs you installed on that drive necessitating reinstalling all your programs if the drive fails, ""uh"" really? So I use the function ""Copy My Hard Drive"" instead and it works fine, cloning the drive and programs like it should, I hope, but it is not a bootable copy, really! You have to burn a recovery CD or use the supplied recovery CD, fair enough. Well in trying to burn a recovery/boot CD it failed twice at 96% and stopped. I don't trust this program, when I select ""Recover My Computer"" there is nothing in the list. They keep talking about ""Recovery Points"" but never explain what a ""Recovery Point"" is, how about ""recover backup"" instead or ""recover OS"" or something that makes sense, anything that makes sense.

My son is currently in ""Mo's Workshop"" learning about friction, electricity and circuits. Once inside the workshop the game lets kids pick out particular lessons they want to learn OR they can let the game do the choosing.Interspersed throughout the learning portions are little mini-games to keep kids engaged and reinforce what they've learned.

It just gives you all these complicated examples and they start out with the hardest verbs. When you're trying to learn Spanish verbs, you must know how to conjugate each verb. It doesn't even explain how to do this at all. The vocabulary flash card section is about the only thing I've been able to use but I even noticed a few errors with that. I already learned quite a bit of Spanish in school so I only bought this to brush up on what I already knew.

This may not be important to some users, but my digital camera only records Quicktime video and I want to use it in my family productions.

All of these problems are easily solvable, in fact do not even appear with SuSE. Intel's usb chipset does require a tweak, but it is documented at SuSE's website, and is easy to apply.Overall, this is the easiest Linux distribution to set up and use that I have ever seen.

You have to force her to quit to eat dinner and do her homework. Any little girl who loves animals (dogs, cats, rabbits, turtles, bunnies) will love this game. Parents may think it is not the best but my daughter and her friends are delirious about this game."

90748,1,"I am the last person you want to ask about Microsoft products, but this program seriously sets a new standard for note taking and organizational tools. I spend a lot of time on the phone taking notes from conversations with customers. This is the first product I have used that gets out of my way and just lets me take notes. The software is intuitive, easy to use and feature-rich enough that I really can't think of much that I would add. Yet there are not so many features that you are trying to figure out how to do simple tasks. I would highly recommend this product to anybody that wants to throw away their paper notebooks and move into the 21st century."

56612,1,"Our 2-year old daughter was fascinated by the computer, but all the age-appropriate software we had was either much to simplistic (actions required only banging on the keyboard to produce a result), or required a considerable amount of help from an adult due to the need to point and click. She was very interested in the mouse, but could never quite get the concept of pointing and clicking, which was always very frustrating for her.My favorite thing about Reader Rabbit Toddler is the method it uses for teaching little ones how to use the mouse. Making selections requires only moving the very large mouse pointer to an object on the screen, then holding it in place for about 5 seconds. A series of dots lights up, one at a time, with a pinging sound, to indicate that the object is going to be selected. This reduces accidental selections, and allows plenty of time to change your mind and move the pointer to a different object. (Clicking to select the object will also work, which our daughter caught on to very easily once she mastered the ""pointing"" part.) Within about 3 days, she was able to use the mouse to select and play the different games with very little help. After about a week, she could play completely unassisted, and had completely mastered pointing and clicking a short time later.The software provides a wide variety of activities, all of which are launched from the same ""home"" location, which is very easy to return to when finished with an activity. The activities are cute, colorful, and very fun for this age group. Activities including a coloring book, which requires only rapid movement of the mouse to fill in the pictures; a music activity, in which Reader Rabbit does finger plays for various familiar songs; some simple games involving letters and numbers; and some animal matching games. (There are some others, but I can't recall them off the top of my head.) It seems to me that the primary focus of the software is to be cute and entertaining enough to keep a child's attention while helping them to learn fundamental computer skills necessary for using any software.It has been about 3 months since our daughter first started using the software, and she has already moved on to other, more complex software (her current favorite is Jump Start Pre-K -- much better than Reader Rabbit Preschool.) I suppose that my only complaint about the software is that it didn't really ""grow"" with her ability, which would have made it last longer. Although, we probably would have gotten much more use out of it had we started using it when she was younger. (The box says ages 1-3, and I wouldn't hesitate to try it out with a 1-year old on my lap. I think a 3-year old would master it very quickly.)I would highly recommend this software to anyone who wants to introduce their toddler to the computer."

62498,0,"Microsoft Streets and Trips 2002 is a great program with basically every single street in America. It is great for general mapping and finding out addresses and other stuff like that, but when compared to the accuracy of Microsoft Expedia Trip Planner 1998, the reliability begins to fail. Streets and Trips 2002 adds random ramps at interchanges, leaves out forest and picnic areas, and displays many roads that aren't paved as passable to standard vehicles. It's also odd to note that many freeways, which opened up in 2001, were not on Streets and Trips 2002, including a major part of the 210 Freeway extension in southern California around Interstate 15. That's just one example of how the program missed out on updates that should have taken place. I hope 2004 is better; otherwise, I'll just wait until 2005 for an upgrade."

I didn't have to worry about the latest mountain of security flaws either."
81978,1,"I bought this from EBay in January 2004, and from what I see today Amazon is offering an excellent price.On first appearance, this software looks to be complciated to learn. The thing is, they packed it with more features than I personally would ever need. If you have the patience, you can really get some neat things out of the software. I played around with it, but eventually discarded the manual and started using it just like my old tape-drive 4-track recorder. Build-in metronome? Cool. Don't need it. Built-in effects? Might use it someday. Not today. So - you can get off the ground with the basic pretty quickly. One really neat thing is graphicly selecting regions that you want to punch in before hitting record. All in all, really good.There are a couple of clunky thing about it that you can work around easily - if you try to record a track before selecting an input device, for example, that track isn't going to work again (so just deleted it and make a new one). Double-clicking a Cakewalk file from file explorer results in an error, so bring up the application first, then load the file. I haven't run into any really drastic bugs, but makes me wonder when I will.Okay - my big beef - you have to pay extra to enable mixing down to MP3. I personally find it very obnoxious to buy a fully-featured, production piece of software - and then they want MORE MONEY - $30 - to enable what should be a standard feature. You can mix down to plenty of formats, sure, but let's face it, you'd expect MP3 to be a pretty standard format to use. I feel cheated and not respected as a customer of the product when the developers resort to this kind of money-grubbing.Well, I was going to give 2 starts because of the MP3 thing, but to be fair, overall this is a really nice piece of software, so it deserves a balanced review. Happy recording!"
76781,0,"I LOVE the product when it works!! I installed it on my personal computer and it worked for a few weeks then all of a sudden--- wouldn't work anymore! I emailed Rosetta Stone tech support --- in the mean time installed on my work computie, and it works. I have to have it on my home computer though! Tech support finally emailed back wanting to know if I had resolved the problem and if not to fill in this questionaire--- now a month later STILL NOTHING!! SO Basically their tech support is worthless and to pay this much for software you would think you could get tech support! I need to buy another language now but worried I may never get the support to have it on my private computer! :o("
1055,0,"I needed to get a copies of Access and Publisher for my new laptop which was running 2003 Office Standard. After Googling around a bit I determined that Office Professional would give me these plus the upgraded to 2007 Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook applications with a host of other features including Business Contact Manager for about the same cost. The install was reasonably painless and the software activated and registered without any problems - not always the case with Microsoft but this time they seemed to get it right. After using the applications for a couple of weeks I am still trying to get used to the ""Ribbon Bar"" which is markedly different, somewhat intuitive and decidedly more comprehensive. The applications take longer to initialize and Outlook has become painfully slower but works. I am running it on a Sony SZ230P with Intel Centrino Duo T2400 1.83 GHz running XP Pro with 2 gigs of RAM so maybe it is underpowered. I did uninstall the desktop search agent which seemed to make the system more sluggish and have now improved performance a bit. I am reasonably proficient in the Office applications but probably only use 5-10% of the functionality embedded - but I carry the overhead on the system which, I believe, bogs the system down overall. Would be nice if MS would allow the configuration of various levels of sophistication during the install process depending on the needs of the user. In summary, I will continue to use the Suite and become more proficient in using the ""Ribbon Bars"" and hoping that MS will issue some upgrades that speed up the system overall until I can afford to upgrade the laptop to a faster processor."

Even though TaxCut had an offer with MS Money (which I often use), TurboTax works far more smoothly with Money.

I was never asked about this in the &quot;Interview&quot; and had to hunt around the many deduction screens to find and check &quot;Other deductions.&quot; This is a fairly common and fairly new deduction, and should have been specifically mentioned.

31359,2,WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS GAME I WANTED IT SO BAD. I GOT IT AND PLAYED IT RIGHT OFF THE BAT. AND BOY WAS I DISSAPOINTED. THE GAME WAS POORLY MADE. I THOUGHT YOU COULD MAKE A LOT BETTER CARTOONS THEN THAT. THEY DON'T EVEN REALLY MOVE. AND THE SOUND CLIPS BITE. PEOPLE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT.

After three hours of playing (over a couple days) he had the entire puzzle solved! Even though he as on the easiest level, I feel the game should engage the child longer than that. After solving it, he would play the higher levels but they only make the math harder and do not introduce any new challenges.The games are well made, and our son was entertained, but I don't think much math was learnt."

70506,2,"For years, it was a regular occurrence to hear support techs tell me to disable Norton Anti-virus in order to work my way around a crash or malfunction. Unfortunately, it was the only thing besides Microsoft's pathetic offering that was available for Vista, and based on a glowing review from PC Magazine, I took the plunge.As I write, I'm looking at the 360 icon in the taskbar, with it's ominous red x and the tooltip telling me that there are 6 unresolved issues. I don't want it to defrag my disks, ever, but I haven't been able to figure out how to tell it that without getting the warning. The main interface won't open, no matter how I click on the icon.After weeks of being unable to get Live Update to work properly, a support tech told me to run the uninstall tool and re-install the program. This caused Windows Vista to crash and I spent about 6 hours fiddling with the Windows repair utility to get it to reboot. When I did finally reboot, the problem wasn't resolved and the support tech, with aplomb, advised me to re-run the uninstall tool, unfazed by my previous experience.Live Update is failing on my other installation, but I'm afraid to try to fix it.I'm sorry I got back in bed with Symantec."
58060,0,"My first review (for Danger by Design) was long(ish) so I'll try to keep this one short.I kind of like this game. If I could, I would rate it 2.5. 3 is only 1 less than my review for DBD (and I like that game). The Curse of Blackmoor Manor has fun parts and partly interesting characters, but overall it moves slowly and is tedious. I didn't like how you can't go outside in ""The Curse of Blackmoor Manor"". Usually I don't really mind, but there isn't much to do inside. I'm going to give the pros and cons of each character.Jane- Jane is the daughter of Linda, the person you are investigating. She is 12 years old. She also has a MAJOR passion for games. Also, a truk full of them. Which you can play. Acually, you have to play them in order to get certain things from Jane. In my opinion, her games aren't very fun.Linda-Linda hides beind a curtain and doesn't like answering questions. She is also convinced she is cursed and seems to enjoy giving warnings disguised as threats (or are they threats disguised as warnings?) Depending on what you say to her, different things will happen, none of them important or necassary.LouLou- a parrot! And the star of the show. Cute, talkative, funny, and smart- PLUS she gives hints! What's not like- ahem, LOVE?Ethel- You only talk to her about 3 times the whole game. She pops up- and I mean, she literally pops up- whenever you least expect it. I like her, but man, did she SCARE me!!! She doesn't seem to like Nancy much- but I like her!Nigel and Mrs. Drake- Not that interesting. Nigel, a historian, talks WAY TOO MUCH- AND is very boring. Mrs. Drake is OK but doesn't do much- just stands around, putting a damper on Nancy's ""fun"" (ahem)and Jane's, too and talking to her plants.This game seems to be a random assortment of puzzles that takes a LONG time to solve. It is scary in some parts but not much. I like the 1st quarter of the game. The rest is pretty hard and boring. If you like hard puzzles and history, this game is for you. If not- wait until someone gives it to you. :)"
82265,0,"""Quicken Willmaker Plus 2006 Estate Planning Software"" is an easy-to-use handy tool for anyone who has to author a written-will and/or similar legal document. The software has a well-designed layout. It runs on any Windows operating system, which is 95 or later version. It can be installed and configured in a shortwhile. Its operational tempo is nice; and, it does not tie-up systems resources as much as other 'Quicken software' like: ""Quicken Premier Personal Finance"" and ""Premier Home & Business"" do.However, the first negative sign users of previous editions will notice in this one is that very little has changed. As a result of this, it is difficult to see any good reason why those who own either the 2004 or the 2005 versions should bother themselves with upgrading to this 'new' version.In general terms, the naked truth is that most software manufacturers, who indulge in the production of yearly 'new versions', have very little or nothing to show for the money they ask. They often play on buyers' psychology by rearranging the graphical interface of their 'old' products, and then hype them up as 'new' and 'improved'. This explains in part, why most of the recently released 'new products' have more bugs than the 'older ones', which they are supposed to be replacing. And since most of the potential buyers believe that 'new' items are always better, they fall into the buying trap.What I have mentioned does not partain only to the makers of 'Quicken' products. It includes Microsoft, Adobe, Macromedia, Norton, McAfee, Corel, and so on. But, I hinted it here because I have conclusively inferred that this newly released ""Quicken Willmaker Plus 2006 Estate Planning Software"" is very much like the 'old' 2005 edition, which it suppose to replace. And, the 2005 version is as well, very similar to the 2004 version: in both design and function. So, how on earth can one justify all these calls for upgrade, if the trend persists as it currently is?In conclusion, I will advise any first-time buyer, who is considering this software, to gladly invest on it. It is by every means a good product. And, the retail price is reasonable enough. However, if you are an old-timer, who owns either the 2005 or the 2004 edition of this software, I will categorically tell you not to buy this 2006 edition. It is still functionally very similar to what you already have. So, why should you pay for it? Spending on this 'new version' won't be a wise decision at all. Just wait and see if there will be a real upgrade-worthy version coming out for you next year. Good luck!"

12583,1,"I'm probably one of those less popular reviewers because I am not a ""Microsoft-hater"". XP Pro sparkled at detecting all of the hardware associated with an HP Pavilion. Detection of a lot of hardware on ""bundle"" leaders like Compaq and Hewlett-Packard often tripped up prior Windows versions. About the only piece of hardware XP failed to detect was a Seiko Smart Label Printer Pro, which installed just fine with it's own software. Smart Label Printer Pro users beware! You must use advanced options and turn off those FIFO buffers on the COM port you are using the Smart Label Printer Pro on or it will cause a print fault. I believe this is an anomaly with the SLP, and not Windows.Another thing that impressed me about Windows XP Professional is that my klunky dialup modem connects at a consistently faster rate than it did under Windows ME. Some of this could be ambitious connection reporting, but my online sessions using a dialup seem more stable and faster and I am not disconnected as often.I seldom suffer the system crashes I experienced with previous versions from what I'll call the ""95 Family"" which means from Windows 95 through ME. XP seems to offer some of that ""NT"" stability for standalone computers.Some people don't like the new ""teletubbie"" rounded look. I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, but it's a pretty simple task to revert to the Windows classic view. Adding programs to the start menu isn't quite as easy in XP, but if you switch to classic view, it works as easily as prior versions.Although I haven't presented some of the negative aspects extant since Windows 3.11, my opinion is that Windows XP is a pretty neat, stable product and I'm enjoying using it!"
75086,1,"My review is really for Iview, which became Expression Media after Microsoft bought it. That's why it's so good, Microsoft had nothing to do with its design! Now let's hope they don't ruin it.This is a great product for storing, managing (annotating), and retrieving your images. Yes there is Aperture and Lightroom but I feel Iview is far easier and quicker to use. The above products offer too much, making them both quite slow and complicated compared to Iview. Once I have images ready (organized and annotated) I then open them in photoshop to adjust and convert them. It works just fine.2207 update: Well, now that Microsoft bought Iview the show is over. They no longer provide RAW updates. So, I've switched to Adobe Lightroom, which is actually much better anyway."

I'm not sure why all of the comments from IT professionals are so negative. Their comments almost made me seek another vendor but I decided to try to Norton Antivirus 2007 because I have many years worth of favorable experiences with Norton and I simply couldn't believe what I've read. As it turned out, I made wise decision. I'm completely satisfied with the program and I like the new screen structure (but it did take a bit to shift to the new way of doing things). I'm honestly confused why so many gurus have so many problems when a regular guy like me found everything to be painless."

When tax time came around, I used TurboTax & simply imported my donations from ItsDeductable. I found ItsDeductable easy to use and have used it for the 2001, 2002 & 2003 tax years.I've read some reviews where folks wanted to print out the ""market values"" so they can simply do an inventory of non-cash items then go back to the computer and input the information. Unfortunately, ItsDeductable won't allow you to do this. You are forced to make a hand written list. I've always had an issue with this.BE AWARE!, ItsDectible has had some significant problems since the 2003 year. This year (2004), I can no longer download updates from ItsDeductible.com.

91151,1,"I bought this game for a friend and had many chances to play with it before I wrote this review. The game is much more stable, the environment is more self-sufficent, and the norns are very intelligent. There are many more things to tweak and play with in the world, and the environment is bigger. The one problem is, after you set up the environment and connect technology, the world becomes self-sufficent, thus leaving you to sit there and watch until something major happens. Good for the average user, but if you enjoy building COBs, altering genomes (the world is, as I said, self-sufficent), et cetera, I would wait off."

28354,1,"I highly recommend this product for meal planning. I get recipes from my Cooking Light subscription and to avoid piling up the paper around the house, I enter in the recipes by copy/pasting (from the CL website) into this database, including the nutritional info. You do have to manually enter the ingredients, because it's in a database format.Here are some top reasons to buy:1: Save all your recipes in one place by customizing your own cook book and recipes in an additional ""book"" in the database.2: Once you enter the recipes, you only need to print the recipes you need and recycle that single sheet instead of working with a cumbersome huge cookbook and finding storage space.3: You can create a custom number of servings automatically with the software. For example, if the serving size is for 4 and you want 10, it will calculate the ingredient amounts.4: To organize your meals for the week, you can drag and drop your recipes into the planner and then it will create an aggregated shopping list with the amount of each ingredient. I select what I already have and then it only prints a customized shopping list for the week. You do need to spot check.5: The recipes that come in the software are good for getting started.6: When you make the recipe, it's easy to make your own notes and adjustments to keep for the future instead of writing all over your books.It's a great buy for a busy household."

I had used Seagate Backup for Win 98 (Backup Exec)for several years and found it to be an excellent program and was therefore interested in using the successor to that. It loaded without problem on my new Dell with Windows XP. It worked flawlessly from the start without any glitches and without having to contact customer support. It easily spanned 4 CD's to backup the entire drive and verified all of the backed up data. I tried restoring files and that worked fine as well. I highly recommend this program. It is probably reasonable to do the 30 day trial first as they do not have a money back guarantee.Addendum: I just had occasion to restore my computer completely from the four backup CD's made several months ago. It worked flawlessly. This is a fantastic program!!!"
8805,0,"Better than release 6, but still too frustrating for the common user to use. It would help if the interface were more intuitive, but it is Adobe and they still prefer to make it appear as a ported Mac product."
42358,1,"Terrific product. I purchased it for my 15 year old daughter for her high school projects. It's easy to use, especially for the computer illiterate like me. My daughter, who is very computer savvy, finds the software very user friendly. She put together a power point presentation in no time flat."
34435,0,"This is a really good software product that catches a very high proportion of spyware. I work in IT security and would have to say this is probably the best at this task. Why a stingy three stars? User interface isn't the easiest to work with (very minor complaint it's not too bad) and price.One of the previous reviewers mentioned his firewall wasn't stopping spyware - it isn't meant to. This package is just an element of security, it wont even catch all spyware (as a previous reviewer stated running more than 1 spyware detector helps - I would suggest running Spybot Search and Destroy and Ad-Aware SE. Spybot was written buy a German guy but supports many languages including English. Both are free - Spybot S&D; does solicit donnations (do consider).If you want to ensure good all round security (you will never get to 100%, if you do, you'll be rich!), don't get a false sense of security by runnning just one security program. Make sure you run:* Virus Software* Firewall Software* Anti Adware/Spyware softwareIf you have cable / DSL use a hardware router (you can have more than one PC online and improve security). If you use a wireless router, enable encryption and the other security settings (see my homepage for a more detailed discussion of wireless security): http://mysite.verizon.net/stuart.gardner/id21.htmlThis is a small element of security at a high price (when considering NORTON and McAfee provide a complete suite for $50 pa). In combination, Ad-aware and Spybot S&D; surpass this product - the same can be said for the Norton and McAfee spyware detectors."

94464,0,"Unexpectedly, my old NAV 2005 was cut short by 6 months before my subscription would expire. This may have been due to the fact that I had uninstalled my NAV program several times because of several unknown interferences. So what Symantec did was to shorten my subscription due to these uninstalling (what cheats these Symantec people are!!!). So I decided to try NIS 2005 which also blocked my anti-spyware and registry scanner. So I purchased NAV 2006, Trend Micro 2005 and 2006, and MCAfee 2005. I installed NAV 2006 which seemed to work okay, but would not allow my anti-spyware SpyBouncer work as a stand-alone anti-spyware program. In fact it identified Spybouncer as a virus, which I found difficult to believe since SpyBouncer has helped me in eliminating innumerable spyware since I began using it in July 2005. Also it would not allow my registry cleaner to work. So fearing threats of much spyware which Microsoft Internet messenger was alerting me to, plus being somwewhat slow, I uninstalled NAV 2006, tried Trend Micro 2006, but for some reason, it would not install. I wanted to try Trend Micro 2005, but with my experience with TM 2006, I decided not to try it. I wanted to use McAfee 2005, which I also purchased but decided against it. I decided to stick with NAV (better to deal with the devil you know than the devil you don't), so I re-ordered NAV 2005 and got a newer version of it via Ebay. Since installing it, everything is now working okay and normally. Moreover, like NAV 2003, NAV 2005 alerts you to viruses as well as attempted break-ins into one's internet system.Moreover, it gives the option of permitting or blocking Internet Messaging (which from my experience, may allow viruses to infilitrate one's Internet browser). So I was very much exhilarated at returning to the good old NAV 2005. Please do not get me wrong NAV 2006 appears to be a good program, only that it will not permit stand alone anti-spyware and registry cleaning systems to operate within its domain, which NAV 2005 permits well without a hitch. I hope Symantec updates 2005 as often as possible and patterns NAV 2007 (which may be coming out soon) on NAV 2005. As for me I am sticking with the good old NAV 2005 for an indefinite future."
28883,1,"A very easy to use tool for keeping your budget on track. the only improvement I would suggest is that it let you track your current expenditures alongside the budget, but that is just a minor nuisance. I would reccommend this to anyone who doesn't like complicated excel sheets and it is much easier to understand than those budgets that are included in Quicken and MS Money."
5108,1,"I have been using Norton 2004 for a few weeks now. I'm running a P4 with only 256RAM. Yet I've not seen one single problem with it that some people are mentioning. Plus I have 2 family members running it on slower machines w/o problems. I did see one person have major problems with their machine after installing Norton 2004, but the reason for it was because they had a worm on their system. Norton didn't create the problem, because they were already having trouble before that, it just found the problem (but couldn't correct it because the worm had been on for a long period of time). Try keeping your windows updates current, and you shouldn't have any trouble with Norton 2004."
78788,0,"As an avid fan of the show, I HAD to have this game, and now that I have it, I'm not sure what I think of it. It's kind of hard (I can only do two games on it), but, on the other hand, it's a lot of fun to see the charaters from my favorite show on here. (Especially Buzz and Delete- I really like them.) So, I think a die-hard fan should look into it, but be prepared: it's not as easy as it looks."
68636,1,"This game is excellent. It allows you to build rollercoasters exactly the way you picture them. And the game is so addicting, you will probably be on it all day. Take my advice and buy this game. It is without doubt the best PC game I have ever played."
5168,0,"This software is junk. Sure it will catch your viruses. So what? There are DOZENS of better programs out there that will do the same.Fortunately I did not have installation troubles...butNorton 2004 slowed down my pc like hell. It takes an extra 45 or so seconds to load at boot..and this is on a fairly current 1.8Ghz 512mb RAM P-4 machine.To give you an example of how much of a resource hog it is...if youre a gamer, play the game Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and watch in amazement as your FPS rises from 50 average to 76 average when you turn off the CCAPP.EXE file ( a norton 2004 file).Summary:Not worth your money. AVOID."
62078,2,"I purchased this software and it didnt work out of the box. told me to try a new version. 3 days of battling with them i finally tossed it in the garbage and wrote off the $50 because they were not going to make it easy to give me my money back. The program is full of bugs. I tried it on 3 different computers. same problem - didn't work. There arent any help menus, nor is the support any good. crooks selling crap!"
66056,1,"For years I've only been able to motivate myself to workout maybe once a month. I don't know enough about fitness and such to spend time in the gym and leave feeling like I really helped myself. This program is perfect for this problem. I started out with fifteen minute workouts once a night. It was easier than I thought. With Maya talking you through it, the fifteen minutes go by really fast, cause she keeps you moving through different exercizes. As time passes new moves come up which keeps things fresh and challenging. The best part os that through the whole thing Maya asks you how you're feeling and such, and adjusts things to your liking. I end every workout feeling great with that little bit of muscle burn that lets you know you've done your body good.I would recomend this to anyone who has trouble getting a workout going. Get it for PC, Xbox, Playstation, whatever, it's the best fifty bucks you'll spend. Heck, I'd even recomend just buying an Xbox and this game, and you'll still not reget spending the 200 dollars. it's like having a live in personal trainer for life, for 50 bucks! (but now it's even cheaper!)"
63483,2,"You get what you pay for. I have tried a couple of different of these type of ""intro"" products in hopes of learning enough German to make my way around while traveling in Germany and Austria; and I do not see where one is better than another. The Berlitz German Primer is just that, a primer. At best it gives you enough to ask some basic ""survival"" questions and (hopefully) recognize some basic things you may encounter, for example, while in a restaurant, at a train station, hotel, etc.. Again, my experience has shown me that all of these inexpensive programs will do the same thing. The biggest disappointment with this Berlitz product is the MP3 files that can be loaded onto a personal audio device. These are nothing but a series of words and a few very short catch phrases; pretty worthless. Don't think for one minute this program enables you to recognize much, if any, German spoken by native Germans because it will not. Again, its value is as a very basic entry level language primer and it does that as well as the other inexpensive products that are available."
42220,1,"I have been searching for a solution in project management for over four years. Being a manager for a corporation, I am bombarded by emails, phone calls, documents, conversations, meeting, and employee performance discussions. Although Microsoft Office suites offer good tools to deal with these events, I could not find a solution to tie everything together.I have relied on using task manager, handwritten journals and digital journals, and various project manager softwares, but none seemed to really solve my problem. I needed something to document in a journal like fashion of things that happen day-to-day but still tie in with Outlook calendar and tasks.Until last week, while searching I discovered OneNote. Downloaded their free trial from Microsoft Online. Took some getting used to as the options and sections were so flexible. After one day of use, I'm sold on it. I can't believe this product had a 2003 version and didn't know about it. What a shame! All that lost productivity and organization. Better late than never.If you need a way to organize your thoughts, events of the day, tasks to be completed in a single location but hyperlinks specific items to Outlook email, to do tasks, contacts, PDF/Word documents, and various projects, then this may be the answer."

5325,1,"In The LCC, Campbell brings a much-needed perspective back to the table for those homeschoolers interested in a classical education for their kids. He presents what the term ""classical education"" used to mean; how it differs from the ""neoclassical"" approach popularized by Susan Wise Bauer, Douglas Wilson, the Bluedorns, etc.; and how homeschooling families can put such an approach into practice. It's a slim volume, highly readable and very practical. For the historical and theoretical background, he draws heavily from Simmons' Climbing Parnassus (highly recommended reading). For the scope and sequence section, he draws heavily from Highlands Latin School/Memoria Press.The LCC is recommended for those interested in a more traditionally ""classical""--as opposed to a ""Great Books""--education. The emphasis, first and foremost, is on the classical languages, Latin and Greek. Campbell's mantra is that less is indeed more: Making these languages the central focus of study means that other ""elective"" courses of study--and even other really wonderful classics--should fall away or be reserved for independent reading. This is a freeing perspective for parents who look at the 20-30 great books their 7th grader is ""supposed"" to be reading and want to just throw up their hands.Another interesting difference is that Campbell takes a multi-thread approach to history as opposed to strictly chronological. I'll leave it to the book to explain more fully, but in a nutshell, he has students doing English Studies, Classical Studies, Christian Studies, and Modern Studies simultaneously (though on different days and possibly in different weeks). Very different from The Well-Trained Mind or Veritas Press chronological, cyclical approach."

73592,0,"Overall the Rosetta Stone language program is very good. Arguably it is the best that's out there. You can read the other reviews and get a feel for the features of the program; You can also visit their website.What you need to know:You will pay a lot of money for this program, this is what you get: 1) An install/application disc which is the base program. This disc is the same disc that will come in all the Rosetta Stone programs. They are interchangeable. 2) You will get one CD that holds all the data for Russian One and Two. 3) You will get two workbooks, one for level I and the second for level II. Basically these workborks are a verbatum index of what is presented on the software. I would be surprised if you use them, in fact you can get better workbooks from your local bookstore for less than $15. Summary: You are getting one CD of data and two cheap workbooks for $300. THAT IS IT!Finally, as the Fairfield lawyer explained to me, if you are not an authorized dealer, do not try to resell their software espicially on Ebay. If you don't like the software after you purchase the software, give it away or throw it away but don't sell it on Ebay. To do so would violate Fairfield's copyright. I learned the hard way when my Ebay item was removed.Recommendation: 1) Shop around 2) Request a free demo CD from their website, know exactly what you are buying 3) Shop around again"
76236,1,"After having unsatisfactory experiences with accountants, we decided to use this software. It was very user-friendly and goes through everything step by step for the federal return very well. It also fills out the state return for you but without showing you nearly the comprehensive steps that the federal return had. We had to check the state forms accordingly to make sure all was well. Overall, an excellent product that I will continue to use in the future."
13840,0,"I now actually have the 2005 iteration of this program, but it is essentially an updated version of this software. I am extremely torn on rating this product. On the positive side, the software makes unbelievably professional looking DVDs that can be played on a computer or conventional DVD player (at least in the US.) The end product is fantastic, and the quality of the image, sound, and menus are first rate.There are two negatives, though, that many others have noticed: the customer support (particularly the website) is absolutely worthless. You need to be a real self-sufficient person to use this software. Secondly, the interfaces are fairly complex and are frequently counterintuitive. A lot of learning occurs by trial and error.Overall, I do recommend the software because it is very capable and reasonably priced. Having said that, you may be content with Windows Movie Maker, which comes bundled with many PCs now, especially if you don't have the patience to learn this rather trying software.Still, though, in the end the DVDs look great!"
50925,1,I HAD THE OLD VERSION OF PHOTOSUITE III AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE NEW ONE. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO LOVE TO WORK WITH PHOTOS.
88549,1,"My kids had expressed an interest in learnig a foreign language and I was curious about the &quot;immersion method&quot; so I got this software. Each language has 2 CDs. &quot;Talk Now!&quot; deals with basic words, much like how we learned English in grade school. Spelling in English and chosen language is provided. The kids like the format because it is presented in a game show fashion. The other CD &quot;World Talk&quot; is more advanced, using conversational sentences which beginners would not understand if you haven't picked up some elementary words. It does give out clues but no translation in English. Pros: This program will teach you how to speak by repetition and visual recognition of objects and is excellent for beginners. You can also print out a picture dictionary and exercises and record your voice. Cons: No explanation of pronounciation, grammar, or spelling. Same words and graphics for all four languages. Overall, a great program with no glitches, entertaining, and excellent introduction to foreign language."
24312,1,"We play many adult and child board and online games and I am not aware of a game that is more mentally stimulating while being fun for a child. My daughter has been playing this since she turned 4 and continues to ask for this series two years later. I am not sure that one needs to have all of the games from the series, since many of the puzzles are based on the same type of logic, but I feel that every child should own a copy of one. Since the puzzles offer four levels of difficulty, most of them would be challenging for the average adult. The great replay value will help boost a child's analytical skills to a point that many of their school tasks become trivial."
33304,1,"I bought this program to record songs on my computer and to record more than one track to a song. when I first brought it home it was a little hard to use but after about two days it was so easy. I am able to make awesome songs and the sound quality coming from the instuments is good. It hardy ever screws up or breaks down, its reliable, its easy and its fun. For the price its the best MIDI program out there and you can always trust cakewalk, belive me even if you are just a beginner get this."

54826,1,"I bought this title because the first Typing Instructor For Kids got such good reviews. I was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding. He has always had a terrible time with handwriting. I knew I needed really easy, slow-paced typing instruction for him, or he wouldn't get it.Well, it's 6 months later and he can now type! We did it with nothing but this software. I made him practice about 10 min/day 5 - 7 days/week. All in all, he found it to be work to learn this new skill, but still rather enjoyable.There are 11 games included and several of them are very good -- meaning they are really fun AND build typing skills at the same time. There is also a series of drills, lessons, and typing tests to teach the keyboard. The keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time, and then you repeat the related drills, lessons, tests, and games until those keys are learned fairly well. I had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at 15 wpm before letting him go to the next section. This is what the software recommends, but I had to learn it the hard way. At first, I let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed. I ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to 15 wpm on each section.I would recommend this software for children from 6 to about 11. The cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that. However, for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons, this would be an excellent way to learn to type too. I found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software."

32210,1,"I Love Zone Alarm, for home systems. When I install an O.S., I immediately insatll Norton's Anti-virus &amp; Zone Alarm, before connecting the computer to the internet. Then, as each application asks permission to use the connection to the internet, I either Accept or Decline the request. For a couple of days, this can be a bit annoying, and frustrates people who want to quickly show you something on the internet--but, overall this is a good thing. If you take a few days to Install, Update and configure Zone Alarm, on a home system, you Rarely find any Spyware or Adware in the system (unless you click the wrong buttons or download things you chould't from the internet). I have been *very* pleased with Zone Alarm--even if it frustrates my friends.Personally, I would rather take a little extra time to Accept or Deny a program's access to the internet, than wasting all the time it takes to clean-up a system that is infested with Spyware, Adware, etc.Sometimes, I must spend over an hour removing Spyware, Adware and restarting virus protection, remotely, on corporate systems (that are running McAffee and a dummed-down firewall).One thing people need to realize is that A.V. protection is just ONE of the major requirements for running a Windows system. Currently, if you are not running A.V. protection, a Firewall (!!!), Microsoft Updates and &quot;Spybot Search &amp; Destroy&quot; (or a similar Spyware / Adware removal tool that is well-tested), your system is destined for Doom.A good combination, for great protection, is : &quot;Norton Antivirus 2004 Professional,&quot; by Symantec &amp; &quot;Zone Alarm.&quot; However, if you do not do the Microsoft Updates, your system will be toast, regardless, and you can plan on a lot of O.S. re-installations.I also recommend using a Router with a built-in firewall, in combination with Zone Alarm, but the average person needs at-least Zone Alarm.&quot;An ounce of Protection is worth a pound of Cure.&quot;"
32764,0,"I travel internationally and was looking for something that would give me an idea what cities I was over from the air, when riding on commercial transportation. This product does that well from the air, but as I read on several other reviews, on the ground, it can be another story. It can put you on the wrong side of a river or when riding on a train, the depicted track can be 3/4 mile away or more. I have the US Street map and that works fine and is very accurate, but the World database still needs some tweaking. I use it with the Etrex Vista."
23555,1,"I suspect the 2004 version of ""Cosmi DVD Ripper"" had the DVD-decoding software removed so you can no longer rip copyright-protected DVDs because of that Federal Court Ruling in February (Maybe the US Supreme Court should sort this whole DVD-burning/fair use/copyright-thing out).I purchased the original version of ""Cosmi DVD Ripper"" in the fall 2003 and it made decent back-up copies of my DVDs. However it is very slow and only copies about 100 minutes worth of movie material. But for $10, it does the job."
54773,0,"At seventy issues for ten bucks, this collection is definitely a steal. The comics are PDF files, which isn't a problem, but I have reservations about the files. One, these are scans of comic books, not reproductions from original computer art. Not only will you see old expired ads, but also staples and comic book folds. Two, you will want to read these on a large monitor. I couldn't read the font on my notebook screen, and could read it at 125% on my larger monitor. Three, the ""Marvel (TM)"" is on every page, though I didn't have any problems with this. Four, this is a PDF file, and you cannot export JPG files, a pity since these pages would make *great* wallpaper. But, again, for less than the price of a graphic novel reprint, you have six years of the Ultimate XMen, starting from the first issue to today. With these caveats, recommended."
76798,1,Just returned from a two week driving trip thru northern Italy and used my Garmin NUVI 350 with the SM card for Italy - I would have been extremely frustrated if I did not have this navigational device with me every time we entered one of the major cities...It took us to each hotel (or other attraction we were trying to locate) even when we missed turns etc...I would highly recommend this to anyone unfamiliar with driving in Italy - it's worth the $99 and more..

VFP 9.0 is an outstanding desktop database, and also plays well with server database systems such as SQL Server, as well as Web applications.I've used it for very large databases. Hundreds of thousands and even millions of records are no problem. The development environment is excellent. Object oriented development takes some learning, but the effort is rewarded by greatly improved ongoing application maintenance.It's too bad that the VFP and the xbase era is now over. I still use VFP for personal applications but no longer for paying clients."

Somehow the disk became broken, I mean really broken with a chunk taken out, no one will confess to breaking it.I reordered a program as I found I couldn't do without it. It's simple and easy to use. The book that comes with it lets you browse through the clip art quickly and find what you need. This clip are will work with most any program I have. It's simple little clip art but that's what I need 99% of the time and there's lots of it. I highly recommend it."
25846,1,"I upgraded from NIS 2001 on Win2k. I had no problems installing and configuring this software. It has performed flawlessly. NIS 2003 is a great upgrade from NIS 2001. There are many nice features including the ad-blocker. The interface is cleaner, more logical. Commands have been added to the context-menu (right-click system tray icon). I can now go directly to live-update from this menu. NIS also dials directly instead of painting the connection dialog box and making me press &quot;connect&quot;. I can also go to the options dialog or view statistics or logs from this menu. NIS integrated seamlessly with the other accounts I created in Win2K and set up their controls automatically.Before you install this software, go to the Symantec site and obtain instructions for un-installing existing Norton products. Find and print the instructions and follow them. Read your manual. There are instructions for manually cleaning things up as well. Certain situations call for the executable that Symantec supplies to help uninstall. Educate yourself and experience a flawless install like I did. It's not hard.I disagree that Norton products have been backsliding. I have not had a problem with this product and there were good, solid improvements on the NIS 2001 iteration."

Recovered files that I thought were gone, there is other good software, and I recommend those as well, but Data Rescue does just what its name says. Recovers your data from a damaged drive. The tech support is fantastic, rapid response and a full and complete answer to my issue. I don't think it could happen quicker. The biggest compliment that I can give is that I'd certainly buy again.I think we'd all had software issues, problems with something or other and it takes weeks to get a solution, if you get a response at all. Mine was quick, courteous, helpful and solved the problem, is there better?I'm not sure where the other reviewer had his/her problem with support, but perhaps that was an isolated incident or in the past. The company is responsive beyond my expectations, which are always high."
46002,1,"I find Star Office 6.0 to be exactly what we need. I am responsible for all purchasing of hard and software for a small business named Gean Overseas, Inc. Recently, we were faced with the decision to upgrade our Office suite. All of the machines in the office were over 5 years old, and many were starting to fail. As such, we were also faced with OS upgrades. Knowing that I do not have time to retrain the office to a new OS and that certain applications like Quickbooks are not available for alternative OSes, we had to stick with MS Windows. Since our office suites relied on OEM hardware manufacturer bundles, we were faced with expensive licensing fees to achieve the same level of productivity. We did not go with prebuilt machines this time because of maintenance concerns (we were tired of having to fix broken and malfunctioning prebuilt units). StarOffice6 really saved our bacon. It offeres all of the office functionality we really need at less than a third of the cost of similar office suites. For all machines that did not need access to our databasese, we even went with OpenOffice.org. Sun Microsystems is now one of my favourite companies. They saved us more than a thousand US dollars. That may not seem like very much to someone in a large corporation, but to us it is a significant one time savings that seems to predict a much less expensive upgrade path for our future."

53550,0,"One thing I can say about this software, having involved in the deaf community, it's more accurate than other software that I have used. Unfortunately the software is extremely buggy with sporadic crashes and unfortunate problems with logic. The search tool seems to have been written by an beginning programmer. Some signs are visually incorrect from their description (check out kitchen and notice the video shows him using the &quot;K&quot; sign, but the description says to use the flat hand. Some signs don't even match the video so use with caution. The links to the website don't work (they are old) and the support is non-existent. I suspect that ASL needs to really take off before people take the language software seriously. Also note that ASL has its own structure. You would never say I am going to buy a blue car. You would say something to the effect of &quot;Car blue me buy&quot;. Use it as a reference but not as a teaching tool to learn ASL. That is best reserved for the classroom."

7376,1,"I don't know what the original reviewer ""Don Elton Fish"" was looking at, but the import from QuickBooks worked flawlessly for me. Not only the master records, but also the detailed transactions going back 3 years.One major reason I switched from Quickbooks is because their payroll is expensive and support is AWFUL. Microsoft uses ADP as their payroll partner which is much less expensive for the same features and has reasonable support."
36484,1,"I wanted to write this review because I think people need more information on a product before deciding to make a purchase. I bought it because I read a review on resume books and software and I decided this was the best one out of all of them. This was based on the fact that it includes 250 career-specific sample designs for resume layout, 12,000 prewritten phrases, 3,600 action word thesaurus, 10 elegant professional fonts, AND MOST OF ALL, 500 practical questions that you are likely to encounter in real face-to-face interviews."
64731,1,"Spy Fox is very funny, entertaining, and great for everyone. The game is not long, and while the ending is always the same, there are many different ways to get to that ending. Replay value is great, and we are always finding something new the next time we play it. Overall, the game is great and I would recommend for anyone, even though the age ""limit"" is 6-9."
42050,1,"Microsoft Word 2003 is a great word processing program, but I would strongly recommend the Student and Teacher edition. The Student and Teacher edition contains Word along with Exel, Powerpoint, and Outlook for about $120 AND you can install it on up to three separate computers."
17079,1,"I purchased this program about three months ago because my children had expressed an interest in learning how to play chess. Since then my two older children (9 and 7) have completed the program from start to finish. (Although I already knew how to play chess, I also played the game from beginning to end as I do with all software that enters our home.)The program introduces chess in a stepwise fashion within the framework of a story involving protagonists (Fritz, Chesster, and Bianca) and their rival the King Black. At each stage, learning is reinforced with a series of rewards and intermediate goals. These rewards keep children enthusiastic and motivated through what can be a very lengthy learning process.The game starts by using a series of games to introduce the movement of the pieces. The heart of the game, however, is a series of training activities that reinforce different tactics and ideas in chess. The activities are challenging for beginners without being frustratingly difficult. My children were, for the most part, able to use the program independently, although in one or two places I had to sit and coach my 7-year-old. The 9-year-old completed the entire program in about 2 days, and my younger child took about a week. Even when completed, the program is not useless. The game serves as a chess program with levels of play ranging from very easy, to extremely hard. At the highest level, I suspect Chesster would beat the pants off even some of the most experienced players. If your child has more than a rudimentary understanding of chess, however, you probably would be best purchasing the second in this series instead.Referring to previous reviews, I am uncertain why other users found the program confusing and difficult to use. Yes, it is true that there is no manual included with the program, but I did not need one. I found the program to be intuitive, and even my three-year-old can load and play the program without assistance.As mentioned in other reviews, the graphics ARE simple. But, my children found the story engaging, and were amused by the characters. I found the interface to be clean, attractive, and appropriate for the purpose. The animation is storybook in style, and is simple enough so that the program is not a CPU-eating monster like some other graphics-heavy versions of chess.A few users mentioned that they disliked the chess pieces being represented as cartoon characters. I believe they are unaware that you can toggle between ""regular"" pieces and the character pieces at any point during the game. My son prefers to use the game with the standard pieces, and my daughter likes the cartoons. This has not stopped either of them from understanding what the ""regular"" pieces look like.There are a few drawbacks. The game starts by introducing the movement of the pieces with a series of strange arcade games. My children didn't really seem to connect these games to the movement of the pieces. (What does smashing toilets have to do with moving a bishop anyway??) I also found some of the dialog between the characters to be bordering on offensive, and some of the jokes to be inappropriate for the age level (for example, referring to a group of Queens as a harem). Bianca asks far too many idiotic questions, and giggles way too much for my taste. She also says things like ""This is so overwhelimg"" in a tone of voice that reminds me of the brainless barbie dolls of years past. (Although some may not see this as sexist, I wonder why the male character doesn't do much giggling??) Still, these are minor annoyances.Overall, I think this is a superb way to introduce children to the game of chess. Both my older children learned in a week or less, and are anxious to learn more. What else could you ask for in an educational program?"
15640,1,"I've used Nero since Version 5. So upon installation on my Vista Home Premium system, the interface was familiar and easy to navigate. All the functions I want to use are there and seem to be working just fine.I've read complaints here and elsewhere that Nero 7 takes over your system. It's important to be careful about which components you install (you can always add a component later). Also, and this is critical, they give you the option as to which files you want Nero to open by default. I simply deselected all of them. If I want Nero to, say, open a jpg file, I'll use the ""Open with"" command. I also did not install any program icons on my desktop. And to avoid installation problems, be sure to turn off any antivirus software and any other programs you have running (like it says in the manual). If you have earlier versions of Nero installed, be sure to remove them first before you do anything else. I did all of that and it was a very straightforward and easy installation. The only really annoying thing was, at the very outset of the installation, they give you the option to install ""Just Ask"". It's easy to miss, and I don't want it. So be sure to look for that and deselect it if you don't want it."
76563,1,"Good product; however, I don't understand why it requires lengthy updatesevery time I open the program.Perhaps they should try to get it right the first time.

You can also design and print your own envelopes,address labels,iron ons,calendars, and small crafts for kids.

79348,1,"This is my first astrology software so I don't have anything to compare it with. With that said, this software is reasonably priced and offers what I think is a comprehensive intro to astrology. I am thoroughly enjoying it and after only a few months of play, I am learning quite a bit! The software does not offer readouts of interpretations and instead allows for a point and click feature which delineates the meanings for you of planetary aspects as well as planets in houses. I think if it offered an interpretative readout I might get lazy and forgo the process of leaning how to interpret on my own. I find it exhilarating when I can interpret an aspect in someone's chart that is spot on accurate to their personality and it brings me back to my big wonderment, ""What is it about the nature of the universe that this stuff works?""I feel myself coming to the point of wanting an upgrade so that I can begin to learn about transits, their meanings and how their energies may manifest; timely as Saturn begins its transit of my natal Pluto (wish me luck!)."

46856,0,"I have been looking for a straightforward, functional, and basic illustrator program for my Mac (I used PaintShopPro when I was on a pc). I need something more zoomy than a drawing program, but not as elaborate or expensive as Adobe. I had purchased the Printfolio suite based on the advertised claim that I would be able to design logos. I did not realize that this meant I would be limited to merely building logos from the packaged images and shapes.I contacted their Tech Support asking if it was possible to draw a curved line or create a Bezier curve in any of their applications. I received a swift and polite reply that no freehand drawing is available in any of their applications. (A strong plus for their responsiveness, but not much help for my purposes.)I am not planning on returning the package, since this will still serve me well for desktop publishing. However, it does not deliver the creative flexibility that it advertises, even with the Art Text plug in. According to their web site, ""If you're creating a website for a business or your personal needs, Art Text has all of the tools you need."" Unless you want to use one of their library images, no, it doesn't. Not at all."
50100,1,"First off, I want to say that I've used mostly Windows Operating Systems until I got introduced to Linux Kubuntu which then got me into OS X. There are things I love and hate about all three, so I hope you find my review unbiased.THINGS I LOVE ABOUT OS X:It sounds cliche, but probably the first thing you'll say when you see OS X is: ""Wow! What a beautiful desktop!""The Dock is really colorful and large--great for us that are stimulated visually. It's also really intuitive as far as adding and removing icons go.Printing is a breeze! I plugged in the USB cable from the printer and I was instantly able to print. No software required or install screens!The Dashboard feature is really nice for checking out weather, date, time and a few calculations.The Expose feature is really handy if your desktop is cluttered with lots of windows.The Startup and Shutdown times are superb: ~1 minute Startup and ~15 second Shutdown! Even better than my Linux Kubuntu desktop!Very intuitive overall, once you play around with it for about a month.It's very stable (not prone to crashing, etc.)NITPICKINGS:Virtual Desktops are a must, hence OS X's Spaces, but I was disappointed that there was no wrap-around feature like you find on most Linux distribution desktops. Thankfully a little free program called Wrap fixed this.The default application software is not bad, but I've seen better (Amarok, K3B, etc.)No fan control options, but this can be fixed by installing smcFanControl.In general I found that most programs did not have any as many options as I would have liked.THINGS I HATE ABOUT OS X: Honestly, I can't think of anything I HATE about OS X, but if I wanted to play a video game I'd definitely switch to Windows and if I wanted to customize things like crazy to my personal taste I'd go with Linux Kubuntu with E17 added on.OVERALL: Probably the best OS I've used, right alongside E17 (Enlightenment). Windows definitely has some catching up to do . . . ."

These are simple tasks using Paint Shop Pro. When I tried to register my copy of Photodeluxe I was told that the registration number was already in use, and that I would need to fax Adobe with proof of purchase. At that point I gave up.I think that the produce just about deserves three stars for manipulation of images, but the print problem and poor help prevents it achieving more."

69408,2,"Suitable product, but by the time you add the cost of their software, (necessary to print checks) your time to set it up, more time to run a print job of checks, and the excessive cost of their paper, you could purchase pre-printed checks from any of hundreds of companies that sell them for less. And all without the hassle of setting up and using the least user friendly and unnecessarily complex software I have used in many years. This paper ought to cost about 1/2 of the price it is being sold for. If I had not already invested in their dreadful software, I would not be using this. I regret having bought into this check printing system, and would not recommend it to others. Save your time and save your money. Find yourself a check printing company on the web, and avoid the aggravation of dealing with poorly designed software and overpriced supplies."

58281,1,"my sister and i bought this game in a skeptival mood. Well we were wrong. We played this game together, laughing, talking, working for 2 days only pausing for like 8 hours of sleep. The clues that where in every spot were hard to see and at the smae time obvoius. In short you had to think. The game is 3-d interactive so you can revolve in a circle, talk to people, even use a pay phone to call for clues, pizza, jakes locker and also one more funny hint-you have a phone card with a number call that number. the thing that happins is the funniest thing in the computer game world. this game is so big it has two disks. oh yeah, another cool perk is when you talk to people you have choices of 4 or 5 things to say and whatever you say has a reverse effect. you can even die! But it is not bloody so little kids can play it (although it is way hard). In the end this was a fun, cool, game that brought my sister and i closer together and i WILL get the next one.)"
15633,1,"I originally bought a CD-DVD-RW drive that shipped with the O.E.M version of Nero 7. Every so often it would ""freeze-up"" and I would have to reboot the computer.

What I really liked about this edition is it comes with about 20 programs and you have the option to install which ones you feel you may need."
87832,2,"It appears to be a relatively standard foreign language program. Difficult to naviagate and requires many tries to become oriented. Spanish-English Dictionary requires a code number for installation, and no matter how many combinations of serial number, proof of purchase, etc., you may try none will work. Have to email maker for solution which interrupts any learning routine. It would seem resonable to offer an easy reference to whatever code is required for installation in an obvious place on the box.Program appears to be very comprehensive. I would prefer more CD-ROM's and fewer Audio CD's. The combination of four of each type disk makes for a confused schedule for learning."

6408,1,"Though The Kids Are All Right never surpasses the threshold of greatness, the film is an intelligent take on familial and romantic relationships.While Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) struggle with their marriage, their daughter Joni (Mia Wasikowska) faces graduation. Meanwhile, their son Laser (Josh Hutcherson) contacts his biological father, the free spirited Paul (Mark Ruffalo) who donated sperm when he was a young man. As Paul is increasingly intertwined in his ""children's"" lives, his role in the family becomes more complex.There are no villains here. Nic's controlling nature is somewhat overemphasized, but Bening remains sympathetic and humorous. Moore is likewise engaging as the appealing but insecure Jules. Ruffalo is excellent as the laid back Paul. His unexpected reactions to having a family of sorts are fascinating but a tad underdeveloped.Joni and Laser are perhaps the most well drawn characters. In fact, their stories could have been explored more. The siblings have a close but imperfect connection. They are sarcastic, naive, endearing, and a refreshing departure from unrealistic teenage stereotypes.The Kids Are All Right touches on everyday questions of patience, disappointment, and love. The movie sometimes strains to find the right amount of quirk, but it's a rare film that is both enjoyable and smart, and thus worth seeing."
32018,1,"I bought this product because it has the best value: a lower cost compared to its competitors, and ability on calibrate monitors and printers.Setup is easy, takes about 10 mins, and gives multiple options for standards to calibrate against, such as sRGB.

No spectrophotometer unit to verify color absorption."
39359,1,"If you're on a Mac, you've probably used at least one of these programs by now. If not, you're missing out on what Steve Jobs calls &quot;The hub of your digital lifestyle.&quot;iMovie - For the amatuer film maker, or somebody who just wants to edit their own home movies, this is a cakewalk. Once you connect your camera through a Firewire port, you import your video. Add titles. Add fades, transitions, etc... Add some background music. Then, download it back to your camera (or, with a bridge, to a VCR). Better yet, save it out and import the video to iDVD for burning.iDVD - I can't begin to tell you how easy this is. Create a menu (or select one of the many theme menus). Import your video. Click burn to DVD. It is literally that easy. I made a DVD of our improv troupe for all the members' Christmas gifts.iTunes - If it's a music file... mp3, aiff, wav... it can import to iTunes. Create a music CD. Burn it as a standard or mp3 CD with a single click.iPhoto - You can set this up to open and import the images as soon as your camera mounts to the desktop. Organize the images. Edit them for color or size. Then, burn a CD, make a slideshow, or even order a personalized bound book with your images and text.The one major flaw of these programs has been the lack of manuals (except through third parties). A small price to pay for this kind of quality. Also, if you have no need for iDVD, the other three are available for download from the Apple web site."

You just open the DJT program, choose a sound file from your hard drive, trim it to the section you want, and upload it to the DJT website. You may then either send it to your phone from DJT or download it to your computer. Once on your computer, you may transfer it to your phone by bluetooth or USB cable. If you want to convert a song from an audio CD, you will need a CD ripper. My entire CD collection is now available for free ringtones. Amazing."
2164,0,"Two weeks ago, I carefully installed Windows ME on my computer, replacing the preinstalled Windows 98. That was a mistake. While ME has some nice features and improvements over 98, it left my system more unstable and buggy than it had ever been before. For the record, my computer easily met the system requirements for ME. Anyway, after the upgrade, I found IE 5.5 to be slower than IE 5.01, Media Player 7 was a piece of garbage, my McAfee VirusScan loaded much slower, there were video driver glitches, etc...I had similar hassles years ago when I upgraded another computer from Windows 95 to 98.After the experiences I have had, I do NOT believe in upgrading your PC's operating system. If your machine came preinstalled with Windows 95, 98, or ME, then leave it alone. Putting in a new OS totally upsets the equation and causes innumerable problems. Many of these problems don't develop right away. Also, upgrading your OS often violates your manufacturers warranty. So if you need tech help, often the maker of your PC will say...&quot;sorry, but we can offer no support since you changed the operating system. Call Microsoft&quot;. So a few days ago, I got fed up with the glitches and completely erased my hard drive, and put back in Windows 98. My computer works better than ever.My PC has a small sticker on the front that I should have paid better attention to: Designed for Microsoft Windows 98/NT. Didn't say anything about ME. If a new OS is released and you simply must have it, wait a few months until patches and bug fixes are released, then buy a new computer that has the new OS preinstalled."

At the end of tests, you do not have the correct answer displayed, all you have is the percentage of the correct answers. Also, you can not save your answers, so if you need to do it again, you have to do all the questions all over again.Then we tried the English test, the program crashed and my son wasted all the time.

20434,0,"I may not be the typical user Pinnacle had in mind. I don't have a DV camcorder: my video comes from an analog video capture card. As such, the input files to Studio are MPEG1. My goal is to edit them and output either directly to VCD or another MPEG1 file.In comparison to other products in the price range that I've tried (Ulead VisualStudio, MediaStudio Director, Extreme Media Digital Studio), Studio 8 is easier to use and offers features such as frame-level editing, scene detection and multiple clips per input file that the others don't. (The others might say they have frame-level editing and scene detection, but either don't have the controls for it -- a slider is not appropriate for frame control, and neither is hoping you hit pause at just the right time -- or only perform the function for certain inputs, such as DV.)I can't compare the rendering speed with the other products mentioned above, but it seemes comparable to the TMPGEnc encoder.The version off the CD in the box would split the input MPEG file into scenes admirably, but the thumbnails for each clip were all messed up -- a correct thumbnail for one clip would also be assigned to the next dozen or so clips as well, and attempting to set your own thumbnails had no effect. Then when rendering MPEG output (VCD or file), the sound would drop out after half a minute or so and never come back. Installing the current released version from Pinnacle's website (8.3.18) fixed the thumbnail problem, but the audio problem remained. I then installed a beta version (8.5.8), and it fixed the audio problem, but the thumbnail problem was back and much of the output video was just a green screen. The way I've come up with to get correct MPEG output is to edit and render the video in 8.3.18, re-render in 8.5.8, and use TMPGEnc to multiplex the video from one file and the audio from the second into a third. The procedure works, but it is time consuming and requires two separate installations (most likely meaning two computers).Pinnacle could also do seemingly little things to speed up Studio's editing. For instance, one unique feature is the ability to have multiple clips in a single source file -- the details being stored in scene (.scn) files. But apparently the thumbnails for each clip are not stored in the scene file meaning that the whole input file needs to be read when opening it in order to find the thumbnails.If Pinnacle would fix the bugs and make some seemingly minor changes to speed the editing process, Studio would definitely rate five stars. As it is, at least for editing and rendering MPEG output, it's the best editor I've found for [the price], but it leaves a lot to be desired."

58350,0,This is an OK product but be careful. If you think you are buying a reading game or a read and answer learning tool- this is not it. This is merely a video lecture with some humor thrown in. It is not at all interactive.
66778,0,"When in Story Mode the game is seriously lacking directions, and prompts. For instance, after watching the video describe the big storm in the introduction, the screen jumps to Gordon's Hill. There's a sign that says Knapford, and another sign with a picture of a shed. There's no verbal prompts, or instruction, only a butterfly flitting in the air. After a minute, the narrator says, ""Let's check Wellsworth Station for something to heat up my steam."" There's no sign for Wellsworth Station, so you click on the sign that says Knapford. Thomas says, ""I'm still feeling a bit cold,"" but the train doesn't move. Then, you click on the other sign. It says, Jeb Coal's Workshed, and when you get to the Workshed, Thomas indicates that it's empty, and that perhaps we should come back later. Then, you notice a sign that says Wellsworth. You can either go back to Gordon's Hill and watch the butterfly, or click on the sign that says Wellsworth. Obviously, you click on the sign, and once you arrive at the station, there's a bucket of coal waiting. Click on the coal, and Thomas thanks you. Then, you're transferred back to the contents page. Sir Topham Hatt offers an ""attaboy,"" and instructs you to click on the next chapter to continue the adventure.You could literally go back and forth from Gordon's Hill, to the Workshed, and back to Wellsworth Station without really knowing what you're supposed to do. There is no map to direct you, or verbal prompts. The video mentions that Thomas is cold, and needs to warm his steambox, but it doesn't specifically tell you to find a bucket of coal. The entire game plays in this manner, in Story Mode anyway. It's like a wild goose chase with a lot of guessing about where you're supposed to go, and what you're supposed to do. The cursor highlights the signs, and announces what the signs say, but the Story Mode frustrates little one's, because the objectives aren't clear.Thankfully, the instructions are thorough in Activities Mode. The narration is encouraging, and offers assistance when in trouble. When changing the difficulty setting, or when leaving the game, the narrator always prompt with, ""Are you sure you want to leave the game?"" This question comes with a thumbs up for yes, and a thumbs down for no. Kids understand this, so I like this aspect of play. When I first played Thomas Saves the Day, I was confused. Now, I'm not into computer games, so that's not saying a lot; however, in my view a preschool game should be crystal clear. This computer game is rated EC (Early Childhood), and is intended for the very young, 3 to 5-years. Most 3-year old children are not reading yet, so they need simple verbal prompts to assist them. Despite the aggravation with the Story Mode, William enjoyed the Activities Mode. Some of the games are more challenging than others, but for a 2-year old it was enough to keep him busy for 30-minutes or more. As he became more confident, he attempted the chapters. Now that he's 4, he flies through the program.I'm torn as to how to rate this game. The graphics and sounds are exceptional = 5. The narrative instruction is great in Activities Mode = 5, but ridiculously weak in Story Mode = 1. The game entertains my son = 3, but lacks educational value = 3. I'd like to give Thomas Saves the Day an above average rating, because once my son got the hang of the game, he was quite amused by it, but the lack of direction in an early childhood game bothers me. Had Atari designed the game with two levels of play in Story Mode, one with instruction, and one without, I probably would have rated this game excellent. Bottom line, an experience preschooler will probably like the challenge of the Story Mode, a beginner will be seriously frustrated."
62694,1,"this product is GREAT! ... it does what it promises it will and it is very easy to use. It's a simple process that takes about two to three minutes to create a ringtone from ANY music you have access to. I use MP3's and I LOVE being able to create custom ringtones for all my friends and family .. that way, I know who is calling as soon as the phone rings ... no need to look at the phone. This can be very helpful if you are driving.The process is a simple 4 steps ... 1. select a song, 2. grab the part (20-30 seconds usually) that you want for your custom ring tone, 3. send the link (thru their website) to your phone and 4. answer the message and download the ringtone to your phone.I have many custom ringtones I created that really suit my style ... by AC/DC, the Stones, Buddy Guy, stevie Ray Vaughn and Led Zep. The best/easiest to hear have to have a little bite to them (ballads generally do not make good ringtones).My favorite ringtones are AC/DC tones including Highway to Hell and Back in Black. You can use your own favorite music and create as many ringtones as you wish ... at no additional cost.Oops ... I hear Highway to Hell right now ... must be my work calling."
27324,1,"My 7-year old autistic daughter loves this, and all the other Pajama Sam games we have. I only have to help her a little bit here and there to get her going, and then she will spend hours or days with this game.In this one in particular (all 3 Pajama Sam games are great), a good feature is that you have to read the phone number, in the control room, in order to use the phone to make an appointment, to see ""Mr. Somebody"". And the phone number changes, each time you start up the program, so you can't just use the same one over and over again."
722,1,This is one of the few anti virus that actually seems to work. Used McCaffee and Norton Internet Security and took them off my systems. This one functions without a hitch and seems to catch everything.
1735,1,"First off, this is a good prduct and works though I had to use the cable to get the GPS to work, just plugging into the USB did not work inside 2 different cars. The problem I have with this program is that they have not done what is totally obvious in my mind: User puts in home address and when searching by just street name, the street name in the town that person is in is first, then that streets within that state, etc. As it is now, you put a street name in and you get that street in Arizona even though I have never made a search in Arizona. I use the program to invest in real estate so I put in a lot of destinations in a confined geographical area. When the program doesn't ""learn"" that I am aways searching the Toledo, Ohio area and use that as a proximity sort on searches and the program does not give the option of having a ""home"" to use as a reference, the function of the product is unnecessarily frustrating."
4098,1,"I loved 10.1 due to the superior interface and stability of the unix-based platform, but there were a number of annoyances. These have almost UNIFORMLY been fixed in Jaguar (10.2) and I cannot recommend it highly enough. I'm running it at home on a high-end (if 2 year old) machine - dual processor G4 machine with Radeon graphics card and on a 6-month after debut iMac (from way back), so i feel i have a good experience of using it. First the best news:* Neither machine has crashed since I installed 10.2. And the iMac was real flakey with 10.1.whatever -- it now is solid* It's faster to startup, initialise OS9 and just plain do stuff. Especially noticeable on the iMac.* My QPS!Fire CD-R/W drive can now burn from iTunes and desktop. In 10.1 it could only do it through Toast* All my other stuff (IR mouse, ancient serial line X-10 control system ""MouseHouse"", KeySpan USB-serial interface, palm interface) works just fine.* USB Printer sharing!!! Phew. Now I can share my canon printer and not have to export stuff around the house and run from room to room.Other nice news:* Smooth and clean fonts* Sherlock yellow pages and other modules is awesome* Hog heaven for unix hackers like me!Overall, for me, the big wins were supporting way more peripherals natively than it used to, speed improvements and stability. As an example, I used to reboot in a ""nothing can interrupt"" configuration to burn CDs -- no network or anything. Now I browse the web and download software while burning at 32x. Last night the (Microsoft) web browser crashed whle I was burning a CD and I had to kill the browser -- BUT THE CD KEPT BEING BURNT THROUGHOUT. Mega-nice.I usually like to write balanced reviews, but from my perspectives, there were NO drawbacks to upgrading to 10.2 except $$$. I see that others have had problems with peripherals and print drivers -- my experiecne has been exactly the opposite. Everything from ancient RS232 serial ports running through a Keyspan serial to USB converter has continued to work, and stuff which previously didn't, now does."
75107,1,"I upgraded from Photoshop 7. So far so good, I like the new changes. Right now I am learning more about the Bridge and the Raw Camera. This program makes me want to shoot in RAW.Photoshop just continues to prove that it is the best photo editing program in the world."
11559,1,"I think I have every software title for babies & toddlers out there! This one is my 2nd favorite (right after Baby Wow). It is very interactive and has different levels for babies/ toddlers, and pre-schoolers. Babies/toddlers can simply bang on the keys to make things happen, while pre-schoolers can interact more sophisticatedly through the mouse. Good graphics & sounds and many of the games have several different versions."

72063,1,"Ventura has always offered more features per dollar than its rival desktop publishing programs (some experts who use them all estimate it would cost $10,000 in add-ins for Quark Express to have all the features included with Ventura). I've tried some of the others, but none really can match the ease of use and power of Ventura 8, and now Ventura 10. Ventura is simply the best for publishing books, newsletters, magazines, brochures, flyers, and catalogs.New to Version 10 is a great ""Publish to PDF"" feature that turns your Ventura documents into letter perfect PDF files with a few clicks of the mouse. Ventura's modeless cursor really speeds up production as does its built-in Database Publisher which enabled us to produce over 300 fully formated pages of our book ""International Job Finder"" in an afternoon -- including two extensive indexes! The Navigator makes it easy to change the order of chapters in a document and easily track down index entries, markers, and cross references.I won't pretend Ventura 10 is perfect -- it was designed to run only in Windows XP and 2000. But it is very stable; bugs are no worse than what its competition offer. Since I started using version 8 several years ago, I have not had to call Tech Support even once. There's an incredible newgroup of Ventura users (at cnews.corel.ca, under corel.graphic_apps) around the world who can quickly -- and accurately -- answer any question you proffer."
17178,1,"It takes forever to get this to work. I couldn't get XP Pro to run at all, but regular XP worked eventually. After that, there's the song and dance about registering the Windows software with Microsoft, which took about 5 tries, but eventually did work. (I was using the software that came with my Dell; I have no explanation for why I had to keep entering the same data over and over before finally I got a product code that Microsoft's robot would accept.) After that, I run only the simplest of programs-some high school educational stuff-but it works fine (if you don't mind wading through a couple of error messages on startup that say everything isn't fine but don't worry about it). Bottom line: it's probably better to buy a cheap PC if you really need a PC, but if your need is occasional, and you love installing software, this is fine. NOTE: I have Tiger but haven't upgraded Virtual PC (there's an online upgrade at microsoft) since what I have runs fine."
56280,1,"WOW! Like Adobe Photoshop but for only under $30. You have to get this for webdesign and photo editing. Too bad it doesn't include the Animation Shop like it used to when Jasc owned it. Corell owns the program now, expect better company help I guess. I have made awsome graphics for my website."
19392,1,"There is so much that can be said for Microsoft's new Visual Studio .NET programming platform that I will only mention some of the key points here...For existing OO developers (Java, C++, etc.): You'll now enjoy a single programming interface (Integrated Development Evironment - IDE) for multi language solution development. The IDE is very intuitive and has plenty of help built in in the form of auto statement completion, integrated dynamic help and intellisense to guide you.For existing VB developers: You no longer have to feel like a second class programmer. VB.NET is now FULLY OBJECT ORIENTED and supports inhertance, overloading and polymorphism in just the same way the long-time OO languages have.No matter what language you develop in, you'll have one IDE and a VAST set of built-in classes to work with.The other major point to mention about .NET is that with it, you are positioned to rapidly create powerful web applications as never before through ASP.NET and Web Forms.Data in VS.NET is converted to XML automatically. This means that .NET is a powerful tool for managing the movement of data as well.Applications built with VS.NET are not COM dependant (although they can interop with COM for backwards compatibilty) which means the end of &quot;DLL Hell&quot; for thousands of developers around the world.The bottom line:There is an awful big learning curve here, but the rewards are well worth it (language integration, common IDE, rapid application development, ease of application deployment, new power behind web applications, etc.). There are surely features that need to be improved or introduced, but VS.NET is a great first step into the next era of application development (eventually leading to platform independance).You and your organization may not make the move to .NET right away, as it does involve a learning investment, but learn .NET now anyway because it WILL be the programming standard."

54777,0,"First and foremost, this is labeled as a ""Complete Comic Book Collection"". It's not. Ultimate X-Men ran 100 issues and ended in 2010. This was made in 2006 when only 69 issues were available and the arc was ongoing. The first Annual is included in here, but not the others.That said, it's really a cool thing to have. The scans are excellent quality, with the left and right pages visible on each scan. It's perfect for the two-page spreads and the unconventional panel layout. I've got no complaints about scrolling through it. I love the feel of the original books, but I didn't mind reading it digitally.The original ads are preserved, right as they were in the original comics. It's kind of a neat little trip through memory lane, but I can see how people don't like that. There are a few points where the issue that was scanned had some printing errors, but that'd happen if you were collecting the originals. For the most part, the comics scanned were in great shape and the resolution allows you to really zoom in.Bottom line is it's a cheap way to start reading Ultimte X-Men, but if you want the whole series, plan on supplementing with the trade paperback collections."
54669,1,"This program is not meant to compete with professional-level programs like Adobe Photoshop. Instead, it is more on the level with PhotoImpact, PaintShop Pro, and Photoshop Elements.In my mind, the strength of this product is it's ease of use. It has several ""fix picture"" functions which work wonders. These functions (which adjust Contrast, Light levels (for tweaking shadows and highlights), and Tint (a.k.a. White Balance)) are great for digital camara users. You can correct a whole batch of photos at once, and the results generally come out pretty good.The feature of this product not present in the cheaper versions is the ability to ""add"" flash and reduce backlighting. No, the program cannot save you if the exposure was so far off that the information is simply not there, but it can correct the majority of bad lighting situations.One of the drawbacks of using a digital camara vs. a point-and-shoot film camara is that with the film camara, the photo lab will take care of adjusting the white balance and tweaking the exposure on your prints without any input from you. This program gives you that capability for your digital prints.Of course, it has the obligatory red-eye fixer, pointless effects, clip art, project templates, etc. Ignore all that.One nice bonus is it includes a real paper manual, not some short installation brocure.The user interface of this package is very friendly (much better than Photoshop Elements, PaintShop Pro, or PhotoSuite). Most of the functions are self-explanatory, and don't involve you having to have any idea what is going on behind the scenes."
89364,1,Excellent--my children love this game. It makes them feel like they are actually working the rigs. It is amazing to watch even the youngest one find his way around the game.
91464,1,"I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like. However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted. This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years. Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.If you're interested in the X-Men, whether from the new movies or just from being a kid at heart -- for 40 bucks you can know it all. (almost)."
56732,1,"As a long time AppleWorks user, it's great to see that Apple finally got around to writing a *modern* word processor in Pages. AppleWorks had grown quite long in the tooth and the user experience was basically unchanged from Mac OS 9. Not a big fan of Word (too slow, UI inconsistent with the rest of OS X), I had grown used to using the bundled TextEdit program which comes with every Mac. TextEdit takes advantage of OS X system wide features like as you type spell checking, speech, floating font and color palettes, etc.. However, TextEdit can't do advanced things like multi columns, wrapping text around pictures, etc.. So the choices on the OS X platform were rather meager - slow an inconsistent Word, underpowered TextEdit, or old and clunky AppleWorks (aside from a few other third party tools which aren't very widely used).Pages is basically TextEdit on steroids - all of the major features 95% of people expect a word processor to have are present and much easier (and faster) to use than in Word. The regular OS X features such as customizable toolbar, floating font and color palettes, as you type spell checking, etc. are all present. Moving graphics around is quick and seamless even on a slightly older Mac (667MHz G4). Also, the import and export options seem to work very well from my limited testing - most importantly, it imports and exports from Word without any problems that I can see.Sure, there are some things which Word can do that Pages can't, but most of them are not things I'll ever use any way. I'd much rather have an easy to use and efficient word processor than have to deal with Word.Keynote 2 (the other half of iWork) is also a great program. I can't really compare it to PowerPoint since I haven't used Powerpoint much, but I have to say that it was incredibly easy to learn how to use. The master styles are very handy for applying consistent features across your presentation, and the transitions and animation effects are nifty looking as well as easy to create. The import and export from Keynote to Powerpoint also seems to work seamlessly. It also allows you to export as QuickTime, Flash, PDF, etc..All in all, highly recommended - especially for the very reasonable price."
8200,1,I've used Adobe Photoshop since day one and have tried and worked with all the versions that ever came out.... I can honestly say that they really outdid themselves this time. The new features make the program even more user-friendly than it already was and the interface is also very appealing. I'd recommend it to anyone who is serious about computer design. I know I am! Kudos Adobe!
18798,1,"This new version of Quicken Deluxe, is an improvement over the 2000 version. If you are using 2001, I would recommend that you keep that version.

26051,1,"I've looked at a bunch of the services out there (frontpage, bbedit, etc), and Homestead is by far the best option available.

Within a few hours, you can have your site up and running.The best part of Homestead is that they include the hosting, domain name and e-mail addresses all in one package for a very reasonable price."
87537,0,"I have been using Peachtree for many years and have always installed each update very efficiently. This time I purchased the Multi-user. It was impossible to install - mainly because the Peachtree support team was very ineffectual. They were absolutely no help whatsoever. Totally disappointed in this after purchase help. I had to call in an IT specialist. The first one couldn't install it and he tried to use the Peachtree support team - again they were no help. I called in a second IT specialist and he was able to get it installed without Peachtree support in about 2 hours. The total installation hourly commitment was 5 hours plus my 2 hours of trying plus 2 more hours. The cost to install came to over $400. The product itself I like so far - have only been using it for 2 days, but Peachtree needs to have better support techs."

31080,1,"I write this review sitting in the study of a house that I designed entirely myself using the broderbund software. It took me two years, but I was able to make floorplans that a local builder was able to work from and get permits from. My house is exactly as planned and the 3-D model generated by the software is a spitting image of the house. When I show it to people and tell them that it was all done before the house was built they don't believe me.I get the impression from the reviews that people think being an architect is something one can learn in an afternoon from a book. Not so. If you really want to design something that will be built, the amount of time you will spend mastering this software is nothing compared to the time it will take you to understand how all of the various local and national building code rules are going to force you to do this or that with your plan.I am not an architect, but I was able to use this software to enable me to have a house built exactly to my specifications. If you aren't willing to invest a lot of time in it, you should hire a professional."

13445,2,"I bought this game because the reviews said the puzzles were as interesting and intellectually challenging as the 7th Guest; but it is far less so. Too many of its puzzles require guess-work and don't require logical analysis. Also there are too many ""jump-though-hoops"" steps, i.e. completely random use of an object, not based on any clue or information from any of the characters. In fact, to get the 5th level, I had to go to a hint guide to find that I had to go back through all four previous levels and click on one completely random place in each level. Yeah I want to waste my time, but I'd at least like to use my brain while doing it."

It was a lot of fun for us and we learned a lot, even though I didn't intend to at that time!I've been noticing complaints about the game's character Polly. I hope customers realize that Polly is the antagonist in the game and Botley is the protagonist that encourages you and helps you throughout the game. Even though Polly is mean to the player (very rarely!), she is a really fun character and my sister and I enjoyed her character. She was quirky for a 3rd grader!This game is great for any young child because it exposes them to:math (multiplication, addition, subtraction, fractions using a cooking robot!)history (they go into the past a lot and talk about what polly changed)art (the art room really exposed me a lot to the art world. that's where i learned about georgia o'keefe!)biology (the biome maze was hard for us but i learned what a savanna was)creativity (come on, a time travel machine?!)This game has so much potential to really get your kids' brains kicking. I'm going to let my little cousin play this!The only problem was that I found it really repetitive. You had to get back ~50 robots from the past so that was quite tedious. But by the time your kid finishes this game, they'd be out of 3rd grade!This is a great educational game. Actually, it's just a great game. Great graphics, sounds, games... Full package!"
31451,1,Why buy Microsoft software when they first come out new? If you can wait a couple of years until the price comes down you can get it at a steal. Microsoft sells their products at prices that the average consumer can't afford but when it's old and somewhat outdated the price is very affordable and it works just as good as the new software. I would suggest everyone who would like to own a Microsoft office suite to buy it old or used because that's where the real deals are.Bobby Wiggins
32633,1,"If you have't the time or the money when trying your expermintations on 3D applications, then this product is for you. I've used Strata for a couple years now, and it has taught me some very simple but effective 3D modelling and animation knowledge. Comming from a Computer Science background I was always fascinated in Computer graphics, and Strata was my first product. With it you get a very indepth set of manuals which take you step by step in modelling examples as well as animation examples. Not just take but version 2.5.3 is a real stunner. It comes with (plugins + reference manual) that really make a difference when created CG.It has some limitations, and it requires quite a lot of memory on Macintosh systems (only used on Macintosh 9600/350), but for an entry 3D application, it is very easy to learn, and you will be creating CG in no time.Conclusion: Though not the best in the 3D application software area, it does produce stunning CG/animation - (used in creating certain scenes for Hercules), it is very easy to learn and through that learning you may extend your 3D knowledge in other 3D software.4 stars."

73263,0,"For the type of webpages I build, the ability to handle dynamic content is a *given*. A good web page creation tool isn't just a glorified text editor with shortcuts.First, a few good points about GoLive. It's got great directory managing abilities. It comes with quite a bit of jscript and other scripting 'objects'. It's well integrated with photoshop, with the ability to make live previews, etc.However, it's worst problem is that if you want to use newer web technologies, such as PHP, CSS, and other dynamic content, it isn't any better than a text editor like vi or notepad. As a comparison to Dreamweaver, it just doesn't cut the salt. It won't preview external stylesheets. It won't parse the php on your page to show you what your project would look like upon completion. It can't even handle server side includes.Granted, Dreamweaver isn't perfect in it's parsing of such things, but GoLive is an order of magnitude worse."

63705,1,"Original Review written March 20, 2001:I've been in the business a long time. I remember a day when everyone was claiming &quot;Finally Real Time Video Editing!&quot; At that time I was working with an Amiga Video Toaster Flyer. About three years ago I switched completely over to PC editing. At first the road was rocky. If you've never edited on a Toaster Flyer, you really don't know what real time is! Three years ago I couldn't find a single product on the market under $5,000 that could truly compare to the speed I was used to.You see, with the Flyer you would slap down some video, place an effect in between and voila! Instant playback--hundreds and hundreds of effects!I didn't really know what rendering was until I came over to the PC platform. Finally, just over a year ago, I discovered EditDV 2.0 (Now CineStream--which, can I just say, the new name stinks!).Edit DV comes the closest to real-time that I've ever seen. It has an amazing amount of filters and controls (ie. Color Correction, Film, etc.) and plenty of effects (more can be added with Pixelan Software). I create video only for hobby, work projects and the occassional contract job, now days, but even as a professional videographer, I would not be without at least one workstation set up for Edit DV.Cuts only editing is Completely REAL REAL REAL TIME! Add a few transitions and you'll be rendering for a few short seconds. Create some complex filters and you'd better go to lunch--but isn't that the way PC editing is?The thing I like most about EditDV is it's easy capture window. Most programs prompt you for a name after each captured clip completes. Edit DV can be set up to Automatically name your clips so you can keep capturing as fast as you can click &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot;, &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Stop&quot;...Edit DV takes advantage of your Dual Processor, so you get work done twice as fast! Not many programs in this low price break offered that a year ago. I'm not sure many do even today.Edit DV runs LOTS faster; processes and thinks much faster than Adobe Premiere 5.x. Again, I've only tested on my one machine (which is dual PentiumIII/500MHz with 512Mg RAM). Adobe is VERY slow compared to EditDV (on my system).Edit DV 2.0 has everything and more than Adobe Premiere 5.1 has--except one. If you do Wedding videos, or special occassion photo montages, listen up! I found myself turning to Premiere, even as slow as it was, to do photo montages. Premiere imports your photos at whatever resolution you scanned them. This lets you zoom and pan across your images like the pros. Edit DV 2.0 converts all imported photos to 640x480. If you zoom you'll see serious image loss.HAPPY DAY, THOUGH!!! Edit DV 3.0 (CineStream 1.0) allows you to do the same &quot;large photo importing&quot; as Premiere, so I can finally toss out Premiere altogether!Only, who will join me in my crusade to change the new name, CineStream, back to EditDV 3.0? Anyone... Anyone...?PS - Both Adobe Premiere 6.0 and EditDV 3.0 (CineStream) are OHCI compliant. I have not tested Premiere 6.0. But you should be able to catch my EditDV 3.0 review right here on Amazon, in a few weeks.You simply won't find a better package (hardware and software) for the price!"
52955,1,"A little too much of Vanna, which slows the game some what, but still fun."
35062,0,"In theory and ideal this an incredibly wonderful package with great expectations.Since personally I have not created anything better,yet,it is difficult to ridicule,but I must say the bugs should have been minimized before the next version was released which no doubt is plagued with the aforesaid problems.The copy I received was not full functioning as they set claims for it to be and appeared less than a demo version which was available for free.Many of its claimed functions did not,i.e. realistic hair design and motion,animated movement(walk path acted like fly by,but was interesting,thought provoking),charactar foldrs wouldnot open and import from Shader was null and character creation was non existant.It has a face morph which does layer faces onto some heads,feature morh works limitedly(aging,facial nuiscances) but would not export to working scene image and were stuck in creation room.Customer service was great need,I did admittedly pester them daily with reports of bugs and failures with detailed actions as atempts of work arounds.Import export features too limited for productivity or usage.Concidering I had purchsed a several hundred meg GPU card for such works with multipipe lines this was very perpplexing tool(or toy) to deal with,animation was never simple for quality in film or video,"

Being a beginner blues guitarist I have used plenty of DVD's and books to teach me the foundations (scales, chords, turnarounds, etc...). This program allows you to learn note for note the specific songs included on the CDrom. I love the virtual fretboard as it goes right along with the highlighted tablature!This product gives some artist backgrounds and some interesting tips that will help you actually understand where the solo's come from, which I think is a great help for the beginner guitarist.I love the fact that you can slow the music down as well as loop whaterever section(s) you chose.Overall, for the novice that's trying to learn some fantastic songs this is definitely an awesome tool to learn with. Totally worth the money!"
85871,1,"PC-DOS 2000 is a minor upgrade to PC-DOS 7.0, the version that came out as Windows 95 was released. This version is Y2K compliant and supports the new Euro currency symbol. It comes with many features not associated with DOS such as pen support and PCMCIA support. It also comes with a GUI backup program, Stacker 4.0, IBM antivirus, REXX programming and a plethora of utilities. Runs on anything from an 8088 upwards. I use it on my laptop with Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Even though it's a 486 I find it faster than the Pentium laptops my friends have that are running Win9x or WinME. I credit the speed in part to PC-DOS 2000. After 17 years of tweaks and improvements to DOS, PC-DOS 2000 is honed for speed and minimal memory usage. And it's just about perfect."

53327,1,"A vital tool for those who are not advanced audio engineers but just want to be able to record, edit and customize their audio files."
63032,1,"I already own 10.3 (and 10.2, and 10.1 and 9.0 before that) which have all lived on my G4 at one time or other. I was a little concerned about blowing another load of money on what is a point upgrade after all. But the hype got to me so I coughed up and thought I'd relate my experiences.First off, OS X comes on a DVD which is a Good Thing (tm). I'm sick of the ever increasing number of CDs that modern apps & games throw at you. Everyone has a DVD player these days (or can buy them for a paltry sum), so it's about time. After booting from the DVD I was able to upgrade smoothly with one problem. The problem was that I had to install X11 manually.For all the touted changes between 10.3 and 10.4, most of them are cosmetic, minor or unnoticeable to the user. The exceptions are things like Dashboard (small applets) and Spotlight (file search).To be honest Dashboard is just a bunch of eye candy applets that live on their own screen and ignore all usability guidelines or any familiarity with existing OS X behaviour. Some applets such as the weather applet have infuriating behaviour, such as ignoring the enter key when you type the location you want weather for. Why they exist on their own screen is bizarre too. It would have been much better if spotlight apps co-existed with normal apps and behaved like glorified post-it notes that you could float or hide as you saw fit. As it is you must toggle their screen on or off, which makes them a huge pain to use in conjunction with normal apps.Spotlight is genuinely useful, and finally adds a decent file search tool to OS X. There is also a new video chat app, and some changes to Safari like RSS reading. Another addition called Automator supposedly allows you to construct batch jobs easily but I didn't see any reason that should want to do that with what comes with the OS, and any 3rd party app would have to be upgraded to support it. Developers get a new XCode 2.0 and gcc 4.0. I was disappointed that the Java is still 1.4, since 1.5 is much faster (on other platforms anyway).Finder has also changed cosmetically so that your ""shelf"" of favourite places appears on the left hand side. I hate the new brushed chrome look and the general waste of space for each window, but it seems more efficient than in 10.3. Some peculiarites from earlier releases still exist. For example, if you drag multiple folders to your dock, they all look identical. I wish that Apple would let you colour a folder and not just the label, or stick a little badge on a folder (like in Gnome) to personalize it.So nothing in 10.4 is really that earth shattering.I think you would see some performance improvements if you have new kit like a G5 since 64-bit support is practically non-existent in past releases. There are supposed to be quite a few new libraries that makes use of G5 acceleration. But I don't notice any difference in speed between 10.3 and 10.4 on my machine.Therefore I'd say you should skip this release if you're a G4 owner with 10.3 who can resist the hype. That's not to say that 10.4 (or 10.3) is not a great OS. Far from it. OS X is a superb OS, but what you get for upgrading from the last release isn't worth the upgrade fee. Anyone still on 10.2 or below should go for it though."
40455,1,"I think that this book was great for introducing Nora Roberts' fans to J.D. Robb. I only recently started reading Roberts but I've read all of her newer romance/mistery books and really liked them. I was a little wary of trying Robb and &quot;Remember When&quot; was a great crash course into the series. The problem with introducing non-Robb fans to the series this way is that they loose so much of the history of the characters and are a little lost at first with the unfamiliar slang for things that we don't have yet. The second half was so good though, and so different from the normal Roberts stuff that it made me want to read the series, which I immediately did. I definately thought that the Robb part was better than the Roberts part. That is probably because I'd burned myself out on Roberts and the plot was a little simple, but I think that was because both stories were shorter than her normal lengths and there wasn't enough area to develop the best plots. I really love Roberts, but I love Robb more and if you have read this book and didn't like Eve or didn't like the characters it is probably because you haven't read more of the series and haven't had time to fall in love with her enough. Eve is a great character, but if you come into the middle of the series, you loose how much heart she has (and she has a lot of heart).Read Robb's other books before you give up on it all together."

65475,2,"If you can avoid it, do not buy this product (or apparently any other Roxio Creator after version 7.5). ""Bloatware"" is a kind description of this software suite. Just because a program has many great sounding features does not mean that they will all function properly, or that any of the features will work for longer than 6 months. In retrospect, similar to most Roxio Creator programs, this software never worked at 100% capacity. Roxio also apparently does not design their software for longevity (and by this I mean working for a year or more). Easy Media Creator 9, as well as the newer Creators 2009 and 2010, do not continue to work properly as your computer system changes with necessary updates or patches (e.g. to Windows, java, Internet Explorer, Windows Media player, etc.) or with the installation of other programs on your computer (e.g. virus protection, firewall, etc.). Roxio may actually work right when you install it, but then it slowly stops functiong over time.I bought this software in 2007 to replace Easy Media Creator 7.5, and I then had to re-install about every 4-6 months due to various errors and components hanging up and crashing my entire system. Note that I have had the exact same problems with EMC-9 on my three different personal computers in the last two years; all three computers have different configurations and system parameters. Until recently, these re-installs seemed to fix the problems temporarily. However, beginning in 2009, the program became useless. I mainly used this software to edit personal photos and short video clips from my Canon Digital Elph. I was lucky to be able to create and burn two DVD projects without too much trouble, and was then never able to create a dvd again. At times the software would let me create an entire dvd project, but then would not burn the disc. Ever.In 2009, I began to get Runtime Error!s and -pure virtual call R6025 errors when trying to add media in VideoWave and also when trying to save a picture in PhotoSuite. After each error appeared, Roxio would then close and was therefore rendered permanently useless. I then followed all of the Roxio technical support listed suggestions and even Roxio forum advice for solving these problems (revert to Internet Explorer 7, disable DirectX acceleration in Windows Media Player, use registry fix, enable all Roxio components in msconfig...and on and on..). All Roxio's tech support suggestions then end with the same thing: Do a complete uninstall (takes about 30 minutes) and Reinstall the entire program (takes another 30+ minutes). They even suggest that you create another user account on your computer and reinstall Roxio just on this user account (note that you then cannot use Roxio if logged into the main user account on your computer). I was willing to do all this to save a program that I paid a good bit for; however nothing has worked. Roxio's email technical support has yet to even respond to my requests for help. Their ""premium"" but also useless phone technical support costs $1.98 per minute, and yes, they do still keep you on hold. They also give the same suggestions listed on the website for free, even if you tell them what you have already tried. You are then charged for this advice and told to just buy the newest version of Roxio.I have been using different versions of Roxio for many years now and have found no other software that claims to offer the same suite of functions in one package. Unfortunately, instead of providing software patches and updates to make Roxio software function longer, in the name of profits-Roxio sees fit to only sell you a new version of their software (about $100 each new version). In order to encourage you to forget about your now non-functional older version of Roxio (and they all eventually become non-functional), they entice you with new features...that don't work well to begin with and then stop working after initial errors. It seems that Roxio just adds additional features to each version of its software without making sure to fix the bugs in the last version. It also seems that no Roxio programs are able to work once something changes in your system (e.g. Windows security updates, Internet Explorer updates, newer service pack etc). So, either you update nothing in your system and continue to use Roxio or make necessary updates to protect your system; pick one. If Roxio would fix the bugs from the last versions and then offer some sort of update or patches that actually work, we might be able to continue to use their software. At this point, they have only offered an update for the newer versions (e.g. Creator 2010). However many have reported that this update does not solve any problems with this newest software; big surprise.Finally, know that your computer system should really exceed listed system requirements to properly run all of Roxio's components. If you have just what is required, some components might work, but good luck trying to burn a video that you created onto a dvd. It's not going to happen without errors or it will take all day to burn. Even with the newest, most powerful system, still expect problems when importing from VHS to digital (including the program saying you don't have enough memory when you do and the audio track not matching the video even on the highest quality). Having since examined many reviews found on pc-type online magazines and tech sites, I now realize that they used Easy Media Creator 9 (and the newer versions 2009 and 2010) on extremely fast machines maxed out on memory with gamer quality video cards. Most consumers do not run such systems. I can't really suggest anything else to buy at this time, but as a longtime Roxio user, my advice would actually be to avoid Roxio."

18523,0,"ACDSee photo management absolutely beats most (if not all?) of the photo management utilities typically shipped with digital cameras, hands down. However, free applications such as irfanview are really beginning to come together where this program is falling apart--namely ease of use and functionality.ACDSee has become a feature monster. The program does a tremendous amount of background processing and is constantly cataloguing and indexing your images. This is a problem if you work with a large number of new images on a regular basis. There is no obvious way to stop the database from cataloguing everything it encounters, and as time goes on this too easily corrupted database brings the program to its knees. The number of system errors and program crashes I've encountered with version 9 is absolutely pathetic for such an established name in this business. Multimedia is not handled well, best advice if you have an assortment of media types is to turn video previews OFF and just leave multimedia functionality alone.PDF ""photo albums"", highly configurable contact sheets, exportable file indexes and lists, descript.ion generation, HTML photo albums, simple slide shows, these are all great features I love to use with ACDSee. They don't seem to hinder normal operations of the browser so no harm done. The ease of using the conversion tools and lossless JPEG operations, as well as the excellent EXIF tools and batch renaming by EXIF data also just can't be beat. The interface is very flexible and anything can go just about anywhere, or go away, also a huge plus. The program has definite qualities.ACDSee needs to scale down the browsing app a LOT and get back to basics. I don't need a complex database when I'm rotating and deleting a thousand images I won't likely need again and using the browser to examinine EXIF data. I resent the fact that the search feature has become so highly dependent on building this consumer-oriented proprietary database (how many stars did you give your image and was it a pretty picture of puppies or babies or gramma's birthday?) it is barely functional for raw file searches. I have learned not to trust centralized absolute-file-location-dependent databases, particularly when tied to specific applications. I prefer organizing by files and folders and maintaining flexibility, and this program no longer caters to my methods. Unfortunately basic file management (cut/copy/paste) through ACDSee is extremely slow with a large database, but use any other app to move or rename a file and your database info relative to those images is orphaned and lost.(Nitpicking: The font viewer needs work, it would be very useful if it could be configured to display characters other than ""FONT"". Unfortunately de-selecting the font extensions did not restore the original associations to Windows Font Viewer so I had to do that manually. I'd also really like it if ACDSee didn't keep reminding me of other ""great ACDSee products"", I've clicked most of the ""do not show this again"" boxes but still see things from time to time.)For basic image browsing and pre-photoshop operations such as organization, elimination, and lossless exif rotation I have almost fully converted to irfanview. Because of the instability as your database grows, the constant indexing and cataloguing (think infinitely spinning hourglasses and delayed blank file listings when you'd rather just be viewing images) add all the junk features pros don't need and can't remove--and this has become a potentially annoying application."

47789,1,"This is a must-have program is you scan documents or receive faxes on your PC. It takes optical scanning recognition (OCR) to a level I never thought possible, and is a quantum leap from the OCR software that comes bundled with most scanners. ScanSoft, the manufacturer, claims a 40% improvement and from my experience I will not dispute this.What I love, though is the fact that it handles columns and tables by doing a near-perfect conversion. It will also save your scanned files as HTML, which is a real plus if you have a web site and want to quickly add pages without creating them from scratch.Adding to the power is the ability to import Adobe PDF files and convert them into Word documents, as well as to export your scanned documents as PDF files. This feature is convenient, but does not fully replace Adobe Acrobat 5.0, which does a lot more (see the Amazon product page for a fuller description of this software).Other strengths is the &quot;despeckle&quot; module that will read scanned documents that have smears and other imperfections that will confuse other OCR programs.I am using this software on a Windows 98 Second Edition system with a Canon CanoScan N650U USB scanner (the scanner is available from Amazon), and have been nothing but pleased with it. If you handle documents, especially faxes or paper, this will be one of your most essential tools."
72065,1,"We waited a long time for Corel to produce VPXML and when the did they called it Corel Ventura 10. A bit unadventurous ? In more ways than one.First major change is that Ventura will now run only on Win2K or XP (and presumably the successors). Corel reason that instability was on of VP's bubears and have addressed this by running only on stable platforms. It seems to wrk. it has not crashed on me in 2 months.The second big change is the ability to import XML. Lets make that clear. This is not an XML editor. It will import, format and paginate xml files. But they cannot be edited in situ. They are linked back to the original xml file which can be edited and VP will display any changes to the source xml.The XML facilities have been bolted on to VP. A new utility called the Mapping Editor allows users to map xml structures to VP tags including paragraphs, inline formats, page styles, tables, frames, rows and cells. Ther map is stored as an xml file with a .vmf (Ventura Map Format ?) extension.When an xml file is imported, a vmf file must be allocated to the import so that VP knows how to format the xml. A VMF can have an XSLT transformation attached to it so that the original xml can be restructured BEFORE VP sees it, again without affecting the source XML.If this sounds complicated, well XML can be complicated. And to use the XML facilites to their best you need to understand XML itself.The third major change is the addition of table tags. Know a standard table style can be allocated a name and reused accross a publication.This is a very good start and for me the use of xml is key.It works. But it needs a few more facilities to be top notch.Score 4/5"

I wanted something that was more convenient than bootcamp and parallels was recommended by a friend over VMware fusion. First only main issue I had was there is a bug in the software that caused after a few successful startups a strange hal.dll error pretty much frying my bootcamp install. I just got the updated software and reinstalled windows in bootcamp. Since then no problem. There help site wasn't a ton of help though. Also, I originally only had 1 gig of ram, parallels and windows more specifically likes more ram, so I upgraded to 2 gig, much much smoother now."

86889,1,"I bought Print Shop because I wanted to make labels-book plates for our personal home library. It does that and so much more. So far I've made the book labels, plus adorable return address labels for me and my new husband, a couple of cards, and soon I'll be making business cards and letterhead for my new home business. I purchased it at an office supply store for a little less, but either way, it was definately a worthwhile purchase. I'll find lots of uses for it. There is even the option of designing from scratch or using quick-start templates for creativity-challenged days. There's more clip art than you can shake a stick at, and enough fonts to cause a mountain of indecision over which one to use. I remember when Print Shop was just a dinky little dot-matrix banner and four-fold card generator on two disks for the Apple IIe. It's definately come a long way."

I recently upgraded to a new computer that has xp, and i thought i would try roxio ez cd creator 5 platinum, nothing but problems. So i went back to using nero. What i love best about nero, is that it isn't confusing at all. You don't have to read through tons of manuals to work it. All you so is drag and drop, then press that little burn button. If your stuck between nero burning rom 5.5 and ez cd creator 5, and are an xp user, go with nero."
140,1,"EZ Antivirus DOES scan incoming and outgoing email (contrary to what the other reviewer might believe). This program may not include a firewall, but the firewall built into Windows XP SP2 is acceptable and the free edition of Zone Alarm is a good alternative as well.The best aspect of EZ AntiVirus 2005 is that there is NO drag on system performance. Trend Micro, Norton, and McAfee ALL take a 6% hit on system performance, and all those other antivirus programs cause crashes, hangs, and blue screens under Windows XP (see cnet.com if you don't believe me).The interface on EZ Antivirus is much better on the newer version 7, so be sure to grab the latest version on their web site. Trust me - you'll never go back to Norton again!"
20347,1,"MindManager is one of the most useful software tools that I have. I use it constantly. It is very intuitive to use. It has a property that I really love about some software; if I'm not sure how to do a certain thing, I do what seems like it should work and most of the time it does. It's very friendly and obvious despite its sophistication. It's the kind of software that you can open up and just get to work with easily, but it also has a lot of depth and functionality to explore. I've been using MindManager for about seven years, including the various flavors of Microsoft Office integration and I have always been pleased with every new version of the software. You can output maps to many formats for sharing, collaborate on mind maps, and there's a really beautiful presentation mode that animates map navigation in an intelligent way for reviewing the information with others. The new version 7 has many improvements and enhancements over version 6, which I also loved. The implementation of the Microsoft Office styled ribbon tool bar is really well done, and the enhancements to mind map navigation and viewing are very helpful. I can very highly recommend this tool to anyone that needs to organize their thinking and planning."

1301,2,"I'm an expert user of version 2003. Our work computers are now v2007. So far, there are at least 4 things that I used to use/do on a daily basis that are not available in 2007 (e.g., no drawing or tables tool bars) making my job infinitely more difficult and slower. I learn quickly, but this program is not intuitive when changing from 2003. For example, why would ""page break"" be on one ribbon and all the rest (e.g., the variety of section breaks) somewhere else. The whole list of choices is there somewhere (I found it once), but finding it takes way too much time. When I am in a time crunch (typically) I take my work home to use my 2003. Why isn't there at least an option for the old style menu so those of us who used to be experts could get up to speed more easily. I've been using 2007 for about 6 weeks now and have been acutely wary of the change over phenomenon that creates resistence to using something new. I've really tried. I've used several kinds of external programs designed to help find things (including the 2007 help menu). This helps occassionally, but I often get the answer that this function is no longer available in the 2007 version. I'm thinking I need to bring my own computer to work to get something done. Avoid 2007 if you can."
3527,0,the install took forever they dropped napster but still have the lame O drag n drop disc utility which is junk. So i decided to skip that on install. The GUI is a bit more complex and it appears they want to steer away from novice users.The interface is complex and kinda hard to navigate. The first issue I came across is finalizing a disc (data) or any other for that fact. Kinda hard to set. even has a FINALIZING TOOL??in the project menu??i dont get it??so you have to check then recheck to finalize any burn????ok.whatever.I backed up a movie as well NO COMPRESSION but chopped off menus etc. it took a bit of a long time in comaprison to Nero 6.6 Recode. I also have tried Nero 7 and it is horrible buggy mess.and im not too pleased with Roxio 8 either but to be fair i need to mess with it a little more however its ok i still prefer Nero 6.6 which i think is thier best release to date

15543,1,"Among all of the terminal emulation programs I've tried this one renders remote sessions the best. Every one of the supported terminal types (Wyse, DEC, IBM 3151 and others) is transparent. I love the ability to use a web browser to view the sessions, and am especially impressed that this program not only supports Internet Explorer, but Netscape. This is much more than a terminal emulation program, however, because it also supports NFS, file and printer sharing and drag and drop copying. Another outstanding feature is the built-in scripting language, which is easy to learn and use.Overall, if you need a terminal emulator that will provide the most accurate emulation this one should be at the top of your list. If you also need NFS support and print and file sharing services this is the only one that fits the requirements from what I've used and evaluated. I'm pleased with it and highly recommend it."

The ending of the game, where Minette fainted after trying to fight with Nancy, THAT was a pretty good part of the game. However, I wish that we could've played the part where Nancy takes the dress to the police and tells the police all about Minette's dealings with those two German men, one is named Gunther and I can't remember what the others' name was. Nancy was also supposed to call Lynn Manrique and tell her that she found the stained glass stuff that Noisette had hidden. When Nancy talked to Lynn Manrique the second time, she told Lynn that she would call her again if she found the stuff that Noisette hid. We never actually get to play that part of the game either. I wish it didn't end before we were able to play it THAT way. It made the game seem like it was unfinished and put together too quickly."

2000,0,"Actually, I've tried and tested all the three Microsoft OS. Windows 95 OSR2, Windows 98SE and Windows ME. For a start, the former of the two requires less from your PC. Secondly, Windows 98SE is the most stable operating system, for now, provide you know how to maintain your PC. This is because, I've upgraded to ME from 98SE and found out that this OS is more resource-hungry than it's predecessor. Having to take so much of your memory and CPU power(of course, provide your PC have the muscle to do all the heavy work throw at you by ME). And when it comes to playing video files, such as VCD, the picture will always be stretched unnaturally. And this problem is only applicable when you are playing a PAL VideoCD. But, if you play an NTSC VideoCD, that shouldn't be a problem. And lastly, it occupies my space on my HDD. To me, Windows ME is not a suitable upgrade if a.)you are prepared to drain your computer's muscle b.)if your PC is capable of doing such heavy work.On a final note, certain programmes that are found in ME, are borrowed from Windows 2000 Professional. And having said that and after using it, I find that even Windows 2000 fares better than ME, in overall performance.So, people, if you have 98SE, stick with. They are still your &quot;best friend&quot;."
14822,2,"Getting this program 'registered' was easy. Just go to the Toontrack website, create an account, and take it from there. That was the EASY part.I have a Sweetwater Creation Station (Windows PC), about 4 years old, running XP. My recording device is Pro Tools 003 Rack.After 24 hours of trying to get this to work... I gave up. I trashed the program. It's like I threw $70 out the window (what I paid for it).I installed from the disk. Got several errors that I didn't understand, but you could 'ignore' them. Understand... the errors were there from the disc... nothing wrong with my computer. Got everything loaded in... tried SOLO, and this worked. Went into PRO TOOLS and was finally able to get the program to recognize the plug in. You have to create a STEREO INSTRUMENT track to be able to find EZ DRUMMER... not that it said anything about this in any of the literature. At this point, you have to 'click and drag' the midi files from EZ DRUMMER to the PRO TOOLS INSTRUMENT TRACK, and you could start building up your tracks. I would do this, but the midi files would never line up with the grid. Yes, I was in BEATS AND BARS. Well, after two days, I figured out how to fix the grid problem, which was inside Pro Tools... you have to make sure even the GRID is in BEATS AND BARS. At that point, the program seemed to be working okay, but then I could never get a tempo problem fixed in Pro Tools. The tempo errors were: the plug in played drum tracks at one speed, but then Pro Tools played them in another. Couldn't seem to get EZ DRUMMER to communicate with PRO TOOLS in regards to the tempos. Then EZ DRUMMER started playing .... 'slower'. Affected by the tempo/automatic tempo in Pro Tools? Tried playing around with this. Adjusted everything you could possible adjust in Pro Tools MIDI, Tempo, the GRID, you name it. Spent HOURS on this, to no avail. Checked message boards AD NAUSEUM... one of them said to install the latest version of the software... because there was a tempo problem in the earlier version. But BEWARE... to do this, you have to have the program already installed or the 'patch' won't work. So I went to the Toontrack website, and downloaded the latest version, and tried installing 20 times. Kept getting errors having to do with the registry, or telling me some Cab files were corrupt. Standard errors 1316, and (I forgot the other one.. 2350??!!) The install WOULDN'T WORK. Went to message boards to try and research the errors... tried literally seven or eight fixes (having to do with clearing the Temp folders, and CAB errors, and using the command prompt to clear the errors)... even replacing the Windows Installer from the Microsoft website... even tried disabling the 'cab' files in the WinRAR, before putting the download on the desktop and running it from there... and restarting the computer every time for at least 8 occasions.. could never get the software update to work.Never mind even getting / figuring out how to use the program.Don't buy this. My computer was MADE for music creation, and I could not get it to work for me. I find it hard to believe people can make this thing work. They must all have MASTERS DEGREES in COMPUTER SCIENCE."

The graphics are very good, and some of the characters are funny, but this is definitely NOT my favorite game.My daughter (11) thinks this game is just OK, she liked Deception Island much better and she got kind of frustrated with a couple of puzzles (the squirrel confused her), but she was glad she got it.I would recommend this game, but I would also suggest having a cheat-sheet or walk through handy before you tear your hair out!"

Unless you zoom in see where it tells the road is you don't know that it is guessing and showing an appoximate location where there isn't road at all. These guesses are rarely close to the real location. I give it three stars being overall accurate. If I used it in an area that I didn't know well I wouldn't completely trust it."

64398,1,"I started using Zone Labs products dating back to 2003, starting with its free firewall software to the Zone Alarm Pro and eventually updated and upgraded to the Zone Alarm Security Suite a couple of years ago. Overall, it is still one of the better security suite software programs on the market, although this is not saying much (the degeneration of quality in security suite software from major software companies is seemingly getting worse with each year). Nevertheless, it is still much better than either McAfee or Norton's 2007 security suite programs, which I've tested at work and home.If you are someone who believes that you must or would prefer having a security suite software program, Zone Alarm remains a good choice, but it is one that comes with caveats and a need for some understanding.Strengths::Probably the best feature of Zone Alarm, and what it's best known for, is its firewall. It also provides excellent email, IM, and has at least adequate anti-virus and anti-spyware capability (you should be advised to have an anti-spyware backup for any security suite software).Weaknesses::It seems like with each newer version of Zone Alarm security suite, my computer gets a little slower on start-up, CPU usage, and it is now beginning to delve into the realm of more frequent scans and very interruptive updates. This has always been a problem with Zone Alarm, because it is not a program for beginners. If you're looking for a security suite program you can install and just leave to its own devices to care for your computer, Zone Alarm products are not for you.ZASS is only as good as you allow it to be. That means you must configure the product upon installation. If you don't, you're going to be on the receiving end of a lot of warning screens. As a result, ZASS won't be able to apply all of its protections for your computer and software. This means that you must familiarize yourself with the program, allow it to configure your level of expertise, and by all means go into the ZA on your toolbar and frequently look at its features after the tutorial. The better you are at using this program, the easier it will be for you to navigate using your computer while ZASS is protecting it.Recommendation::Admittedly, I stopped using ZASS recently for my work computer, because of its aforementioned problems, although I still use it happily on my PC at home. The speed at which my work computer operates now is much improved, and for the most part I believe my computer is probably as safe as my home computer (minus Zone Alarm's excellent firewall).If I have any advice, it is to ask yourself what your priorities are for your computer. If you are not basing your computer on speed of usage, but security above all else, and you're someone that is willing to surrender a little speed to maintain your security needs, then you are likely best suited for Zone Alarm. As noted, it is still far superior as a program to either McAfee or Norton's newest security suite software, and it is likely the best in providing overall security for your computer. Still, I can't stress enough that you need to acquaint yourself with this program, particularly after installation."

82519,2,"Yes! There is a better option. I considered this item and based on the not so great reviews on the Earthmate, instead bought the Royaltek Saphire Mouse (Search Google for Royaltek). At $199.00, it's a great product and I can use it on both my Toshiba Handheld PC E-330 (Royalteck has adapters for almost all PDA's and Handheld PC's) or my Compaq laptop. The IGuidance software works flawlesly and updates every 3 seconds. Just returned from DC yesterday, it does not miss one turn, the voice navigation is very accurate. If you do, quickly recalculates the route or tells you how to return. It also works with MS Streets 2003, althought at 15 seconds updates. You can actually run both programs at the same time, but only track with one program at a time. Drawbacks? Messing with the cables, and sometimes getting the PC to see the GPS. Just play with it until you get to know it and you'll be very happy to have it. And... no.... I'm not a salesperson trying to sell a product. Maybe Amazon will offer this GPS soon. Happy GPSsing."

80258,1,"If you own CS2 and are on-the-fence about whether to move to CS3, here are some points to ponder:1. What kind of user are you? If you are a casual user, you're probably fine with CS2. The new version is not going to knock your socks off.2. How much do you use the older version? If you're in CS2 quite a bit, then CS3 will improve your workflow and save you enough time to pay for itself pretty quickly. Not only does it load and process more quickly than the older version, many processes that preciously took multiple steps can now be done with one or two clicks of the mouse.3. Do you intend to invest in training, how-to books, et cetera? If so, get CS3. Most of the training is targeted at the newer product. Why train (or write training materials) on something that is already obsolete?4. Why do you want to upgrade? If you just gotta have the latest technology then you're going to buy it anyway. If you need to budget your spending, CS3 is faster, more productive and more versatile than CS2. The improvements in COLOR to B&W; conversion alone made the switch worthwhile for me. I do not have a lot of extra cash to spend, and I thought long and hard before making the purchase, but I am glad that I did. I find the product has enough improvements to justify the expense. However, the changes are not so radical as to make this a ""Must-Have"" upgrade for everyone."

MSDN comes in many 'shapes and sizes,' with probably one variation to fit your needs/budget too. Universal fits my needs. There's academic pricing available on MSDN also I believe.Arguably there's no reason for a private individual to subscribe to MSDN Universal each year. Also, don't take their support events too seriously (you get four freebies with Universal); they don't exactly jump to help - it seems more like ""if we find something that can help you fine, if not oh well."""
10653,0,"I recently gave up on using a PC, to many problems with automatic windows updates crashing my system. I am a small business user. Using MS Office for Mac 2004 found that most everything works pretty well. Have some trouble getting used to the differences and have problems with cut and paste from documents created in Word 2007 to the Mac version. Excell is OK, I use a statistical macro add-in package (QI macros)that works just fine (do SPC, PPAP's FMEA's, CpK's, ANOVA's and Gage R & R's etc for automotive submittals and all have worked). Dissapointed that not all the templates for Word are not in the Mac version. MS arrogance I guess. On a scale of 10 I'd give it a 6."
44923,1,"This product is incredibly easy to use. There are so many cards and projects to choose from and they are all organized by category. I like being able to personalize the back of the card where it says &quot;created just for you by me&quot;. I don't understand why people want to cover up the Hallmark symbol on the back of the card. That's one of the things I like most about this product, especially since you can print them on Hallmark paper and send them in a Hallmark envelope. They look like you bought the cards at the store (but they are personalized). This was a great purchase."
89434,0,"I downloaded the full demo from the company website. It is a VERY basic finance tracking software; I don't think that its worth the $80 to buy, but then again, its only competitor, Quicken, has had such bad reviews that I doubt there are any reliable options for personal finance software for the Mac system.The register is very basic and sometime annoying because if you double click on a name, it assumes you want to change the name and not access the account. Minor annoyance but I think it needs to be mentioned in a review. There is also no place to store the account information (account number, bank routing number, etc) unless you make it part of the account name.On a larger note, if you focus in on a date range (the only option because cleared and reconned info remains in the screen) a glitch often changes your balance. Caused a lot of panic until I realized it was not my doing. Now I don't trust the program for a real balance; something that you may want in a personal finance program."

And they have also improved many of the tools like contour, text to path and font formating tools. Also the sheer quantity of export and import formats supported make Corel extremely easy to use with other packages and formats.If you are using any version of CorelDRAW prior to 11 I would advise you to upgrade to 13 as it's great value for money."

10279,1,"It's Microsoft Access at a great price! I tried to use OpenOffice's database software at home, but it just didn't work for me (it was so different than Access, and it lacked many simple/handy features that are standard in Access...like easily adding records to a table using copy/paste). I originally used Access 2000 at work and now use Access 2007 at work. There isn't a whole lot of difference between 2000 and 2007...FOR THE HOME/PERSONAL USER. So, if you are doing a personal/home project by juggling spreadsheets and manual entry, give Access a try...it has saved me a bunch of time. And if you write error checking queries, then it will do quality control on your data too. Very handy."
1887,0,"I was convinced I had to have this product, so I ordered it, only to encounter all sorts of compatibility problems with Apple's nifty iTunes software (free). After getting much earnest advice about creating different extension folders, disabling certain authorizations, etc., etc., I asked myself what this program does that iTunes doesn't. Practically nothing, except for cleaning up surface noise on 78's, and should I get to that point, I'll download a free little software program called &quot;Coaster.&quot; In short, if you have iTunes, save yourself the money and confusion. iTunes will not only arrange your CD library but duplicate it, not to mention encode, convert, and burn your MP-3s and AIFFs. Wish I'd used the money to replace the broken toaster in the kitchen."
11172,0,"My daughter played the game and she did enjoy it. She finished it over 3 short sessions, but would lose interest after about 30 minutes. Moving through the screens seems slow and awkward. Sometimes it seemed hard to figure where to go next and I was the one trying to figure it out.The animation was nice and you can increase the difficulty level. But it don't expect it to be very educational. It is a game with some light reading mini-games inserted awkwardly into the game play.If you want better educational software, I would pick up the Jumpstart Advanced games in the red boxes. Those games seem more geared to education and I felt they were worth the money. I would avoid the newer Jumpstart Advanced World games in the gold boxes as they require you to pay a subscription."

I was very very dissapointed. It starts you out with a full sentence and words are conjugated. Now, since I took Spanish I knew what it meant, but to new learners...it is forcing you to guess, basically just to memorize not uderstand. It needs to have more explaination and some type of lesson on vocab words and grammar. Simple things like what does ""el"" mean. It is so simple, but to new learners, they may not know.

There are many free or inexpensive programs that create PDFs. If you want to combine multiple PDFs into a single document, you need the real Adobe Acrobat program. Acrobat 6.0 Standard handles basic PDF handling functions. It doesn't have some of the newer features, but it does the basics almost as well as the newest program. At some point I plan to upgrade, but Acrobat 6.0 is a good starting program."
78052,2,"[Copied here from a blog post of mine as this will be of interest to any OS X user buying this game]I really dislike buying desktop computer games. The software quality is poor, and the vendor support is usually lousy.Unfortunately my 9yo prefers Mac games to Wii games, so when he's earned a big incentive for overcoming a real challenge, we end up with another OS X game.It's just as well there are so few of them.The latest problem came with Aspyr's Lego Star Wars (DVD) (Mac) (2005). After I'd installed it my son couldn't play. It started up oddly, with a long video loop. A key press produced a gray screen, then the loop resumed. Finally it crashed.So what was the problem? There's nothing like this on the Aspyr site and the only update patch is a long delayed and apparently troublesome fix supporting native execution on Intel Macs. I was running the game on my PPC G5 Mac.I suspected a security/privileges bug. Game vendors, who usually outsource development to very junior engineers in international markets, rarely bother with security models. They build to the usual XP assumption (everyone runs as admin) then port the game to OS X.Sure enough, from my admin account the game worked. I suspect the game tries to write to the Application folder. That's a no-no. Non-admin users on my system, including my usual account, don't have write privileges in the global Application folder.I could have reinstalled to the user-specific application folder, but then the other kid accounts on the family machine would need their own installs. Since Leopard gives more control over permissions, I could have installed in a folder that everyone could write to.In our case though I have an external drive with open space. OS X doesn't enforce permissions on external drives, so after installing there everyone could use it.PS. On my G5 the game defaulted to lowest resolution. I set it to the penultimate resolution and it worked find and looked MUCH better."
8490,1,"Naturally Speaking Standard 7 is the best voice recognition software I have used since I first began using voice software in 1998. I have had other software programs, but I have found Dragon to be the best. I have versions 5, 6 and now 7. I find version 7 sophisticated and accurate. In using the software, I experienced no problems with getting it to adjust to my voice patterns. I estimate a 96.5 to 97.5 percent accuracy on the very first run when dictating at an average speed. The clearer I speak, the more the accuracy improved. I use the headphones/microphone that comes with it. I have found that the best way to use this software is to speak as if I were a newscaster - no slang, minimal accent of slurring of words, and simple emphasis on key words. I use this software for graduate level research writing. It requires some training, but this software is a lifesaver (ie huge time saver). If you have been told like me, ""If only you could write as well as you speak"", then buy Dragon Naturally Speaking 7, you will be amazed how easy it is to use. Caution though, your computer must have the minimum recommended capabilities, or you will get disappointing results. Enjoy!"

19221,2,"Purchased this hoping to have something to work on my new Mac since my previous filter (that I did like) didn't have a version that would work on it. Short review: Net Nanny has never worked as promised. Long review: Tech support consisted of asking me to write and email with a screen shot of where I was having an issue (as if there was only one!) and waiting a couple days to hear back with some generic advice that did not ever work. The process was PAINFULLY slow. What I can do with Net Nanny: I can physically take possession of my daughter's computer and log into Net Nanny to look at the logs of where she's been going on the Internet. (To be honest, this feature is also disappointing and often doesn't reveal much about the websites visited.) What I can't do but paid for: I cannot check via my computer the web administration with viewable logs of where my daughter has been going on the Net. I also do not, nor have ever, received the email reports of her Internet activity that are supposed to be a feature of this filter. At the same time, when I log into Net Nanny on my daughter's computer (the only way I can see her Internet activity) the program often doesn't recognize my password and I have to request a new one. Frustrating. Full disclosure: I did not purchase this software on Amazon but did go to Amazon afterwards to see the reviews to determine if anyone else was having such a hard time with this product. Wish I would have looked BEFORE purchasing. I give it one star because there is no option for ""NO"" stars. Net Nanny is worse than just wasted money, it's wasted time, and a big, fat headache to boot. You have been warned!"

Instead I have found myself keeping it updated monthly, cos its so easy to jump into the program and make changes to it.The newest version has a new interface that is more user friendly and I the whole program a lot more manageable. My only criticism of the last version is that there was so much on the screen you didn't know where to start.I would recommend any business owner or wannabe business owner to get themselves a copy of this software."

I've had Nero version 6 for more than a year. I gotta when it first came out, and they have constantly and consistently added upgrades every few weeks free to download. What's nice is they don't have you pay for version 6 .5. Like most companies do.Nero burning ROM is just a very intricate CD burning program.Nero vision express is a very basic video editor, but it does the job. The one thing I like about Nero vision express is that it allows me to import replay TV, video files, render them and then I can edit them and Premier Pro.When you buy this product you buying software that will be consistently upgraded and you won't be nickel and dime.

Close ALL other applications including your antivirus software, BEFORE starting the install. Windows 7 will warn you that it is incompatible with some drivers, but the message is non-specific. I just ignored and proceeded. It works just fine. The fellow that I got this tip from has had it running for over a year. Microsoft's compatibility web page still lists CAC as incompatible, however from my experience, this is simply untrue for version 8.It is evident that CreataCard version 8 was produced in a 32 bit version. It is probable that earlier versions were 16 bit and Windows 7 does not have the ability to run 16 bit applications.You do NOT need XP compatibility mode or Win7 Professional version."

I had thought about getting the newer version, but when I read the reviews and found that a lot of the basics were missing, I opted for the old version. It does have its quirks, though. For example, you cannot drag an object ""over"" another - like a dresser over a bed - you have to move it as if these were real solid objects. It makes for a bit of frustration, but I don't mind. If you are looking for a basic layout program, this is one to consider."

I didn't even need the manual. Just selected Disk - Disk and in 28 minutes it was completed. I turned off my computer and swapped hard drives and re-booted. Exact duplicate and everything runs fine.Count my 4 stars as a PLUS for this product. Yes, you have to enter your license number each time you make a copy, but it just takes a second to type it in and a small price to pay for the power of this product."
91533,2,"I was excited about this product. Kids are so used to hand-held gadgets (PSP2, MP3 players, etc.) that I thought this was a great idea. I envisioned my kid ""playing"" with it while traveling to sports events and in study hall at school, to supplement books and Kaplan software. My kid liked using it, for about 2 weeks.That's how long it took for the LCD screen to develop a huge blob which made the screen completely unreadable. And you guessed it, the screen is not covered by the warranty so Franklin won't replace the unit. The case is semi-soft, which is not enough to protect the unit in the average backpack. If you do decide to get this unit, be warned that it's fragile despite the fact that it's evidently designed to be carried around by teenagers. I won't waste my money again buying another unit for my younger kid."

One you get all your paw and purr awards it is just the same rescues over and over again.And also the thing that annoys me the most is that you can never keep any parrots once you rescue them. Also how do you know if the turtles were not wild to begin with? On the positive side the puppie kittens and rabbits were so life like. Overall a good game but play only if you are really bored and you need to pass the time.

If you want to learn it you should be comitted to research book like Adobe's Classroom in a Book or any other kind of tutorial book. I use this software at a professional level. I send DVD masters for mass reproduction every month and Encore has never failed me. I just upgraded to HDV and it handles it well too. I used to use Ulead DVD and as soon as I got Encore my whole production changed. I start my film in Premiere, tweak it in After Effects and DVD authoring in Encore and done, ready for reproduction."

86782,1,"Both of my children have thoroughly enjoyed the Cluefinder Series, especially this 3rd Grade Edition. I have tried many similar products but have found them to be either to heavy on the education, thereby losing the kids interest, or too heavy on the fun and they don't really learn much. In this product, the children get to work with a small group of kids (whom they may know already from other Cluefinders adventures)as they seek to solve the story/mysteries. I love the way the kids get rewarded for progress during their journey, providing even more incentive to continue. And the best part of all: they really do learn! During dinner one evening, my son showed off some of the math skills he had learned quite far in advance of his school classmates. And it wasn't just rote memorization. He had really learned the concepts. My hat is off to The Learning Company!"
9000,1,I can't add much to the previous reviews. However i do want to point out that disc spanning is not supported if you use the remote burning feature. If you try to burn to a remote computer you will get an error message saying you can't span discs. I was trying to not have to upgrade the DVD/CD hardware in an older Mac on my network by using the remote burning feature.Other than that Toast 7 meets all my needs.
38786,1,"I started creating web sites about a dozen years ago. Back then there were lots of inexpensive easy to use Mac programs for creating simple web pages like Adobe PageMill, and Claris HomePage. Gradually the complex expensive programs like DreamWeaver took over the market and companies discontinued the easier to use products. That was fine for the professionals, but it left the non-professional, the person who wants to occasionally create or maintain a simple web site in the lurch. With the professional programs the learning curve was too steep and the cost to much for the casual user.I had been limping along on my old version of Claris HomePage for many years. A great program, but it only ran under the Mac classic OS. I was hoping against hope that someone would have pity on us poor amateurs and create a easy, cheap program that would run under OS 10.When I heard of Freeway Express it sounded like what I was looking for. I down loaded a fully functional 30 day demo, did a simple online tutorial, and redid my web site. By then I was a believer. I bought the package. The program is everything the advertising claims. It is easy to learn, offers an intuitive desktop publishing like user interface, and is priced way less than professional packages. If one does evolve into wanting more sophistication it is easy to upgrade to the professional version.The one drawback is that you can't edit pre-existing web sites created by other programs or even other people. That is because Freeway uses a proprietary working file that is only turned into HTML when you publish or test your site. This also has advantages, however. You can easily create graphic text items that will look the same under all circumstances. Then you can go back and edit them as if they were, regular text. Freeway uses tables to create your pages but you don't have to ever think about that. Just drag and drop items anywhere on the page and Freeway create the necessary tables, and often very complex ones, for you when you publish your site.My site looked perfect in IE, Firefox, and Safari. I highly recommend this product for the casual web author who doesn't want to become web coding expert."
15576,2,"Panda has the most astonishingly bad tech support I have ever encountered. If you do get a response from them, it could be weeks or months later. Their AV technology is really great--I am convinced that Panda provides some of the best AV and spyware protection--but the nearly nonexistent support means I'll ""just say no"" to Panda next time. If I could give it a ""four and a half stars"" for protection, and a ""minus two"" for support, I would.P.S.: 1. You'll probably need support once in a while, as the install can be buggy, and the program occasionally (though rarely) acts up, 2. the program updates at the most inopportune times without notification even though it has been set to inform you when it is updating, and, 3. And perhaps worst of all, this program absolutely refuses to uninstall, even via add/remove programs and CCleaner.By the way, I am writing this review offline in notepad, so I can go online and post the review without spending much time online and unprotected, since my Panda is currently unusable. I'll be installing AVG's free AV shortly (I've used it at work, and no problems)."
33495,0,"I have Bryce 4 which I'm running on a 600MHz cpu with 128RAM and I recently got a chance to play with B5 on a 1.8 GHz machine with 512RAM. Incredibly, the new version on hardware with 3x the oomph of my own system was SLOWER to render!!...and boys 'n girls, Bryce's slow rendering engine is already the ickiest, least acceptable part of the package. Okay, so you can supposedly distribute the rendering chores over multiple computers in a network now but y'know, I only have the one machine and it's the same story for most home users, I'd suspect. This is a really inadequate &quot;fix&quot; for the software's worst problem.Yes, there's good stuff here, too. :) The new tree lab is a significant improvement but again, you'll just add to the rendering nightmare if you use it. I like the new light controls, too, and the terrain editor is better. The disappointment in Bryce comes from seeing the potential for glory, the means by which you can play God and create your own worlds in convincing detail, but not quite being able to get there and having to skimp on the details in an eternal battle to keep down the rendering times. Much of what you'll want to do with it can be achieved if you only do web graphics and keep to relatively low resolutions: go no higher than 800x600 pixels for wallpaper or whatever and a fairly complex creation will take hours to render, but if you want to do a 300dpi file for a 5&quot;x7&quot; print...2100x1500 pixels...you need to keep the composition very simple, no plants, minimal glass, metal and reflective stuff...and you'll probably need to leave your 'puter on overnight, anyway. :( Turn off your wallpaper, turn off your screensaver, close everything else you can (basically, burn all the furniture in your house to keep warm!), whisper prayers and incantations, do whatever you have to do to give every spare ounce of processor power to Bryce while it's rendering. *sigh* Maybe you'll avoid a crash, at least.Final note: I know this is for the home user, not for pros, but that doesn't mean it can't get a lot better than it is and I'm thinking good thoughts for the next few releases--but saving my $$ for now. I've been a CorelDRAW! and Photo-Paint user for years and I have every confidence Corel will do great things with Bryce, but they're not there yet."
35608,1,"I have been a Goldmine user for the last four years, but after downloading the free trial version of ACT! 6.0 from their web site, I decided to switch. ACT! 6.0 has a much nicer graphical interface and more enriched features than previous releases. ACT! 6.0 integrated nicely with my outlook XP so that I am able to compose and read messages that are sent with Outlook from within the ACT! console. This is a nice feature because email retrieved by ACT! this way can be scanned by my anti-virus software. The library tab is a nice added feature and it allows you to associate several media type files with your contact.Data conversion for me was quick. I found it fairly easy to set up custom field and reports within ACT. I would recomend this product strongly to anyone who is in the market for contact software. If you are already an Outlook user, this product is particular nice because of its integration with that program."
16003,2,"I guess I am the only computer professional that thinks Windows XP's build-in defragger is better. I've always thought after PerfectDisk, the system runs SLOWER, but everyone seems to rave about how good it is. Finally, I decided to put my concerns to rest. I imaged my drive, and tested both Windows' build-in defragger and PerfectDisk on the same imaged drive. Windows' runs a lot faster but probably did not fully defrag every file. PerfectDisk took almost 3 times longer to complete, AND made the system SLOWER. I benched my system after the defrag, and the PerfectDisk defragged system is signficiantly slower and had a significant increase in random full-seeks. I believe in an attempt to defrag completely, PerfectDisk moved the files around too much and completely screwed up Windows' prefetching ability and cause prefetching to be ineffective. I also concluded that related files are moved a part, which caused potential full-stroke access to read files that were neighboring prior to defrag. I have stopped using PerfectDisk. I realize that it defrags more complete than Windows' build-in utility, however, the reason to defrag is to increase system performance and reduce disk access delays. Unfortunately for PerfectDisk, it actually slowed the system down and increased average disk access time. Unless you defrag only once a year and have a really fragmented file system, you will not notice any improvements."
82012,1,"this program is not bad, it's relatively easy to use and to build the basic shell and interior of your home.

81316,1,"I had been living in Shanghai China for about 8 months and found myself trapped at home watching bootleg DVDs and eating at high priced resturants. From the moment I started Fluenz my local staff was impressed with my quick pickup of elements of the language. In fact they started speaking more Shanghainese as it became apparent I could understand them!Fluenz customer service is also top notch. When Paypal delayed giving them my payment, I told them I needed the product in two days (because I was flying back to China) it showed up no questions asked! Even better - when they upgraded the initial version, they sent it to me without asking.The podcasts are good reviews and are very helpful. I find Rosetta Stone annoying and not very helpful. I really don't need to tell anyone that the Elephant was playing ball with the boy. The Fluenz approach is much more practical and useful from day one.I did not give 5 stars because I feel that including optional display of Chinese Characters would make the product that much better. OVERALL - GREAT."

50430,1,"Recently, I purchased this product from (...) and was very pleased with it. There was a hitch installing it on my laptop, so I contacted the retailer who promptly put me in touch with a representative from Interactive Drama for quick resolution of the problem.The four-CD ""Arabic Series"" is an excellent program for those of us with formal instruction in the language. DO NOT purchase this software to learn Arabic; you will be disappointed. The program is excellent at developing and polishing speaking skills in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Additionally, two of the four CDs have an option for working in the Iraqi dialect.I was initially frustrated with the program, because all of the interactive interviewees only understood some of the phrases I spoke to them. Once I followed the developers instructions of working in a quiet room with no background noises to confuse the computer and began clearly enunciating the words and speaking in a manner in which I smoothly transitioned from word-to-word within a phrase and in which I spoke at the same speed as the interactive instructor, the interactive interviewees understood me much more often.Almost all language software on the market now has some sort of speech recognition capability that is supposed to grade your speech in the language being taught, and most of it doesn't work. I've seen such software tell me I'm excellent at speaking a given phrase while my native-speaking Arabic instructors are average. Interactive Drama's four-CD ""Arabic Series"" speech recognition capability REALLY works, as it should for this price. I highly recommend it."

82964,1,"I have not purchased the Spanish product, but I bought many of the Transparent Language modules for learning French. Transparent Language provides an incredible value for the money. I spent a lot more than $99 for the individual add-ons, so I agree with those who say this is a bargain. You get multi-sensory learning through reading, listening, watching videos (including contemporary TV shows), and through microphone feedback to ensure correct pronunciation. The base program provides numerous tools to facilitate language learning.I am a parent educator who selected the educational materials myself after considerable research. I am writing this review because I am concerned there are people writing such incredibly disparaging reviews that they have no relation to reality. It is much more likely they represent competing products than the people writing positive reviews. The positive reviews line up with what I found with the French version.Regards,Phil"

I uninstalled it before installing Micro Trend Internet Security which work fine.The nice thing about it is that it keeps up with regularly updates I get for free for a year.One thing I don't like about this program is its interface which is not as great as the previous one.

65277,1,"If you are a Mac household or even a home based business that runs on Macs, it would be hard to go wrong buying the .Mac service. Yes of course there are some aspects of free services such as google applications, yahoo or Windows live that provide some of these features, but not when you consider the entire package and how well it is integrated with your Mac experience.One of my favorite aspects is the ability to Sync to Macs effortless over the internet. I have an iMac and a MacBook Pro and I am able to keep favorites, calendars, and settings between the two machines synced. I can even keep the same group of widgets on both Macs.Next, I really like the space for a web page. Using iWeb you can easily create a great looking site without knowing one line of XML code. I literally had Apple as a web host and an iWeb page up within an hour or two. iDisk is very reasonable online storage, you have a virtual disk that allows your to store your treasured family photographs away from your house and a potential disaster.Groups is an area that I want to get going soon as well, here you can have a family web page for instance or a group for your book club, soccer team or whatever. Any person that you give access to can reach it (on Mac, PC or Linix) and share important information.The backup program I do not use much because I do have backup routines at home, but again here you could back all of your photographs or music on a regular basis (subject to the storage limit)All and all, I'd expect Apple to continue to get m4 $100 per year"

60919,0,"To learn another language requires a strong desire to do so and a total commitment to succeed. We all learned our first language by listening to others talk, and then copied what they said to get our ideas across. And we failed many times, but we learned how tomaster the language.This course works in a simmilar manner. But, you must really want to learn German and work at it. There are no easy fixes.The first CD, Talk Now! German is great. These speakers speak as native speakers. And we learned many useful words.The second CD, World Talk German world be easier to follow if the speakers were native speakers of German from Germany. And if the planners of this CD displayed real German people instead of cartoons with sun glasses. However, one can get some help from this CD by working hard at it. Just remember to change your speech later.The third CD is good. The translations are correct and your mouse will define German words into English, even after the CD is removed. This is a big help when reading German text on Web pages or when translating E-mail.The forth CD is a fun and interesting &quot;game&quot;. One must think and if you pay close attention, you can really get totally immered in the thought and language learning process.But, still other tutorials will be required for many students in order to learn German well.My first choice of an excellent CD-Rom based course would be Learn German Now! by Transparent Language. This one goes to the head of the class, because it teaches reading, writting, listening, speaking, and understanding German. And it is available from Amazon."
4583,1,Arabic Now is a very good software when it comes to language learning. I was intrested in trying to learn a new language(s) and decided to try a different approach other than taking classes and I am very glad I tried this out. Arabic Now might seem a bit imposing at first but that is only because it has so much to offer. Most other language software out there lacks some crucial feature or aspect of the language but this program seems to cover everything from grammar to vocabulary to pronunciation to reading/writing and listening skills. With all this exposure to Arabic my ability to use the language increased rapidly and I was very satisfied with the results. Arabic Now is a great way to teach yourself Arabic!!!

2930,1,"I'm really surprised by some of the other reviewer's negative comments regarding this product. I was given the Punch! 5-in-1 program as a Christmas present and then purchased the Punch! 3000 program a couple of years later. When I got the Punch! 5-in-1 I had never used a CAD program before and really had very pretty limited experience with using computers in general. I have not run into any of the difficulties or limitations that the other reviewers complained about so I suspect that they just haven't learned to use the program.Punch! 3000 is pretty complicated but that's because it has a LOT of tools. I'm actually glad I started with the much less ""robust"" 5-in-1 program because it didn't overwhelm me and 3000 might have.I am not an architect but am nevertheless currently in the process of actually building my dream home exactly as I designed it using Punch!3000. It is a 2 story, 3 bedroom, 3 1/2 bath, with wraparound porch, backyard decks, and a complex roomline that includes dormers. I designed every piece of it down to the foundation, plumbing, HVAC, and sidewalks. Yes, I did take my Punch!3000 plans to a professional designer and engineer to prepare working blueprints because I wanted a professional to verify that what I had planned was actually buildable...that the ""physics"" would work.But, it turned out that the only changes recommended to my design were slight variations (inches) in the lenths of a couple of room so as to take advantage of stock sizes of building materials and some changes to the electrical wiring scheme so as to balance the anticipated electrical loads better (i.e., get all the big appliances OFF the same circuit.) My designer said he'd seen a lot of stock house plans with a whole lot more problems than my design had.I did get a bit frustrated with how slowly Punch 3000! prepared live view renditions when my design got complicated but I suspect that the slow rendition was more due to limitations in my computer's memory than anything inherent in the program. And, I didn't actually ever use the Animator tool (played around with it a little but didn't really feel the need to ""make a movie"" of my house plans.)All in all, I think Punch!3000 is a great program and, while I'm glad to be finally building my dream home, I'm kind of sorry that I will no longer have any excuse for spending hours-on-end playing with this program and tweaking my design! Then again, I haven't done anything yet with the landscaping tools and I'll have almost 3 acres to landscape when we get moved in ... ;)"

This is pretty neat, too, but I think the Plus! version looks more realistic. This one has more features and is more customizable, but when you get right down to it, the Microsoft one looks more real and that is the whole point of a screen saver like this, in my opinion. I don't mean to bash the product too much (I did give it 3 stars)--the fish themselves look great. It's just that their movements are not as believable and sometimes they swim through rocks and things (the z-buffering is not right). The optional sound effects are advertised as ""soothing"", but I found them annoying. All in all, a good product, but I disagree with the claim, ""So life-like, you will swear the fish are real!"""
41969,1,"I bought this and loaded this on a W2K box with a Pioneer DVR-A03 drive. I was skeptical about its compatibility. I used a TDK DVD-R disk and backed up my Speed Region 2 DVD. Even though it made my one DVD into a two part DVD set, it did allow me to choose the split break, which impressed me. As it is written in its specs, I was also able to have my backup DVD start without going to the menus. This is a feature that I've been looking for, so that my technology challenged parents will be able to use the DVD player I got them for Christmas, with the least amount of effort. My copies worked in my APEX DVD player but didn't in my AIWA player. I was dismayed at first since the AIWA DVD player I have is supposed to be compatible with DVD-R disks. I then used cheap, Princo DVD-R disks on my next attempt and they worked fine in my AIWA and APEX players. I suggest that anyone interested in this product, test several different brands of DVD-R/RW or DVD+R/RW. Compatibility problems could be due to the media you are using and not the software. I hope to try this software with a faster DVD-R drive sometime. Very cool software. I just wish that it could do a little more. I hope that newer versions will have a way to compress it so that it can fit on one single-sided DVD. Something like SVCD quality on a DVD would be really cool."

Now, being someone that travels to Europe on biz, I wanted to load the latest maps so I can both find my way around by car and on foot. These maps are very detailed and provide extremely detailed POIs so you can find that restaurant you need in a jiffy.The only real problem is being able to load all of euope on to the TomTom -- I estimated that there are over 2GB of maps if you load them all. Luckily, I guess, very few of us will need all of europe at a time. I was able to load all of central europe and UK (left out everything above Holland and also Spain/Portugal/Italy. The post code support is limited to 3 of the normal 6 characters in the UK, this is a problem that I understand I can get around by buying the full postcode database.As TomTom gets more popular I am lookingforward to more maps and features."
35071,1,"After reading the others, I can see that my review will have to stand alone. I recently took calculus online at a very good university, but it was really just me alone with the book: No classroom instruction showing problems on the board, etc. It was tough!Then I found this calculus solver, which helped me immensely. You have to teach yourself how to enter the problems correctly into the solver, which may be difficult for some, but I mastered the technique fairly quickly. What a relief! Step-by-step solutions to your homework problems with the correct answer. How can that be bad?Even if you are assigned homework problems with the answers available in the back of the book, it's invaluable to see each step. In addition, there are tutorials explaining calculus concepts, and, yes, this version completes integration problems very successfully!The documentation states that the CD is intended for first year college calculus students. Perhaps others were trying to use it for more advanced courses, beyond Calc I & II?All I know is that I could not have received my perfect 4.0 grade in the course without this calculus solver. I loved it!"
3830,2,"After I installed 8.0 I had to reinstall 7.0 to get my previous Video Wave projects to work correctly. First, 8.0 would not display any text added on the overlay line. When I double-clicked the overlay, I could not edit the text, which was invisible. Also, the ""pan and scan"" that replaced the ""motion pictures"" edit was a huge disappointment. Even in advanced mode, Roxio seems to have simplified the process so that it actually does less than it did before: you cannot conveniently adjust the slide duration here, you cannot zoom in as far as before; and the pre-set ""start"" and ""end"" points are quirky to override and the scan point settings sometimes seem to have a mind of their own. I loved it the way the ""edit motion pictures"" function was before and was hoping that in the new release that you'd be able to ROTATE the panning frame as well. What I didn't expect was a dumbed-down version of what worked so well before. Maybe I ought to go pro."

68357,1,"I've been a big fan of PE for some time, and this is my first upgrade since 2.0. The photo editing tools are fantastic...there's not much missing. I could go on and on about the positive, but let me say a few words why I didn't give this product 5 stars. First, the Organizer could use some improvement in terms of its ability to sort in Folder view. Things like ""renaming"" files does a so-so job; for example it renames with a simple number suffix (pic-1, pic-2, ..., pic 10, ...) But in Folder view, the files are sorted as pic-1, pic-10, pic 11, ... pic 2. A simple ""ascii"" sort. (This is just one example where the Organizer could use some improvement.) Another problem (for me) is the inability to add frequently used commands to the toolbar. I'm scanning literally thousands of slides, and some commands I often use are buried in the menu tree. It's very tedious doing this over and over and over. I'd like to assign some of these to a toolbar or maybe even a ""personal palette."" Third, backing up the catalog (the PE database) is very poorly designed. Doing an incremental backup is not even worth figuring out how to do. So these are my top three negatives. For me, the first two prevented me from awarding PE 5 stars; but overall this product is excellent."

I had taken two years of high school Spanish before using this product and didn't learn as much as I had learned after the first two weeks of using Rosetta stone.

Other than that, I would most definitely recommend it to any one who wants to quickly learn a new language in their spare time."
68348,1,"I have purchased and used every version of Adobe Photoshop Elements since the product was first released - and most recently I upgraded to Photoshop Elements 5.O. I read another review posted here on Amazon in which the reviewer states that a lot of important features are missing from this newest version. Specifically, he says that Elements 5.0 omits two important features - selection brushes and sharpening filters. That is just not true. These features are in the new 5.0 version, so I'm not sure why the reviewer would have said that (unless he is not really familiar with this product).In my opinion, this is the BEST editing software on the market for the money. I don't know of any other product that offers anywhere near power or flexibility for a similar price. I think the upgrade to Elements 5.0 is worth it - ""color curves"" are a great new feature, as are the new artwork and effects that were added to this version. These are a lot of fun and very useful particularly if you enjoy creating scrapbooks.And yes, despite what the prior reviewer says - you CAN adjust the color curve in the Elements 5.0. You may not be able to adjust them to the extent that you can if you were using Photoshop CS2 - but then Photoshop CS2 costs about $500 more than Photoshop Elements 5.0. Besides, its a lot easier to learn how to use color curve in Elements.I know that many people rely on reviews here at Amazon to help them decide whether to buy a product - I know that I do. I think it is unfortunate that an earlier reviewer made claims about this product that are just plain wrong. I encourage anyone considering Elements 5.0 to research the product and not be mislead by inaccurate information as to its content. Personally, I am very happy with it and I do recommend it.Roberta"

2485,2,"I gave up on 3D Home Architect (look for my other review; hereinafter called 3D HA) and decided to try out one or two others. Next up is Total 3D Home. As expected from other reviewers' comments, it won't work for me but I'll try to give a bit more detail on what you'll find. Unfortunately the ""professional"" reviewers at Consumer Reports and the PC magazines won't tell you what you'd really like to know.The good news with this one: it's a heckuva lot faster than 3D HA. You can click and drag things around much more speedily, and it doesn't hog your processor and memory anywhere near as much.Now the bad news. Plenty of that, starting with a rather piggish software installation (it says on the box you need 1.8 gigs, and it really isn't kidding. You'll save a modest amount by telling it not to load all of the 3rd CD but still...)Let me back up by pointing out the overall workflow flaw found in ALL of these home-design programs: they don't work with you the way an actual architect would. What's the first question that a professional (whether it's the guy at the Home Depot kitchen department, or the Martha Stewart's personal designer) going to ask? Well, it all starts with measurements. Generally, a guy will come out to your house and measure everything down to the inch, in all three dimensions. The professional will start with a mockup (be it in pencil or in a CAD system) with the precise details of your existing structure, and if they're really good, they'll come back through your home on a second visit to double-check all measurements. Only then will changes to your home be proposed.Well, that's not how these programs work. Total 3D is really different from the others so I'll try to describe the data-entry process; this procedure will be helpful whether or not you buy this package because the embedded help is no help at all. When you start the program, you'll see 7 tabs across the bottom of the screen. Three of them are relevant for creating a sketch of your existing structure: ""Space Plan"", ""Design Plan"", and ""Walk Through"". If you have used other programs, the ""Design Plan"" screen looks pretty much like the others. With Total 3D, you're expected to input your floor plan in the ""Space Plan"". The first thing you'll notice is that the proposed rooms (Kitchen, Hall, Bedroom, Closet, etc) are all rectangles. And you'll walk around your own house and conclude that most rooms resemble rectangles but aren't quite...so how do you get this program to recognize your reality?Here is a key hint not mentioned in this program's help: if you overlap two rooms (a real one and a fake one) in the Space Plan, then momentarily click on the Design Plan tab, then go back to the Space Plan and delete the fake room, you can generate a real room with a corner taken out of it. You can chop multiple corners out if you use multiple ""fake"" rooms by this technique. No need to be precise with dimensions at the outset: I'd recommend starting out with the ""Wall and Room Snapping"" pref set to 6 inches, getting the whole floor plan roughed in, and then setting the snap spacing down to 1 inch before clicking and dragging walls (in either view) to match your measurements.That allows you to get the basic layout entered; if your home is all 90- and/or 45-degree angles, on a single floor, and the floors/ceilings are level, you should be able to develop a decent model of your structure. If you're trying to model complex walls, or have multiple floor levels, there are features in 3D Home Architect which go well beyond what you'll find in Total 3D. (I made a very precise model--with difficulty--of my home in 3D HA but quickly concluded that I can't do the same with Total 3D.)As luck would have it, I helped a friend move last Sunday and I decided to throw together a sketch of his new kitchen. With Total 3D, I ran into the following problems:* I couldn't get a couple of the cabinets to stay in place. When I switched from Space Plan to Walk Through and back, the cabinets snapped to a different position along the wall. (Exiting and restarting the program doesn't clear this condition.)* The program doesn't remember what directory you keep your files in. To open an existing plan anywhere other than a subfolder of My Documents, you have to re-navigate to your directory every time. VERY annoying.* Cabinets snap to a side wall even if you don't want them to. I can't figure out how to turn this off.* In the Design view, if you want to modify/move an item, you have to go into Select mode (one of a half-dozen small tabs at the upper right). OK, fine: but sometimes instead of selecting an item it switches to Add or Measure mode, and then if you click again it'll do something completely different from what you intended.* The font sizes in Annotate are hilariously oversized. I really can't add notes to my diagrams.* If you add manual dimensions to a room, good luck trying to figure out how to move or delete them. At least (unlike the vexacious 3D HA) the dimensions are dynamically updated if you move the item (such as a wall) at one end.* Upper cabinets are hung at ceiling level. There's a box where you can enter a new hang height but it beeps angrily if you enter anything.* In fact the program seems to insist that a whole variety of things remain fixed at the ceiling. With 3D HA you have the freedom to raise/lower lighting fixtures and other objects but this doesn't.* There is no ceiling design utility which would allow you to create soffits, trays, or angled sections. The world is flat, or at least the ceilings that you create for it with this program.* The materials paintbrush operates in a truly bizarre way. You select an item, then you get a few options at the upper right and a series of color palettes beneath those. Choose the option (like Tile or Hardwood), then the palette. Then you get a too-limited set of choices. This part of the program simply needs to be yanked out and started over, in my opinion; the palette's broad variety should be the LAST option rather than the 2nd option you'd choose.* You can't do a real electrical plan with this program. This is a SERIOUS omission. If you place a lightswitch on your diagram, it prints out as a barely-visible faceplate rectangle on the floor plan. It should print out as a large industry-standard dollar sign. An outlet should print out with its standard symbol, and so on. If you're redesigning a kitchen, you have to be able to see the electrical items on the floor plan, not just in 3D views.* There is a ""Product Catalog"" in this program. Do not confuse it with anything useful! If you thought that a company like Merillat might have included accurate 3D renditions of its merchandise catalog to include here, you'd be disappointed (especially considering that some rival products actually do have this feature). Here, the product catalog just takes you to a separate screen showing pictures of products that can't be copied into your diagram.* Copy/Paste is hobbled. You can't select multiple items or regions to move or copy. This is a serious handicap. (3D HA v8 has a similar limitation, alas. An older version was fine.)* Like 3D HA, there are no options available for printing. It's a WYSIWYG editor so the only thing you can do is enable/disable on-screen view of various design elements before making hardcopy.* Unlike its rivals, this program has almost no ability to change default options, or user generated libraries, for items to be added. Want your walls 4.5"" thick instead of the program's hardwired 4""? Want to always use a certain style of kitchen cabinet? You'll find only a handful of settings available.My overall impression of this software is very negative. It feels like version 2 rather than version 9. Clearly the developers have fixed some of the bugs (it only crashed once on me) that were reported by other reviewers, but it lacks polish and it lacks the ability to generate precise renditions of your existing home, let alone a polished presentation of what you'd like your renovation to look like.I'll continue roaming the earth for a home-design suite that actually does what I like. Meanwhile it's possible that some of the engineers and marketeers working for one of these companies will actually listen to what we users have to say, and come out with a future version that does what we want, minus all the sluggish code bloat.Specifically, I want to be able to enter a four-column spreadsheet of wall and cabinet dimensions (location, direction, length, height) into a program, have the program turn it into a proposed room layout, let me click/drag the rooms and walls to match my sketch. (Actually, I'd like to have a $100 electronic device that works with a $50 software package that I can walk through the rooms of the house to generate the entire diagram for me automatically.) Then I want to be able to save the whole existing-structure design as a template, and use that file to create a series of what-if scenarios at varying levels of detail (first an overall sketch to show the concept, and then a refined sketch of the final design). It shouldn't be *too* painful in either 2D or 3D mode to apply the finishes that I want.The refined 2D sketch should be presentable to a general contractor and a building inspector to secure bids and permits. I'm not sure how much I care about the 3D views so many developers are wrongly obsessed with.Thanks for listening!"

The steps for entering your bank data in order for it to print on your check is very simple. You can print checks to carry around with you so that they can be handwritten in stores, etc. and you can print check amounts and vendor names with your various computer programs, i.e. Quick Books, Quicken, etc. You can put clip art on your checks, maybe a Christmas Tree at Christmas and so on. I get a lot of compliments from store merchants when using these checks, but my main objective for using them is the BIG SAVINGS !!!"
5644,1,I've loved this game ever since I opened it on Easter. Even if you hate to watch racing you will love this. It is my favorite game. It is easy and you can play with lots of different players. There are lots of race tracks too. It is not a game for just boys.

7433,1,"I did a minimum amount of research before buying this game, so there were really no unpleasent surprises. It works just as the promotional information says it does.I was aware that the game was out for a while before I got it. The newest version, &quot;Warp II&quot;, is already out, but it doesn't offer as many ships, so I decided on the older version.I am an on-line gamer, too, and a big Star Trek fan, but I bought this mostly for the &quot;make your own starship&quot; aspect and not the &quot;gaming&quot; aspect. As far as I am concerned, the starship creation part rocks and the gaming portion is a bonus way to see how your ship performs. If you buy, though, don't forget to get the patch on-line.This version of the game allows you to import a digital picture of anyone you want and create a character out of them to crew your ships. That is very cool, and the only thing I really would want out of the new &quot;Warp II&quot; version is the ability to edit those pictures so that your subject appears to be in a Starfleet uniform -- if it works well. Not enough to make me want to run out and get it, so in the meantime I will enjoy &quot;Creator Deluxe&quot; and wait for &quot;Warp II&quot; to go to the bargain bin.The only reason I did not give this game 5 stars is because I thought the producers could have put a little more into the graphics and animation. Maybe even a little more than &quot;a little more&quot;, but all in all, I really liked it."

27506,1,"Like the other Nancy Drew games, &quot;The Final Scene&quot; was great. In each Nancy Drew game, you get to be the famous detective and solve a mystery. It's not easy, though. You have to search for clues and find secret passageways. You maneuver through the game with your mouse, using arrows and magnifying glasses on the screen -- and sometimes, trinkets and trapdoors can only be found by viewing them at a particular angle. This allows for hours of fun -- or hours of being stuck, whatever. (This is what the HerInteractive site's message boards are for!)The graphics in this game are incredible. The people look 3-D and although they do look a bit robotic, they're realistic and believable. The attention to detail is amazing as well. The scenery is beatiful -- there are cool things to look at that don't really pertain to your mystery, but then again, you don't KNOW for sure if they do or not -- it's always good to keep your eyes open and remember where certain things are.The dialogue is clever and witty, and often funny and silly (but in a good way). My only complaint on this subject is the fact that sometimes the dialogue doesn't make sense -- sometimes a character speaking to you will tell you to try doing something you've already done, and Nancy (you) will say &quot;OK, I'll try that&quot; -- when in fact you've already done it! Obviously the game's programming can't handle ANY eventuality. But whatever. This is a small thing and it is a small annoyance at the most.&quot;The Final Scene&quot; is so fun. All I can ask for in the next Nancy Drew game (and please, PLEASE keep making them!) is more puzzles (there were about five in this game; all pleasantly challenging) and, also, give us more game time! The box says it can take over 20 hours. I did the senior level and had it completed in 6 or 7. Then again, I'm in my twenties. (Yes! Adults, do not be ashamed to play this! I have gotten several of my friends hooked! However, I've also played one of the other games with a 10-year-old... she needed a little help but did pretty well on her own, so this is for all ages!) Also, like many people, I've played the other four games -- so I guess after awhile you get the hang of the games and that makes them go faster.Synopsis: if you want many hours of good, mind-boggling and exciting fun, buy this game. Nancy Drew rocks!"

I purchased this for 2 of my kids. Seemed like the perfect item for them to hone up on their math skills, especially given both have an affinity for soccer. I loaded it up on a new Vista laptop and it simply does not run properly - and what little can be played has error messages popping up left and right. Vista of course is not without its fair share of problems to say the least, but this is not a review of Vista. In fact, this is hardly a review of Soccer Math, since we really never got it to work. This is a review of the company, edVentures, who made it. After three times over 6 months trying to contact their so called ""customer support"" there was zero response. Zero as in zip, nada. We gave up. When a company has no support for its customers and can't even give them the time of day, it does not deserve any customers. Over time people find out and stay away. STAY AWAY!"

37101,1,"This program is a colorful and flashy way to learn some basic Danish vocabulary -- perfect for young learners, especially! I've had a bit of Danish previously, so this wasn't a great challenge. I breezed through it in under 2 days of casual play. (It's also pretty easy to ""guess"", so if you're naturally good at taking quizzes, you might not feel like you're really learning a lot.) I was hoping to pick up a little more Danish so that I could converse with my Danish in-laws. However, there isn't much here in terms of phrases, with the exception of a dozen or so ""tourist"" phrases. I do think it's a fun way for ~~absolute beginners~~ to take a first step into learning Danish. For more in-depth learning, Rosetta Stone is the way to go. This program does have a neat feature to go to online resources to learn more about Denmark and Danish, which I thought was quite enjoyable.I did encounter a program error which crashed the program on two separate operating systems (XP and 2K); the problem was easily remedied by switching from ""American English"" as the help language to ""British English"", however. The online tech support for this product is great, if you need it! :)All in all, it's a very nice first-time Danish program!"

13001,1,"I've been using TurboTax on the Mac since 2001. I've never had a problem. I don't have a very complicated return - the most complicated we had was the first year... married/joint, many different sources of income (regular salaried, severence, unemployment and self-employed - it was a very strange year!), home mortgage, 401(k), 403(b), SEP-IRA, self-employed business expenses and write-off of worthless stock for a company that went belly up. I file electronically and have money auto-deposit or autopay. Have not had any problems.I have installed 2004 on my mac (G5 running OS 10) without so much as a whimper. I'm not worried about state *yet*. Seems to me that if Intuit isn't ready, I can wait. But I don't plan to file until April. Not sure why folks are foaming at the mouth on Jan 13th - seems a bit premature and somewhat ""tantrumy"" to me.BTW, updates this year include an interview thing you do at the beginning that limits the number of forms you have to slog thru. It's definitely an improvement over previous years. Definitely simplified it for me."
6107,1,"As a 6-year Linux user, I am quite used to the inevitable shortcomings of my favorite OS. Ubuntu, however, has removed a lot of the caveats and explanantions I have had to provide non-users in the past. The installer, launched from the Live ""try before you buy"" Ubuntu CD, is intuitive and leaps ahead of other installers. The software list is extensive. The Synaptic software management tool is a sheer delight, once you acquaint yourself with it. Add to this the rock-solid performance of Linux in general and a charming look and feel provided by Canonical's community contributors, and you have a tight Linux package that is worthy to be tried by anyone. The community-based support tools rarely fail. If you can Google up data, you can easily find help with Ubuntu.The real quibbles would be the nagging lack of support out-of-box for proprietary file formats and hardware compatibility, but with a bit of thought and some net-searches for solutions (and don't forget the community pages!), most everything can be sorted out.All said, Linux is still more ""work"" than the Microsoft and Apple offerings, but the work is well worth it, thanks to the hard working folks at Canonical."

More importantly, though, my software suddenly &quot;lost&quot; one much-used quad sheet, leaving white space in it's place on my screen. I also lost all the markers and trails associated with that area, which included several day's work. Called their customer service for assistance and was connected to a very rude, arrogant, and unhelpful technician. Result: no fix. The company needs to back an excellent product with helpful and knowledgable technicians."

The registry utilities are smart and effective, along with the junk files utilities. There are two areas to use extreme caution. One is the start up tools. I experience some difficulties with them, and can't use them. The conflict with something in Windows. Also, there is a duplicate file locator, but you should inspect VERY carefully before you remove any. Overall, it's an awesome program."

14838,1,"Toontrack's EZ Drummer is a lifesaver, ideal for those who write their own songs, but don't have access to a real drum kit.After install, I was up and running and ready to add some decent sounding drum tracks to my songs. Very easy drag and drop format and plenty of grooves to choose from. You can create a song anywhere from rock, pop, punk, and more, or you can even create beats yourself. Works great with Sony Acid Music Studio for me.It took me no time to create my first song. After a couple of hours recording some guitar and bass tracks, I just had to fill in the blanks with EZdrummer. It took me no more than five hours to have a decent sounding demo to share with friends (and that's with multiple guitar/bass takes, rehearsing, mixing, and more..)As other reviewers have commented, there are a fairly limited number of drums and cymbals to choose from, but to get the full effect of the product, purchasing an expansion pack is highly recommended.Set up is easy enough - however, you do need to register the product before use. Easy enough, and it only takes a minute. Just copy a couple of codes and fill out some contact info and you'll be good to go.A great product at a FANTASTIC price on Amazon, and an especially great deal on shipping with Prime."

It has a panoramic maker, that really does work very well! Again, I used to stitch together all the photos and then have to blend, etc. Now, the touch of a button and voila, I have a panoramic. I am impressed with every aspect of this software and would highly recommend it. It makes a great pal to PSP also."
21592,1,"StuffIt's a great product, read the computer magazine reviews to see why they think so too, and its pretty much the only PC compressor that opens PC, Mac and Linux files too, and the easiest to use once you *unlearn* the klugie way you've been trained to compress or expand files on Windows over the years with other products, its like unlearning an old golf swing. Why didn't someone think of drag and drop compression and expanding before this? StuffIt handles nearly any format right on the Windows desktop, you get encryption with it, you can make self expanding archives at no extra cost, plus you get the very cool StuffIt Express program with it to automate other file related tasks too, so you don't have to do the same thing over and over again (like making the same mistake), and you just can't beat the price either. Bottom line, if you get files from folks on other platforms or want to do it the easy way, StuffIt is the only one to get, period."

On top of this box is a price tag than nobody can refuse.All these applications have been carefully bugs cleaned, and this version is the most stable and faster ever produced by Corel Corporation. Corel is known for offers several new tools in each new version, but this time they have been concentrated in cleaning and stabilizing these applications, and as a result they have come out with the best version ever.Last weekend four product managers form a world wide corporation asked me to design eighteen flyers for them.

Photo Paint helps to process almost three hundred photographs from negative film, and preprinted catalogs. Do I see crashes, the famous CARM, or slow down of these applications? The answer is ""NOT.""There are few excellent new tools, but there are not the most important parts in this new version.

Window Washer was listed as the second best privacy software by TopTenReviews after the much more expensive Evidence Eliminator.When I first ran Window Washer it seemed to do a very good job of erasing various extraneous information and freed up nearly 1 GB of space on my hard drive.

In Window Washer go to Options, then Program Settings, then UNCHECK ""Automatically set Window Washer fonts to Microsoft Clear Type"".There are some online discussion forums that claim that the Window Washer ""Bleach"" function doesn't always work. I haven't tried it so I don't know about that.Overall this program seems to do a good cleaning job and is fairly easy to use.Update: Caution- when I used the ""Clean free space"" option, I could no longer connect with the Internet.

46102,1,"This software does most of what Photoshop does, but at a much lower price and is easier to use. This includes adjusting lighting, contrast, color, sharpness, and fixing red-eye. It has Levels and layers just like Photoshop, and a lot of painting/drawing tools. You can burn-in and dodge, and apply changes to just the selected portions of an image. You can adjust the layer &quot;mask&quot;, adding and removing effects to portions of the image even after you create an adjustment layer. It can be a little intimidating at first because of the power of such things as layers, but the wealth of improvements you can make to your photos is amazing. You CAN print multiple pictures on a page, in multiple formats at once, despite what &quot;Disappointed&quot; said. You can also construct a set of web pages to display your work using a powerful wizard. The manual isn't bad, but provides little guidance on when to use various corrections, so a good book on this software is recommended."

They automatically update their alter whenever I hotsink. I carry books I've downloaded in Word or PDF format, and I have used it to download photos onto my PDA. And all without one glitch in 1 year!"

94379,1,"This software works so well it (almost) makes preparing tax returns enjoyable. I've used it for a few years now, and couldn't imagine going back to filling in the forms with a pencil and calculator. It is very reassuring to know that you're not making any math errors or mistakes on multi form returns when you're transferring balances from one form to another or comparing percentages.Now they're working on electronic downloads of information from many financial institutions and mutual fund companies. That hasn't worked yet for me, but it's no problem entering the figures into the prompts when the documents come in the mail.After you use this software the first year, it will bring in your personal data, business information, bank accounts, and other fixed data from the previous year's return; another big time saver. It's January 11th now and I already have a significant portion of my return completed - amazing!My only complaint is a small one with the company, in that they keep telemarketing me to buy annual upgrades direct from them. The price for this is about the same as buying the full product with the rebate, so I see this as a cheap way to steal or take over the customers and sell direct, and I pretty much tell them that when they call and continue to buy every year through Amazon."

25918,1,"Ghost2003 is great(!)- the newest Ghost9 can be bought separately & integrated: highly recommended!A listing of my favorite features-1.AntiVirus-(10/10) I love it! Best. AntiVirus. Ever.2.Speed Disk-(9/10) I love it! Defragmentation in a Symantec style.3.Disk Doctor-(9/10) I love it! Windows CHKDSK in a Symantec style.4.Wipe Info-(9/10) great file deletion. Permanently destroys individual files, yet NOT free space on NTFS disks.5.Ghost 2003-(10/10) awesome as usual. Newest Ghost9 is even better! Great with RAID 0- Ghost9 is speedier.6.No Activation-(10/10) sounds strange, but these days the lack of activation= a very nice feature!7.Quick Clean-(8/10) I like it; I created a shortcut to WCQUICK.EXE & frequently use it.8.UnErase Wizard-(7/10) I like it; rarely need it. Extra protection from file deletion.9.Process Viewer-(7/10) I like it; rarely need it. Windows Process Viewer/Manager.10.WinDoctor-(6/10) semi-controversial. People say it ruins Windows(!). I mainly use it for analysis.Bottom Line- Amazingly, even today 2003Pro is Symantec's best. I've had great success using it with ZoneAlarm, Spybot, and PartitionMagic 8.0. Ghost9 can be obtained individually and integrated. You're BEST value-for-money can be had by purchasing the Norton Ghost 9.0 & Partition Magic 8.0 Bundle. As far as 2005Premier is concerned: Get SystemWorks2003Pro instead! It has a better look, no product activation, is every bit as capable, and is EXCEEDINGLY cost-effective right now: it's still available if you're willing to search for it! Get it today!"
75896,1,"After using this product for a couple of weeks I am happy enough with it. I am actually looking to create my own 3d projects from my drawings and this program is for posing premade objects. Basically this is a dress up doll program, which can be fun and useful. I like the program and it works really great for what it is and once I can create my own objects, I will use them with Poser. There are a lot of objects to buy and get for free to play around with. I'm not unhappy I bought it."
58408,1,I have used this program for five years and just love it. I am starting book 12 of scrapbooks that I have made using it. It is easy to use and to manuplate. I have found that the program will slow down when using high res pictures but medium res pictures trun out great on my ink jet. Make sure you use the right paper for you printer. This makes a huge difference. I love this program so much I have given ten othe people this as gifts.

It's amazing how a company that produces such buggy products already has me waiting for their next one... how DO they do it? To give a few more details, I experience one or two crashes a day, 90% of which are from microsoft programs (Outlook Express, Internet Explorer, Word, PowerPoint) Oh, and the 5/5 rating was just to stand out from the crowd -- I hope I didn't raise the overall rating too much."
39976,1,I like this product a lot. I bought it as a gift for a relative who just started his own church. I have a more advance version and have been using PC Study Bible products since they first came out. The software is pretty easy to use. The one problem I have with this particular version is that it doesn't include the NIV translation. I find that to be strange sense the NIV is one of the most popular translations. You can get the NIV translation in a more expensive version of PC Study Bible which seems to be a way for the company to get more money out of users. You can also buy an add-on that only includes the NIV translation. Great product but be sure to look at all the details before purchasing.

22425,1,"i really liked the idea of all of the asian languages in this packet. and the games are very fun and helpful, and you can hear how things are ""supposed"" to be pronounced as well. its a great way to learn i feel.the only negative thing i would have to say about this program, was that none of the ""talk now"" cds worked on my computer for some reason, all the others did though ((i have a windows vista)). and it shows how things would be ""written"" in that language, and in romanized form to help you to know how to pronounce it, which is really great, but i wish there was something to help you learn the alphabet/the pronunciations for one letter."
82531,0,"This a nice, low cost GPS unit to hook up to your laptop with the distinct advantage of being fully USB powered, but be wary of the confusing interface of the Street Atlas USA 2003 mapping software. I wash rather shocked when I installed it, as it was a throwback to pre windows 98 style buttons. Anyone used to the ease of use of MS streets and trips will be frustrated by this package. However, the software is actually very comprehensive once you figure out how to use it. I think Delorme should focus on real UI enhancements instead of throwing in some very weak voice command tools that will not work for 90% of people in 90% of situations. Sorry, but the substandard interface gets two snaps down."

90165,1,"I started using Access 2 in 1992. Before that I used DBASE, RBASE and Paradox. I didn't like Access and thought that RBASE was the best of the 4. However, as things go, Microsoft won and the others are dead, either entirely or mostly. So, I decided to stick with Access and have for the past 15 years.Access is a good tool for many things and 2007 is a definate upgrade to 2002. However, getting used to it is a little bit of a challenge.I've used access as a stand alone product or as a front-end to a DBMS like SQL Server so I could get a significant performance boost out of it.I use it to manipulate data for data quality issues and for data exploration and dup checking. And, it works great.I've also created some pretty complex and cost effective application with it over the years with lots of positive results."
43078,1,I have been very happy with this product. I have needed it for a while because the whole University has switched over. I really like OneNote for notes in class. Overall I am very pleased.
36799,0,"Installed easily and automatically began full system backup. After backup was complete , the software prompted to test the boot devices (diskettes and CDs) and media (CDs).The media that had just been completed and &quot;assured good&quot; was not readable. In addition , the backup software corrupted a number of boot files on the hard drive backed up rendering the system non-bootable.Customer support was reluctant with most time spent explaining that the product &quot;couldn't have done the damage&quot;. Product support was NOT extrodinarily knowledgable , but was responsive. Eventually , all corrupted boot files were identified although corrective procedures did not work. I finally worked through the problems with OS manuals and old backups ( non Backup Exec ).In the end , an incompatibilty with installed software on my system that was not documented in the readme files caused the problems . This software &quot;Adaptec's Direct CD&quot; needs to be disabled when using Backup Exec.I now have backups that are &quot;tested&quot; good but have little confidence. I would not recommend this product for the novice."
6791,1,"When I first downloaded this program onto my computer, I felt overwhelmed. The directions were not clear and there were so many areas to explore, I didn't know where to begin. However, as I began to learn how to work the program I found it to be an extremely useful tool to learn Portuguese. Not only can I practice my pronunciation of Portuguese words, but I can also close my eyes and listen to a native speaker to test my listening comprehension. Also, I can play a game to pratice my language skills as well! If you are serious about learning Portuguese I highly recommend you purchase this program. Yes, it's confusing in the beginning. . . however as time passes you will find it one of your most useful means to learn the language. I enjoy using the program and although I've owned it now for 5 months, I still have many areas to explore on the CD. However, keep in mind if you are a serious student of Portuguese this program is not the only tool you will need to learn the language. I recommend buying a great dictionary and grammar book to understand how the language works (this CD has hints about Portuguese grammar, but does not explain it in detail). If you purchase the books and the program, you will learn portuguese without a tutor or teacher! I'm already testing my language skills by reading articles on Portuguese websites. Thanks to this program, other tools, and my weekly (almost daily) study habits I can understand much of what I read!"
91678,1,"My five year old had played JumpStart games in the past so we got this for him for Christmas. It really makes learning contagious as it's so much fun he doesn't even realize he's learning new things as he goes.One small warning, however. This game only provides the first couple modules of content. After that JumpStart hits you up for a subscription or a lump sum payment for the additional content. Once your child starts playing the game it's pretty hard to stop and not pay for the expansions."
26724,1,"Works fairly well, easy to use fairly accurate. But like all programs of the same type, and GPS products, it is 2 -3 years out of date by the time it hits the shelf. As long as you Take that into account, it will get you in close proximity to where you are going."
48278,1,I have used several other printing programs and found the Mackiev &#34;Print Shop 2&#34; very easy to navigate through. The user guide was very detailed in the use of the program and very helpful in manipulating the various menu options. I especially like the &#34;scrapbook&#34; feature to save images that I use frequently. Very nice!
18372,1,"For anyone who knows me, it's no secret that I would love to be a screenwriter. Will that dream ever happen? Who knows, but until it does I'm content to practice what I feel is my true gift, reviewing. But while I'm honing my craft as a reviewer, hoping to be published one day, I still like to work on my other dreams, like screenwriting (and stand-up comedy).That's where this program comes in handy. I type in my characters and locations, and it helps me input them automatically, saving loads of time while I write. In fact, the software is so easy to use, I completed two screenplays within a week of owning it: ""The Next Karate Kid, Part II"", and ""Stardrivers"", which is about an intergalactic space race to the sun. I'm now working on a Howdy Doody feature film, an action film called ""Bloodthirsty"" that I think could be Scott Baio's ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Stardrivers 2"". It's helped me realize that I really am a truly gifted writer, and that everyone who has doubted my abilities was just a hurdle on my way to success.Are there any flaws in the program? Well, it's a little disappointing that the software doesn't come with any screenplay ideas built in, to help with the writer's block that occasionally sets in. But for us creative types, I guess that's not needed - we've always got new and fresh ideas! This software is not for everyone, though - for the vast majority of you reading this, you'll never see a screenplay published, so perhaps you should consider another hobby or long-term project. This type of thing is mainly for those of us who truly have a future in the business, not the pretenders."

It has shots of just about every part of Yellowstone I wanted to see. And, while the footage is old, none of the features of Yellowstone have changed in thousands of years, so its not a big deal.The qulaity of the footage is top rate and it didn't cost me a fortune, so I'm happy with it."
44616,0,"In my opinion, this is not as horrific as people are making it out to be. (Caveat: although I am an experienced Word user, I do not use it for ""professional"" purposes, just the basics).Yes, there was an initial learning curve (At first I could be heard muttering ""how the &*@$# do I SAVE my document?"") but once I figured out the little Microsoft logo I was good to go.One improvement I noticed: the equation editor is fantastic. Equations were an area where previous versions of Word were absolutely, utterly, and completely pitiful. In fact, when I was in economics graduate school in 2005, professors routinely used LateX for documents because of the equation editing (and LateX is a formatting language, basically out of the 1970s). The equation editor in Word 2007 is really slick! If there's any justice in this world, LateX should finally be dead."
6046,1,"Internet Security does everything you could possibly need (all of it in the background)to keep your data safe. My only complaints are the irritating messages that pop up on the screen when my outbound mail is scanned for viruses (the message blocks whatever I am doing for about 5 seconds, interrupting my work) and the lack of detail on attacks on my computer.If you don't own any firewall or anti-virus protection, get something. This product works great and is XP compatible. I especially like being able to enter &quot;private&quot; data such as my e-mail address or SSN. IS will let you know if a web site you are visiting is actually getting this data from your computer. I discovered that DELL Computer was getting my e-mail address from my computer without permission when I visited their site.I feel very comfortable leaving my computer connected to the internet 24/7 with this application running."

1783,1,"The new sensor acquires satellites more quickly, and the software provides more accurate solutions, compared to previous versions.My big problem is the extent of the database of locations. My family is interested in National Parks, National Forests, etc (a good deal for the taxpayers, in my eyes), but these are not available. When I wanted directions to the Manassas battlefield, I could only get directions to the town. The map shows something north of the town, but it is not well identified.A solution would be to provide the ability for me to add a category (Lebanese restaurants, anyone?), and to add records. Push pins aren't quite up to the task.Otherwise, I found the product really helpful, with a good interface."
47039,1,"I was told that the huey is an expensive color calibration tool to use for calibrating a monitor and also a very good one. Since I didn't want to invest a lot of money in a calibrator at this time, I purchased the huey. So far it has done very well. I need it in order to see the correct color of my photos before printing them or sending them over the web. I think it was a good purchase."
88619,0,"I bought this software when my son was around 18mnths old. He is a total Thomas fan so he is always asking to play it. He loves to sit and watch Thomas and his friends travel around the island of sodor. He is currently 2yrs old and wants to play it every day. It really is a great piece to have my only complaint would be that he is now starting to get bored with the activities. It doesn't allow children who can not use the mouse to interact with it's games , which is important to keep them content. It also doesn't give you much else to do once you've mastered the five step program. It's the pictures, sound and graphics that keeps them coming back not the content and tools to learning. I would still recommend it don't be too disappointed. It would be nice if they came out with a game that the children could actually drive the train and interact with it choosing what destination to go to as well as being able to stop, start, pull forward and back up the train. something to think about."
47119,1,I read many reviews before deciding which product to purchase for monitor calibration.Before starting the calibration process I checked for product updates and found that one existed. The software update was a cinch.I'm pleased with the simplicity of this product and the results I've seen on my LCD monitor and my laptop display.If you're searching for a monitor calibration hardware/software product I'd strongly suggest looking at the Pantone Eye-One Display2.
91232,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."
52577,1,I have been using Quicken for many years and now Money has easily beat out Quicken. The conversion of my Quicken data was seamless and the Microsoft support was without question the greatest I have received from any vendor. Of course this is easy since Intuit's support has continued to go down hill with almost all support/question calls now billable for both their home and professional products. Money has added support for equity/index options something I have asked Intuit to do for 5 years without success. Lastly Microsoft's suite package continues to provide more value to the consumer while Intuit has eliminated their suite (including TurboTax) in order to obtain greater sales.

49286,0,"I just upgraded to Vista Home Premium addition. The upgrade process actually went pretty smooth. It was afterwards that I had issues. It is amazing to me that so many software venders have not updated their software to work with Vista after Vista was 5 years in the making and then delayed their release date! I had to spend $250 for a memory upgrade, I had to buy a new ethernet card because linksys had not written a driver for Vista, and I get constant popups from Vista saying that Norten Antivirus software is not compatible, I also get other error messages relating to HP software for my printer. I have spent 2 full days haseling with these problems. And honestly, the look and functionaliy is not much different from Windows XP. The real difference is in the security area. It really makes you think about the new Mac TV commericals having a point."

I find it harder and more time consuming to use than earlier versions. This, of course, is a personal opinion, and I'm sure others love it. All in all, this was a very good purchase at Amazon as the same product costs at least twice as much elsewhere, including Costco!!"

10993,1,"I purchased this program to make backup copies of certain DVDs in my home collection so that my kids could watch and handle the copies without damaging the originals. This program worked wonderfully and I later purchased the upgrade to version 8. One of the things I didn't like about it was that you couldn't deselect certain portions of the DVD that you didn't want copies but I found a patch on the internet that solved that problem. Another thing I didn't like was that sometimes the file size would be too big or smaller than it needed to be. But overall, this program was well worth the purchase - I wish Pinnacle hadn't stopped making it."
9748,0,"I have seen a lot of Game-to-movie ideas. And so far, this is the only one that holds water. Some rag on it for the simple fact that it's Mortal Kombat. And that may be a valid point... but just how deep can you make a movie based on a fighting game? Give it credit, it's the ONLY &quot;game-movie&quot; that's moderately interesting... the sequel induces fits of nausea and insanity. We think Paul Anderson should have quit while he was ahead. The sequel was a prime example of &quot;milking a franchise.&quot; Avoid it like the plague, and watch the Mortal Kombat movie that was actually worth a damn... the first one."
860,0,"I purchased this program at the store mostly because the version I bought came with a MIDI USB interface. Once installed it ran fine on my Windows XP machine, but it just had a little AVI movie screen. After upgrading my machine to Windows Vista the program installed, the MIDI interface installed but all videos that came with the product stopped working.According to the website not all movies will play on Vista and then they informed you that no remedy will be made. Long story short, if you have Vista find another product."

39738,0,"The short of this review is that Norton Ghost 9.0 worked to restore a failed drive, but after about 12 hours of work and ONLY because I made a network copy of the backup as a drive was failing. That's the good news, here's the bad.1) Many drive image recovery features are sloppily implemented with little explanation of the parameters needed and little tolerance for users selecting the wrong one.2) The recovery program NEVER recognized the files on my second drive that's only reason for existing was to hold Ghost backup drive images.3) It also failed to map and recognize shared folders on a networked PC that stored the backup drive images until a password was added to the Administrator account on that PC (no documentation of this).4) It failed to indicate that it recognized a new unformatted replacement disc until the final stage of the restoration process, giving the appearance that there was no point in starting the process.5) It didn't advise when to select ""restore BOOT.INI"". I had to learn how to edit it after I restored it in order to get the PC to boot.6) It required many reboots of the recovery program to understand and complete the recovery process, and reboot are very slow - taking about 10 minutes.7) It's exceptionally slow reading a mapped network drive or browsing folders in a backup stored on a network drive, taking perhaps 20 minutes or longer for each change of folders.There are reports that the way Ghost makes a backup drive image of the Windows drive while in Windows is an inherently an undependable process and that it will fail a percent of the time.Perhaps I got lucky because Ghost was able to restore my drive after 12 hours resolving the above. I read that the older v3/2003 version of Ghost, which comes bundled with v9/2005 version is more dependable, even for XP. Also, Acronis True Image 8 is said to be good. I'll probably try Ghost v3 now (since I have it) and try Acronis True Image if it looks like it has problems. Ghost v9 was scary!"

It made the GPS more useable for the street."

85062,1,"This is a strong update. Since Adobe bought Macromedia, DW works best with their products. Powerful, nicely laid out, and fairly intuitive, but I wish it had a manual. Had to buy a ""Missing Manual"" book, which I highly recommend as an auxiliary reference.Overall, DW retains its title as king (or queen) of web development software."
63383,0,"Final Cut Express is a very powerful program, and no doubt you can make spectacular movies with it. However, there is one glaring flaw that is driving me nuts: NO BATCH CAPTURE! In Final Cut Pro, the much more expensive parent of Final Cut Express, you can run through your video setting in/out points very quickly, and then simply doing a ""Batch Capture,"" allowing you to walk away and let the program gather all your clips. In FCE, however, it's different. You can either capture the whole tape, and then edit it later. Or, you can set your in/outs, and then capture before moving on to the next clip. My God, if you have a lot of video to work with, can you imagine how much extra time this will take. And, again, with a lot of video, unless you have massive amounts of storage, it is going to be tough to capture an entire tape and cut it up later.So, don't get me wrong.....great program, tons of tools, tremdendous value for the money. BUT, Batch Capturing is a must for me. This program would have been a solid 5 stars had Apple simply included batch capturing. For me, my projects are long enough to where I have to have it. So......I am buying Final Cut Studio (not only for batch capturing, but for the additional codecs as well).If your goal is to take your home movies to the next level and have far more features than iMovie, and the capturing issues are not a big deal for you (or you are on a strict budget), then this may be the program for you."

I originally installed this on my Win98 platform with no problems, and continue to have no problems now that I have upgraded my system to XP. This has saved me from having several damaging viruses downloaded."

Shoa Kahn and Shang Tsung are trying to invade Earth but they can't do so without winning 10 straight victories in the tournament of Mortal Kombat and the lead characters Rayden, Liu Kang, Sonya, and Johnny Cage think they can do it. But they'll have to face the toughest opponents from the first two games: Goro, Sub-Zero, Kano, Scorpion, and Reptile. A little short on characterization but the special effects and action sequences make up for almost every individual short coming nicely. Only for fans of the original games. Tops the prior STREET FIGHTER movie like it doesn't exist."
23243,0,"The software is pretty good, and it's price is not unreasonable, but I am giving it 3 stars for the lack of an actual upgrade path (i.e. not paying full price every year for an upgrade). To me that seems not to be customer-friendly for those of us who need to keep current with QuickBooks Pro.In addition, they need to find a way to make their patch/update process run more quickly. Regardless of the time of day it seems to be one of the slowest downloads that I know of (compare to MS, Firefox, Logitech, and Symantec for example)."
73687,1,I truly enjoy this game. The people look so agitated when they are waiting for their food. The animation is outstanding and it is worth every penny.
82599,1,"I'm not sure what the point of this review is seeing as Adobe are pulling this version as CS4 is now out, but I guess I'm writing this because I just want to show some love for one of my favourite toys.Allow me to inaccurately paraphrase someone well known once describing After Effects as 'the single most important tool in filmmaking since the invention of the camera'. Which I remember reading in Stu Maschowitz's 'DV Rebels Guide to Making Killer Action Movies on the Cheap' Which probably not the exact title either.If you use this already, then you know the deal. If you're new to the world of special effects / animation / motion graphics, then let me recommend this tool to you, as it's not only relatively easy to use, but the possibilities from it are limited only by your imagination (and budget! if you're a filmmaker).It's about as awesome as a post-production tool gets. If you look at the price tag compared to what it allows you to do, when you put it on a fast computer (or render farm) then it's the bargain of the century."
34277,1,"when that system died I bought a new HP laptop running WinXP Media Center.

63025,1,"When OS 10.4 was released much was expected by the consumer and OS 10.4 delivered. Not that it was the perfect release as it was followed up with upgrades but the first release was solid. Stable and easy to use, after installation I found no problems on my mac. And even more so enjoyed the new features that it offers. 10.4 is the final version that can be run on most G3 macs. It will be in demand as consumers look to upgrade their G3s. Many chose not to upgrade when it was released but for different reasons want to move up now. It's solid, dependable and can be upgraded to 10.4.11 for free from Apple's web site."
67249,1,"I don't know what we were waiting for (except maybe to give Intuit more time to work the bugs out). We purchased the Contractor's edition of 2007, and the changes over 2004 are very good. I've also used 2006, and like this edition even better. Instead of having to switch between pages, everything you need is on the home screen, which you can customize to your own liking. (I still need to work on that some more.) That makes this edition much more user-friendly.The upgrade was seamless -- so much so, in fact, that I inherited all of the messy stuff created by previous bookkeepers. I had a little inside help from my brother, who works for Intuit. I'm enjoying learning all of the possibilities for integrating all of my tasks (tracking expenses for various projects separately in Excel will hopefully go by the wayside soon!).Thanks, Intuit, for a great product! And of course, Amazon's customer service was awesome as always!"
40440,1,"This is a great DVD. I have been playing, uh, less than one week! Okay, that doesn't make me an expert. Then, again, it does make me an ""authority"" on beginning drum videos (as compared to trainging videos of all other sorts). This video is the best of about five that I have tried. I believe it has been superceded by ""Getting Started on Drums"", which I also plan to try, also by Tommy Igoe (many more reviews there). This is good stuff."

58628,0,"I was able to work through the all the hoops to unlock the software, get it loaded and then downloaded to my GPS. Its fine and certainly worth the price given the additional function it adds to the Garmin units that have GPSMAPPING like the 60CX. However, is it really necessary to provide soom much security around this software to limit how you load it once you buy it at a price that already should provide a fair rate of return to the manufacturer? The results of the software, 5 stars, the loading experience thins to three, but I would recommend it."

14207,1,"I'm running a Dell inspiron 6000 1.4 Ghz Processor with 512 MB RAM. The only time the program runs buggy is if I have 10 things going on at once. but that's because I have way too much crap on my computer. I've actually run this and Hip Hop 5 at the same time with no problems at all. All in all it's a pretty good program. Not sure how the recording studio is as I've never used it, but if you have Dance 5 and Techno 4 you can use those sounds in this program giving you a very good variety of sounds. The beat maker is pretty good, Hip Hop 5's has better sounding drums, but I like my drums to sound more real than not. Too bad you can't use more than one drum track that you've created in the groove maker without saving it as a wav. Unless I just haven't figured that part out yet. Check out myspace.com/thelostdivision the tracks on there were all made through Dance 6 with all of the samples from Techno 4 and Dance 5."

I've been listening to iTunes through my iMuffs wireless headphones for the last couple hours and I couldn't be happier. The sound quality is fantastic and I don't have that stupid cord tethering me to the laptop. I know it sounds like a small thing, but trust me, once you go wireless you won't go back!Also also psyched about the new Mail app and it's integration with notes and to-dos although I'm sure it'll take a while to transition my current lists to the new way of working."

26482,0,"My son loves Putt Putt. He has ""Putt Putt Saves the Zoo"", ""Putt Putt Travels Through Time"" and ""Putt Putt Enters The Race""....all great games. Saves the Zoo is the only one where the game doesn't change each time you play it, but it's still a good game. I bought ""Putt Putt Goes to the Moon"" for my son for Christmas. We inserted the disc and got the game going. Well, as soon as he saw the graphics, he didn't like it. Pep looks totally different, and everything is cheap looking compared to the other Putt Putt games. If you never bought a Putt Putt game for your child, then this one should be fine. But if he or she already has Putt Putt games (or any of the other Humungous games like Freddi Fish or Pajama Sam, both I highly recommend byy the way), it will be hard for them to get past the difference in graphics. I even love playing these games with my child, but I can understand why it's not even appealing. I'm sure the game itself is great, as they all are, but I can't get past the graphics to even give this game a chance. I'm not going to give it only one star, though, because it probably is a good game in spite of it's appearance."

67805,1,"I only started to use Linux (starting with Red Hat 8.1) in May of 2003, but as of writing this in the following July, I can say that I was hooked from day one. The latest Mac commercials say that &quot;Anything you can do on a PC, you can do on a Mac. And more.&quot; Add another more for Red Hat Linux.Integration with Windows XP is absolutely seamless. Because MS likes wiping out your hard drive's master boot record, it is necessary to partition using the XP installation disk first for three partitions. One will be NTFS for the XP install. Second will be a FAT32 partition, considering that Linux can't write to NTFS. The third will be simply blank, that will go to your Linux partitions. Once the XP install is done, you can install Linux by using Disk Druid (included in the installation disks) to split the third partition into what you need (ext3, swap, etc.). Tell the guy who says that fdisk won't work with XP that he's right and wrong. It won't work, and you don't need it.Red Hat comes with all the programs you need. OpenOffice.org handles just about any MS Office file with ease. If you've ever used any web browser, Mozilla doesn't even need to be learned. GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is far better than anything when prices are compared. It does everything that a Paint Shop Pro-level program would do for FREE. Quanta Plus for KDE is equal to or better than Macromedia HomeSite.Best of all, Linux in itself is a stable and secure open-source operating system. All programs have bugs, and Linux programs are no exception. Regardless, you won't find yourself restarting three times daily because of the blue screen of death. In fact, I highly suggest using the included &quot;BSOD&quot; screen saver to laugh at your former agony. Open source also means that you have the entire Linux community at your hands if anything ever goes wrong, rather than just a few-hundred overpaid Microsoft programmers. Somebody once said, &quot;If you want your words read, write error messages for Microsoft.&quot;I've only found two real problems. The first is that Red Hat doesn't include support for MPEG video or MP3 compression, notwithstanding that it's way too easy to simply download programs that will play such files. Second is the current lack of games available for Linux. Even I run Windows, but it's only for nothing more than games. As far as drivers are concerned, the only big problems you'll find are on network controllers, software-controlled modems, and certain brands of printers. Epson and HP have the best track record in this respect, and LinuxPrinting.org rates the Epson Stylus C82 as the best Linux printer out there. NONE of these problems deserve me docking a star off a 5-star rating.Linux has already sliced up a huge share of Microsoft's hold on the server market, and within the next five to ten years many expect it to start accelerating its pace at the home and business market. The open source revolution is only getting started. Microsoft's claims to fame with Windows Server 2003's security can be easily read as a huge desperation move. They're about to lose, and they know it. Home users are next.Jump on the bandwagon, everyone! If the Internet was a revolution, the next one is Linux. Don't listen to the naysayers; you'll never regret spending just forty bucks on this. I know I didn't."

The plug and play of everything is simply astounding. I am very impressed. It was worth the upgrade. Outstanding."

But, the problems are just too numerous to recommend, in my opinion. Mandrake tries to be a little too bleeding edge, and when I was testing 8.2, I had some issues that I could not resolve. On the other hand, SuSE 8.0 ran out of the box for me on both my home-built desktop and my Dell laptop. Absolutely no major issues on either machine.The other thing is that Mandrake is now releasing 9.0 beta to its testers. I don't understand Mandrake's accelerated release schedule. 8.2 just appeared in stores and they're already working on 9.0. Go figure.Anyway, keep an eye on Mandrake, they are a nice company and put out a nice distribution. I would just look elsewhere for now."

Further, I was amazed when using the SW in Grand Canyon National Park that the Forest Service roads to Point Sublime did not show up on the TOPO map. Basically, TOPO US 2008 is a marginal tool for use as a laptop SW Navigation system.That said, its ability to organize, select and transfer maps to a portable GPS unit (I use a GPSMAP 76CS) is commendable. It also supports full USB interface to the GPS unit (even USB of the NMEA data that used to require a serial cable).I use several GPS SWS packages including Natl Geographic TOPO!, Delorme TOPO, and Microsoft Streets and Trips. I'm not satisfied with any of them yet. The Garmin SW however is necessary as it is the only SW that will load maps onto my Garmin Receiver."

17367,1,"So far I have had a pretty easy time with OneCare. After reading other reviews, I learned that you should uninstall any other Security you have on your system. I was more than happy to get rid of McAfee. After this, the installation was very easy. It directed you to download Defender, so I am not sure what the problem was with one of the other reviewers. I didn't have to do any extra work to have that on the computer, just push a button when prompted. I also personally haven't had any rebooting problems with my PC. One problem/issue I have had has been touched upon in other reviews. The firewall system seems to be a little flawed. It will tell you that a program is ""allowed,"" such as Windows Media Connect, but then it won't actually allow it. I had to go in and manually allow different aspects of media connect, it wasn't good enough to say that the whole program was allowed. I found this particularly strange since it is a microsoft program made for the Xbox 360, which is a microsoft system. Strange. So now I know to keep my eye out for this particular situation in the future. Anyway, other than that, I have had a pretty easy time with OneCare. I would recommend it to anyone."

Mainly being the use of other antivirus programs with Norton Internet Suite 2007.Previously, I was using 2006 Norton Internet Security Suite with Spybot S&D.;So BEFORE my install of 2007 Norton I removed Spybot S&D; to a USB flash drive. Next I installed 2007 Norton and followed the on screen prompts to completion. Once the Live Update and a complete system scan had been completed, I reinserted Spybot S&D; to my program files and have had ZERO problems. No system slowdown, slow reboots, or Norton ""virus like activities"" (read that one in a report). It acts the same as it ever had, but it did manage to find a tracking cookie that the 2006 Norton never found.Don't be afraid of this one!"

I learned a great deal of Portuguese in a short period of time with this software. The conversation practices were my favorite part because I was able to learn many phrases and things to say in various different situations such as ordering dinner at a restuarant or asking for directions (this was very useful on my trip). I also really liked the video and audio features which were superb in every way.

There is the option to use either a mouse or keyboard, which he'll switch back and forth. This is a lot of fun and there are several types of learning games. Sometimes we play it together or I just let him sit and play the games himself. I can't believe I can just walk away and the software will know when to move on to the next scene automatically. This is absolutely incredible."

94854,0,"Should you upgrade? Well, kind of, I tend always upgrade to the latest from Symantec. For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to ""Norton Anti-virus 2005"", the programs from Symantec such as System Works and Utilities are just the same, no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and the obvious bloat of it. Doesn't even include features your getting for free in Windows like a FireWall, which comes free with SP2 for Windows XP. The introduction of technology such as Activation was not smooth, and caused a lot of headaches which only makes the product less embracing than it use to be.Symantec needs focus on areas such as Speed, Seamless Integration with Windows, obviously it has lost it. My next purchase from Symantec won't be in the retail line, but from Enterprise space. The Corporate Edition of Norton Antivirus, it offers all the tools I want for protecting my PC, yes it cost a lot and its targetted towards the Large Networks, but it is so subtle and easy to use and it does not bog down your PC.So, should you upgrade?If recently purchased System Works 2004 or Norton 2004 or any of the Symantec line of products at least wait until your one year subscription is up. Because that's what you buy a utility program for, to keep updated against the latest attacks."

The tutorial is not too bad but it's not great in the fact it doesn't exactly tell you what to do after you finish a certain step. I had to actually use the Help file a few times to accomplish a few tasks, but with a little time and patients I was able to accomplish exactly what I wanted to do with my movie.You can edit and add text,titles, sound effects, music, and transitions to your home movies. I'm not sure if there is anything you can't do with this program. Burn it to DVD or save it as a HD video file or a Smaller file that you can email. Once installed, I recommend updating to the latest version as this will fix a few bugs and add some needed DVD widescreen options. I'm very satisfied with this program."
28245,1,"that is what I was told .. and it was true. I do use the Gold Edition of both 4.0d and the new 5.0 versions with WinXP and I have zero problems. The most unique feature of TMG is that it will allow you to chronologically record ANY piece of information ... it does not take a program modification to create a new field as TMG is 'event' oriented, therefore, any event can be recorded in full with date, location, all individuals who were present at the event, individual notes and even will allow you to create a different sentence structure to be output to narrative reports. Some people think TMG is more difficult to learn but it is only because we are used to having a special field for each item .. this is truly the most flexible genealogy software available. I have used PAF, Brother's Keeper, Family Tree Maker, Roots .. and a couple I don't even remember. I would NEVER leave TMG .. it just gives me everything I need .. and has definitely made me a better genealogist."
85242,0,"Petz 5 is a great game, but I have still yet to find out if it was worth the money. My favorite feature in it is the multiple litters, but the process of raising the kids is quite a chore. Only the mom and her babies can be out, and they can only be in the Nursery playscene (not accessible from the go menu). When they grow up, you are taken to the Nursery, but then you have to go to a different playscene and then take them out. Annoying. Also, the new breeds are less than satisfying. Their offspring often have weird colorings, nothing like their own. Also, I hate the fact that it runs slow on my computer (more a problem for me because my computer only meets the minimum requirements). By the way, you don't need the CD to run it, like some people have stated. And if you look up on the internet, you can find a patch to get all the toys possible. ... Honestly, I think Petz 3 was the best game out of the whole series. So, if you have never had any Petz games before, get Petz 3 instead."

57233,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

21129,1,"After experiencing a couple of technical issues with my computers over the last three years, I've used just about all the antispyware software on the market. Pest Patrol, Spybot, Ad-Aware, Zero Spyware, even the one Microsoft makes, Spyware beta, as well as the ones provided in the security suites (none of which are that good), and Spy Sweeper is by far the best antispyware product today. It catches spyware that the others will periodically miss and then some. Better yet, it is more user friendly than the others, especially Pest Patrol (whose new licensing validation that is employed every time you initiate the program can be a hassle). In fact, Spy Sweeper 4.5 is one of those rare antispyware programs that actually functions better now than its earlier versions. The descent of some of the other antispyware versions (Pest Patrol since its buyout by the folks at CA), like its counterparts amongst the antivirus/security suite software (i.e., Norton), should be disconcerting enough, but if you're looking for software that can operate either as an excellent backup for a security suite or as your primary antispyware program, Spy Sweeper is an excellent choice."
25990,0,"Summary: Adequate for armchair map browsing and finding and planning routes to follow when driving or hiking.I've only been playing with the program for about a week, but decided to get a quick review in since there weren't any others here. It's my only mapping program, so I have nothing to compare it to. The program is rather sluggish in moving around the screen and does not display the billboards (upright labels in 3D mode) with a 128 MB video card, even though it says it needs only 32 MB. Other than that, it appears to be as advertised. I got it because I just like maps and occasionally go out in remote areas for astronomy observing or nature hikes.What you can do with it:-Get an idea of what the terrain is like and what roads, hills, lakes, rivers (and some trails) are in the area.-Create routes for driving, hiking, or biking.-Print out detailed maps.-Use it for limited in-car navigation with a GPS receiver (not included) and laptop. Best with a passenger using it, or secure your laptop somewhere to check it if you get lost.What you can't do with it:-Get the level of detail contained in USGS quad maps (i.e., no buildings, not as accurate contours and outlines, no bridges or tunnels)-Expect to find all roads (especially newer ones) and trails.-Rely on it to give you great in-car directions as you drive using a GPS receiver (no voice option, directionally challenged).The learning curve for this program is pretty steep considering its accuracy and level of detail are obviously for casual users. I find myself having to check Help over and over to do the same things because they are not always intuitive. The Help file is good, however, and I've been able to find answers to everything I've looked for.I find moving the map around somewhat cumbersome and slow as it redraws the map (slower with the 3D map). Accuracy seems to be rather poor in spots, as there are omissions and incorrect names here and there. For example, a major highway near my home shows up under a name I have never heard of. A major trail is identified only as a powerline. Another popular trail nearby is missing. Some town names are incorrect in my location, as are town borders, when that feature is turned on. Other users of DeLorme products have noted that they are very slow in updating mapping data (we're talking years, folks). But read reviews of competing products and you'll see similar complaints.I hooked up a GPS receiver via USB and it works fine (using the GlobalSat BU-353-- you don't have to use DeLorme's Earthmate series). I have to run the receiver's program first to get it to show the correct COM port in TOPO USA, but then once it's locked onto the satellites, I can open TOPO USA and connect. I did a test drive around the area and it tracked pretty well along the plotted roads, a few hundred feet behind my actual position. However, it gave all turn information backward, despite correctly placed ""vias"". Because of this and the fact that it runs on a laptop, I don't recommend using it for serious navigation in your car, but rather as a check to see your progress and to find your way back to your route if you get lost. Other products are better suited for real in-car navigation.As for map details, I'm a bit disappointed- all these points of interest mentioned in the advertising seem to be few and far between. Not showing bridges is odd. Having a road go into a gully instead of over a bridge is a bit ludicrous. All of my printed maps show better detail at the same scales (but then, they don't cover the whole U.S., so it's a trade-off).There are a lot of shortcomings, but it looks like the few competitors are in much the same boat. So for the price it's not a bad deal. Just be sure it suits your needs and do some research before you buy. A good resource is a DeLorme forum (forum.delorme.com), where you can read actual users' comments and complaints and decide for yourself. I personally would have preferred more accuracy and detail to all the flashy 3D and customizing options.Basically, it's nice to have a full road map for the whole U.S. that also includes topographical relief, but don't expect it to be the answer to all your mapping needs."

64609,1,"Dora the Explorer: Backpack Adventure is the first CD-ROM starring Dora and her friends. For the parents that have bought Nick Jr. software before, such as the Blue's Clues series, I must warn you, you will be a tad dissapointed. First, however, the pros. Infrogames (that's right, Humongous is gone, Infogames has taken over) has copied 95% of Dora's world into this game. All her friends are there, and are voiced by the TV actors. The music is from the show as well, and Dora asks for your child's help a lot. This game is based on Backpack Adventure, which means you are helping Dora return her books to the library. Now, sadly, we come to the other 5%. First off, if you're looking for free exploration and clickable surprises, you will only find them in 2 screens of this game. The rest of it is game-structured. You finish a game, you're done at that location. Second, the Map screen. When you look at the Map, instead of seeing three locations, you see 7. Still, the Map tells you you only need to go to three of those locations, yet you go to all 7. This could be confusing for a child who has seen the show. Also, if your child likes the songs, he or she is in for a surprise. Only one song is played fully, and two (I'm the Map and Grumpy old Troll) are recited. The other two, Vamanos and Backpack, are shortened. Aside from that, this is a good game for any Dora fan."

8916,1,"For months I was looking for something to CONVERT PDF files to WORD.Most products did a so-so job and I just gave up on the project.Got an email offer to try Nitro PDF and also buy it at a reduced rate.Got the demo at download.com first, to ""test drive"" the program.I had previously downloaded some full color, 6-8 page sales brochures in PDF format.So I started with them and tested the conversion abilities of Nitro pdf.A 6-8 page color document took about 3-5 minutes and reproduced the graphics nearly 100% perfect.[possibly a slight color shift, but definitely ""multitudes"" better than any other product I've tried].So I threw a pdf book with 297 pages and lots of pictures at it.It took about 25 minutes to convert to a Word document format.Again, the quality and graphics converted very nicely.Nitropdf offers a demo at several shareware sites.If you need a PDF creator PLUS a PDF converter, look no further.The version I tested is 4.9.UPDATE 03-08-2006Reviews on PDF-to-Word conversions seem to be all over the spectrum.In my case, the PDF files I used as test subjects were mostly technical IT-type white-papers and IT related books; that were originally published as soft and hard-back books.The images being somewhat simplistic, in B&W; (not color).I would really like to see a review done by a major softwarereview site, which takes every PDF-to-WORD software pkg anduses the exact same files as test files/subjects.Then we could truly compare apples to apples and oranges to oranges.In my personal experiences, Nitro PDF did better at PDF-to-Word conversions than any other pkg I demo'd.Another reviewer mentioned AABBY software.I first obtained a full version of ABBYY software from a pc type magazine from the UK. It came with a CD rom disc that included a full version of ABBYY finereader pro, version 5.(Prior to that, I had no clue as to who ABBYY was).When I loaded ABBYY finereader V5, obtained my free unlock/registration key code, installed it and started using the product for OCR, I was totally impressed.Having tried most every other OCR program out there, I immediately fell in love with ABBYY.The accuracy of what it scanned was amazing; considering I was using various ""inexpensive"" scanners (all under $100 regular price, all on sale for under $50).Considering that scansoft OCR products are between $99 to $150 and that ABBYY is usualy around $179 (or under $100 as an upgrade, INCLUDING competitive upgrades), I would spend the extra to buy the ABBYY finereader OCR.I like the ABBYY results.I really like the ABBYY ""UPGRADE"" policy.If you can show proof of purchase for a competitor's OCR software, ABBYY will still give you their software at an UPGRADE reduced price. It's a liberal upgrade policy.Some software makers are so tight-fisted with upgrade policy's; accepting only the previous version of their own product and nothing else.Getting back to the PDF-to-WORD conversions.I strongly suggest you TRY before you buy.In my case, Nitro did a great job; while other folks mentioned less than satisfactory results.But I've heard that it really depends on the complexity of the PDF being converted.I've read how some PDF's are easier, or convert better, due to the makeup of the document and/or how it was created.PS. Tip on getting Nitro for 50% off.Sign up at V-com and/or Nitro PDF for their newsletter.A 1/2 price offer for Nitro PDF goes out to their email lists about every 3 months."

The truth is that Fritz 9 is only slightly stronger than fritz 8. This does nothing for a serious chess player. Hiarcs 10 waited and waited to save up enough money to do a big update on the program.

671,1,"I use 3-d CAD software in work so I have had some experience in this type of software. I have used a older version of the 3-d broderbund software and found it somewhat intuitive but the graphics were disappointing. I was ready to get a newer version figuring the graphics would be better when I came across this software.We are modifying an older home and I was looking to get a feel for the flow of the house before we moved some walls and get a visual feel for what the rooms are going to look like. This software did the trick. I havn't opened the book and have most of the floorplan done with modifications we were looking for(9 room house 2200 SF = 5 hours, no training, all windows, doors, furniture etc. havn't done the roof nor kitchen yet). The elevation scale was a bit difficult to understand and the auto-wall dimensioning had a lot to be desired. Although the graphics are good in detail they are very slow in rendering.I agree there are shortcommings to this program and if I designed houses for a living or was designing from scratch, this might not be the tool to use (I only have experience with one other program so I am NOT an expert). From a relative ease of use and a method for visualizing room size, house flow, lighting etc, it works great. I am looking forward to finishing the rest of the house.I am running Win98 2nd edition on a P3 500 256 MBram 32Meg diamond video card and have not had any system preformance nor graphics rendering problems.Like any other review, use it with a grain of salt.

The storyline doesn't involve Sam learning anything like the previous games.WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?It seems that, after successfully expanding the Backyard Sports line, they decided to take a chance with the Junior Adventures. The thing is, so many original people from Humongous left by the time the company was sold to Atari, that they had no guidance whatsoever, except for a few copies of the other Pajama Sams. Being 'busy executives', however, they had NO time to thoroughly play through the game, and immediately assumed it had only one path.The result was a game that is COMPLETELY devoid of all the charm of the other Junior Adventures. The graphics were good, but the one path and other things put me off. However, I must commend them for at least attempting to mimic the greatness of Humongous Entertainment.Nice try, Atari. Better stick to the Backyard Sports from now on."
37718,1,"I have played around with some of these virtual instruments to find that some of them are quite good-sounding. The Moog series VSTs are somewhat less attractive that, say ARP VST. They all are CP memory-consuming plug-ins that also require sound cards with good latency characteristics (otherwise you have to play the instrument in MIDI mode with a reduced latency, allowing for clicks and pops to appear, and then increase the latency before the recording is mixed down to an audio file). The Moog series have lots of factory settings that mostly out of the range of pleasant and purposeful sounds. It is often hard to use them either as leads or bass sounds, and they need to be tweaked so some extent. Besides, some of the sounds are overwhelming and destroy the rest of the sounds in your recording. If you're after bass sounds, I'd suggest the Arp 2600 VST instead."
66602,1,"I've been a user of SuSE Linux since 7.3, but this is the first time I felt I had to really speak out for Linux.SuSE has done an INCREDIBLE job of making Linux end-user accessible.Out of the box, SuSE Linux supports a wide variety of hardware and includes a TON of applications, including the openoffice.org office suite (which is essentially ""Star Office 6"" without the database program.)Changing hardware is a snap! I've upgraded a video card and sound card and SuSE picked them up in a snap. It works just as well as Windows XP in that regard.And unlike Windows, there is no ridiculous ""product activation"" nonsense! As I change hardware often, I got very tired of dealing with Microsoft to reactivate something I legally purchased and paid for.Also, none of SuSE's included programs transmit private data back to some scheming, untrustworthy company. Just try that on your favorite monopoly's bloaty media player program for example...And the new KDE user interface is beyond fantastic! Text is no longer jagged, the interface is more intuitive than Microsoft's ""Explorer"" (more customizable, too), and the screen savers alone are worth the purchase of this OS.And provided you don't use the NTFS file system (though you can still use Windows NT, 2000 Pro, or XP Home/Pro), you can have Linux peacefully co-exist with Windows, if you come across a Windows app that won't run under any of Linux's emulation programs. (I use Win4Lin, Wine, and WineX)Games like Unreal Tournament 2003 and Return to Castle Wolfenstein are also made natively for Linux. And they run much faster under Linux than they do Windows.

I don't like the fact that they have gotten rid of a large portion of the customizations for the home page. I also found when I was pulling my tax information for this year, that the reports were not the same as the previous version and I had to build my own. Other then that, I think that it is a good peice of software."

With OS X 10.1, the whole app uses the same Aqua guidelines and features very well--the dialog boxes, icons, the way you can use and edit small images in your word docs, etc. Plus, you don't have to hear the old &quot;send document x to us in word format&quot; ever again :-) So even with some of the main features turned off in the test Drive, you'll see what great potential this version has for OS X users (but you'll need version 10.1)"

7432,0,"I was disappointed that the descriptions and reviews of this product did not point out that the software cannot compile (a feature of VB) and is missing some other features so that an upgrade to VB is necessary to gain all features use. Otherwise, the book and software are good to get down VB basics."
15583,1,All the poor reviews on this product are ridiculous novices who don't know what they are talking about. Bad burns are not the software they are your burner or the media. Did you ever try burning at a LOWER speed before you left your false comments?? Nero defaults to MAX speed for all burns and just because your burner may tell Nero it's capable at that speed doesn't mean it IS!! Also what speed is your blank Media capable of?? Also if you have an OLD burner without its own buffer inside you definitely have to slow down the burn speed. This software works flawlessly and this is the Ultra so everybody complaining about upgrades are leaving their comments for the WRONG product!! You are talking about the Essentials product which comes FREE with burners!! The Essentials software ONLY comes bundled and isn't sold as a store product. The title says it all...ESSENTIALS!!! Nero has a great product and I have done video editing and MANY numerous audio and video burns fantastically error free except for one dual layer that Nero burned at a faster speed than the Media could handle. There are many ways to ensure clean burns if you check them like in Nero recode having it do 2 passes instead of one. Too many people want to have Nero finish faster than their burner or blank Media are capable of. Know your burner and Media and set burn speeds accordingly.

91241,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

24571,2,"Bought this game for my son only to find that it won't work for Mac OS X operating systems. The packaging on the game says that it will work for this system, but OS X doesn't have the New York 18 font so the game just keeps telling you to install it. Apparently, you can get this font from OS 9, but why would I buy an older operating system for just one font! This is very frustrating because the game is useless! The packaging should not list OS X as an acceptable operating system. My son and I are both very disappointed!Unfortunately, the price I paid isn't worth the hassle of trying to return or else I definitely would!"

This program will take you into the solar system and into deep space better than anything you can see through a ""backyard"" 'scope. It lets you control space, time, magnification and just about anything you would want to. I'm sure that professional astronomers will enjoy it and if you have children, no matter what age, you can turn yourself into their personal astronomy tutor, or just let the computer do it. This is the prime reason to own it. Viva media and Maris technologies have really outdone themselves this time!"

62375,1,"I read all the bad reviews before buying this product, but I bought it anyway because I couldn't find any other software that can move programs from one computer to another. I have software on an old computer that I've lost the CDs for and which can no longer be bought (Visual Studio 6.0) I successfully transferred Microsoft Office, Visual Studio 6.0 (with C++ and Basic), Photoshop, and some other programs. There were a couple less important programs which didn't transfer correctly. I didn't find it difficult to use, but the process was very tedious. My old computer couldn't establish the USB connection so I had to use a serial cable connection. The entire process took about 7 hours. I wasn't interested in tranferring preferences or &quot;favorites&quot; so I can't speak to whether those transfer as well. All in all, it was a pain but I was able to get what I needed - at considerably less cost than having to buy Visual Studio.Net (which I didn't even want but 6.0 isn't sold anymore). I would definitely spring for the &quot;Ultra&quot; version because otherwise I think you have to transfer everything. That would have taken DAYS!"

It is creative and unique in its' own way.Not to mention fun. I enjoyed this. But, my 4 year old son grabbed hold of my mouse and LOVES to race with this. He is very good. Actually,almost better than me. This game has little learning curve and can run on low end computers. THIS IS NOT A STUNT GAME.It is not advertised as one.It is advertised as a racing game. And it is about an 85% in my book. Not perfect...but very well executed."

I use the program in my laptop and when hooked up to my GPS, I have what amounts to a super detailed car navigation system with a 17"" screen. As new maps become available, you can download them free into your computer as needed and it's a very easy procedure. Also, free upgrades are available on-line and that's an easy procedure too.To make the state series most useable, you need to add Back Roads Explorer, which gives much more detailed up-to-date street and street name information.The only caveates with this program is that you need a relatively fast computer and lots of memory so you can copy the whole program to your hard drive so you don't have to constantly change cd's. Also, expect to take some time to fully get to know this program."
31342,1,"Back in the day, this grafx biz we're in used to be easier. You knew your target medium (paper or film), artwork could be massaged, and--dammit-deadlines were reasonable. Now you better be able to rebuild and repurpose overnight! At last Adobe has brought to Illustrator some of the things the Macromedia people have been jeering at the lack of for so long. Key functionality like being able to reslice around that new layout, combine and modify vector and raster grafx, CSS, FLASH format support(!!!!)...on and on.You may not have the [money] for this upgrade right now. If in that case, pull Mama out of the home for a month or two, and use the money to buy this upgrade, especially if you do a lot of multiformat work. Now that this functionality is available in Illustrator, you have virtually full round trip between your Mmedia and Adobe packages. Not everything works the way you'd intuitively guess, and some web things are still easier in Fireworks, but the longer you forgo this, the more those baggy-pants youngsters are going to be eating your clients's lunch, or--more likely-- eating lunch with your clients."
33548,1,"Paradox 9DE is the single best introduction to real programming. People with a database background will find it easy. I found it to be the easiest Visual development program that comes with a complete language. It is funny that I am also a beginner and it gave me the first taste of programming power with its ObjectPAL. Paradox Developer Edition has an &quot;Application Framework&quot; with the basics pre-programmed for you (much easier than doing an interface from scratch in VB or Delphi). Then you start to build your application inside that framework using &quot;forms&quot;. There is a book named &quot;Database Design for Mere Mortals&quot; by Mike Hernandez. It served me as the &quot;key&quot; of what can be accomplished in Paradox 9 DE. You can find the book here. I was looking for &quot;authoring&quot; tools and eventually spent a few hundred dollars on them. I have a friend who is a good FoxPro programmer and he told me &quot;don't spend the money on prosthetic brain replacements, study programming and when you start to grasp the power of a language, authoring tools will appear like a child's toy&quot; and he was right. I was always hunting for the most powerful &quot;authoring environment&quot; when the simple fact is that if you work hard with programming concepts for a few months, one day comes when it all starts to make sense. Paradox is unique in that you take a piece of code and attach it to an object (button, checkbox, etc). It will do what you tell it to do. It makes learning easy for aspiring programmers without compromises in what can be done. And last but not least everything you need for building SQL and Client/Server applications is in the box. Period. JPdox is a separate included application (feels like Visual Basic) that builds JAVA forms for the Web, which can connect live to your Paradox database (if you're familiar with TCP/IP and want to run a serious, solid JAVA data-driven website from your NT server). Application developer? The end product you build will look, feel and WORK like any other Windows application. Data-driven web using Java? All the monkeys are in the box. Authoring - did you buy an &quot;authoring&quot; tool to make a small program only to discover it lacks database support, it doesn't support checkboxes and it's variables hold only 256 characters? Did it cost a little more than Paradox? Well, no game or multimedia authoring tool is complete without Paradox, whether it has the ability to query a database or not."
90900,0,"BEWARE- they don't tell you upfront that Word 2007 isn't easily compatible with Word 2003...especially for those upgrading...a lot of the 2003 features and 2007 features do not work together, thereby many 2007 Word docs will not read in Word 2003 and visa versa. If you go to the MS Office website you can download a ""converter"" to convert 2003 Office docs to 2007 format, but who wants to have to go through that everytime..makes you wonder what they were thinking in Redmond, WA when they designed this new software?

I will say that if you think of buying Ghost 10 or any other back up software, Stop and think before you make that purchase. You can download a trail for FREE. Do that. Run a back up and try to recover and make sure the Recovery is compatible with your hardware. Retest after any hardware change. If you feel comfortable with your product and you like the way it works, then go ahead and buy it. Here are what are argumentatively the top 3 Disk backup software (at least as far as toptenreviews.com writes) and all 3 have a FREE trials.

It does this wonderfully and burning it to a VCD is so easy. I have really been inspired by this and I have started taking even more video. I have done several 5 or 6 minute clips of all types. I love it. While it does freeze up occassionally, it has not been nearly so bad as I read on some other reviews. It does NOT, however, import my video. I have had to use an older Dazzle product and software to do this."

Other Sellers indicated they were missing the guide and advertised a lower price. I paid more for what was suppose to be a complete set.

40853,0,"Till recently, words like ""Firewall"" and ""Hackers"" were limited to corporate networks. However, today firewall software for home computers has gained as much importance as the virus protection software and rightly so. With fast, always on internet connections and computers that don't need to be shut down every night, your home pc is an easy target for hackers looking for a host pc to run their web pages or applications, to steal informatin like credit card numbers and address or just to hone their skills. This is why you need the firewall. There is no question about it.The real question to ask is ""Do I need to spend close to 70 bucks to buy ZoneAlarm?""The answer is NO. Most email programs like yahoo and hotmail already have virus protection. Most people have some sort of virus protection on their computer too. If not, then better choice is Norton and MacAffee, not ZA.You do need firewall though which is not provided by virus protection packages but there are a few things you should know before buying ZA.Firstly, if you are on Windows XP you already have basic firewall protection. Please look at your manual to see how to turn it on. For most users this is enough. If you are really interested in getting more protection, read on.If you have a router to share your internet connection with multiple home machines, then check the router manual. Many have firewall capability which is very powerfull and can protect you from most attacks. This firewall is as good as ZoneAlarm.If you don't have either, you will need something like ZA. But before you rush to order it, I would encourage you to try the free trial version available from www.download.com. At this website, you will also find lot of other firewall programs for free.Finally if you still wanna buy ZA then you should be aware of following problems:1) If you have virus protection software like Norton or McAfee, ZA may actually mess your system up as all these softwares try to grab same files at startup time causing conflicts and system crashes. I had such a hard time that I had to uninstall ZA and clean up my entire system. The problem can be so bad that you may actually not be able to log into your machine at all.2) Poor customer service: ZA doesn't have good, knowledgable customer service. If you run into technical issues, don't expect quick, easy to follow directions to get out of the mess.That said, I still consider ZA to be a good alternative if you do not have Windows' built in firewall or router with firewall capability. However, do try the free version before you buy ZA Pro."

34844,0,"CAVEAT: This is a CONCISE math software which was not intended to replace your textbooks or any other medium of information to study math but rather it was intended to be annexed to your collection of subject. The package brings 4CD's.. College Algebra(1), Pre-Calculus(2), Calculus(3) and Statistics(4) all of which are equilavent in format and display. College Algebra has many topics starting from rudiment algebra(factoring-polynomials-rules for exponents example a^b(c^d)= ac^b+d etc.. to functions-logs-exponential functions-synthetic division-conic sections(equations for geometry objects example Circle equation r^2=(x-a)^2 - (y-b)^2 ..etc now each CD explains its topics in page(s) with a few paragraphs you may run into some words that are highlighted in blue thats for you to click on it for it's terminology if your having a tough time comprehending a word(example..ax^n-1 'a' is the coefficient of the term ax^n-1). Some topics have step-by-step visual with audio and written explanation for the algorithm of a given expression, equation, radical..etc some if not all topics begin with a video to give you an idea of the subject in the 'real world' before you begin to study it and how you can apply it. Of course it has testing to put your comprehension of a given subject.. which each test questions ranges from x-z in questions so the number of questions depends on the topic. The sense of humor in this software is ok for it's educational function. I didn't encounter any problems installing it in my machine(XP) or any problems whatsoever.. I've used this software with another software(Mind Math High School) and textbooks and works well in combination since every other medium approaches different subjects differently don't expect to have a complete rigorous explanation with this software. Overall its a nice software with its limitation on certain subjects."
77550,1,"I've used Partition Magic since version 3.0. Partition Magic 7.0 is now WinXP compatable and supports hard drives up to 80 GB. This software is a phenominal program that allows hard drive repartitioning &quot;on-the-fly&quot; and easy booting into different operating systems. I have a PC-DOS/Win3.1 partition and a Win98SE partition on the same hard drive and a WixXP partition (preview version) on a second hard drive. I have also had a Linux partition on the first drive. You can resize partitions and convert from fat 16 to fat32 and back. You can also divide one large hard drive into several drives to help organize data and files. Boot Magic (and the previous Boot Manager) are great to allow easy booting into any OS that you have on your drive. Partition Magic has never given my a problem. I have never lost data. The manual is clear, well written and easy to follow. If you want to have more than one OS on your computer or to try out a new OS or upgrade (like WinXP), then this program is a must have.

83856,0,"In 1998, I purchased a computer, printer and scanner from HP. The scanners software included Adobe PhotoDeluxe 3.0 with Intellifix by Extensis. About a year ago, I became the family genealogist and I scanned hundreds of old family photos from the 1860s to this year. Many of the photos were in poor condition with tears, rips and discoloration. APDHE 3.0's Repair Old Photo's cloning tool worked absolutely great. Instead of upgrading the old Win 98, I decided to buy a new computer. After studying what computers are now available, I switched to a Mac. I am happy that I did but I had to buy some software. I purchased Adobe Photoshop Elements 3.0 for Mac. I heard so much about the ""healing brush."" But, although PSE can do many more things much quicker than PDHE, the healing brush was a great disappointment. I doesn't work as well as the old cloning tool. PSE works very well if the photos are in good condition but the healing brush cannot repair damaged photos which is what I was looking for. I no longer use PSE at all. I'd gladly trade it for a PDHE for Mac. I have had to keep my old Win 98 with the printer and scanner so that I can continue repairing thousands of old photos. One box down and 29 boxes of photos to go. Now, I am looking at the Amazon site trying to find another software that can repair my old photos using the Mac."

If you use email like I do, you are definitely no stranger to viruses that lurk around every corner in cyberspace. Norton saved me plenty of times and the 40 or so dollars you spend on this product is worth its cost 50 times that because of what a virus can do to a computer without you knowing it. If I didn't have this software, who knows how much I would had to have spent fixing my system.Norton is probably the premier choice when it comes to anti-virus software. I've experimented with others and find this company to offer the best and most easy to use system. 2003 is not too different from 2002 as everything is basically the same. The layout menu has slightly changed (more so in color), but everything is the same. Newer virus definitions have been added and the update feature is easy to use and navigate. Norton makes their software easy to configure unlike their competitors which I find handy especially when I want to tell the system what I want it to do instead of the software telling me what to do. You can't go wrong with Norton!"

We picked up our rental van in Milan at Malpensa airport and drove directly to our lodging 12K south of Siena with no missed turns and on some gravel roads This trip was about 4and 1/2 hours in duration. We toured in Tuscany to San Gimignano, Siena, Montalcino and Montepulciano. Again, we had no missed turns. We drove from our lodging south of Siena and drove to Rome's port of Civitavecchia. Again, we had no missed turns. This card worked flawlessly for us in the areas we traveled. I had printed maps and directions for all our travels. After 30 minutes we put them on the floor for the balance of our driving. The only minor issue that was a bit entertaining was the pronunciation of the Italian streets. When in doubt, we looked at the screen depiction and it always correctly indicated our next action. Don't leave home without it."

This package contains everything one person would need to compose, arrange, record and mix down a complete movie soundtrack and bounce it to CD's (stereo) or go all the way to a 5.1 surround format for DVD applications.

17456,1,"I recently bought a new laptop that had a horrible blue color cast on the monitor. I purchased this product because it was recommended by an instructor from a Photoshop class I took. Originally I had problems running the program because the driver for the Spyder would not install. My laptop runs on Windows Vista 64-bit operating system, and I have found most software programs need to be updated for the 64-bit program. This one is no exception. I took a while for me to find the update (Spyder2express 2.3.6 [...]) I needed to install in order to fix this particular problem. Once I found it and installed the update, everything ran smoothly, and my monitor looks MUCH better."

She loves it, except for the fact that the ""downloads"" portion of the software does not work due to discontinuation. It looks like it never worked. I think that is very misleading and the programmers should follow through with their promise. But, all of the complaints about - this didnt work or that didnt work or I got this error - a majority of the problems are probably with their pc's and something they have loaded conflicting. It happens, I am a computer tech, so I see it all the time. This was installed on my laptop for her and her desktop with not 1 problem at all. I highly recommend."

44467,1,"Brought my Garmin Nuvi to Austria with a Europe card in it. Honestly, it made my trip so much better. First, I didn't have to keep referring to maps or stopping for directions. And...I never got lost! Well, once, but for a 2 week trip...that's pretty good.Also, because the Nuvi goes into pedestrian mode, when I parked our car, I was able to save it in Favorites and easily find my way back when the time came. But as for having the Europe card, it was so much more productive to know exactly where to walk to see different sites.Also, the sights and restaurant suggestions were pretty good and up to date.One criticism is that sometimes when I put in a smaller town to drive to, there were several towns with the same name and while I could logically figure out which one I wanted by the distance, some of the regions and countries were mentioned in foreign languages which made it confusing. In other words, all of a sudden, when they would name the country the town was in, they would use the Austrian word for ""Austria"" for no apparent reason at all. A minor disturbance forA product that really helped me travel.Myles"
1915,0,"OK, let me first admit my ignorance when it comes to such material. I don't know a hyperlink from a hyperkid and will probably never learn. I bought this product because of its glowing recommendations and more specifically for its claim that this product is for beginners as well. Well, forget that. This is undoubtedly a godsend for the design software literate, but as a beginner, I struggled. I felt like the poor slobs on Saturday Night Live when the computer geek is trying to explain to them what's wrong with their computers and they just don't get it. For instance, in one section they tell you to choose a ""theme"" from the pulldown list. I didn't like any of the template backgrounds, but they were not very clear as to how you can incorporate your own. Do they allow your own design? I'm sure they do, but as a beginner, it wasn't made clear at what point in the process you could do so. I saved and exited numerous times out of frustration, promising to come back again after reading more of the manual. Here's a sample of the directions on page 23 of the manual. Hold on you beginners our there . . . ""If you want to use the auto linking feature, enter @*(the word you want to replace)in the Replace text box and the URL in the With text box. Example: ""@Namo*"" => ""http://www.namo.com*"" (if you enter ""@Namo"" appears with the hyperlinks whose URL is ""www.namo.com"".)"" Did you get that? Again, I don't doubt the wonderment of this product, I really don't. I respect the expert reviews out there that shower this product with accolades, but if this is for beginners then I am even more ""lame"" than my teenage daughter thinks I am. I will probably go to a web site designer and pay $100 to $200 to get me up and running. I wish this product worked for me as it did for others, but you need to bring more than basic computer knowledge to this software to get where you're going. Good luck."

86308,0,"I have used The Master Genealogist since the days when it was DOS-based and the early Windows version. TMG is one powerful program, more suited to either 1) a professional genealogist, or 2) someone that has the patience to learn how to properly use the program (it has a high learning curve). It allows for a wealth of information types and provides the ability to thoroughly document any and all kinds of sources for your data. It also has an extensive list of reports and can even produce a book on your family history. What's not to like!Well, over the years and the subsequent versions of TMG for Windows, the program has not been updated as thoroughly as other genealogy software as far as the user interface and data entry. Other companies have improved their products, making it easier to input your data and document it. Other companies have produced a 32-bit program. To me, TMG feels like a clumsy windows interface slapped onto the older DOS-version of the program. Entering source documentation was (and is) a nightmare and caused me to be less thorough documenting my sources than I should have been. I suspect the company didn't want to go to the trouble or expense to totally rewrite the program to take advantage of 32 & 64-bit Windows. The one thing I can say is that the few times I've needed help with the program, Wholly Genes (manufacturer or TMG) has been very responsive to email messages (though phone support was a negative experience). The final straw was that the last version made a change in the data input screens which made the program seem more clumsy to use instead of less. That was the point I began to try out other genealogy programs and discovered Legacy Family Tree, which is now (2013) nearly as powerful as The Master Genealogist but much, much easier to use. (For the record, I find most genealogy programs that are worth their salt, or your money, do have a learning curve and it's best to review its documentation and any videos you can find. Also, some of the programs have trial or 'lite' versions you can try out before committing your hard earned money to purchasing the full product).I don't want to trash TMG at all, it is a great program for a certain audience. For the average family researcher though, there are better choices than when I started with TMG back around 1993. I hope that someday the software will be thoroughly updated and brought into the 21st century. BTW, most reviews I've seen on Amazon for TMG are several years old. Wholly Genes has recently released TMG version 8.0 which is the latest as of 1/1/2013. I tried it out a few months ago and the problems I had with it still remain for the most part. They do offer a trial version and I'd recommend you try it before you make a final decision on buying it. Also, if you do purchase it here or elsewhere, make sure you're getting the latest version."

Also, there is no place to search.I recall spending hours trying to discover how to get v. 8 to insert spaces when inserting text (no, the obvious ""NOSPACES OFF"" does not work for that purpose). Without a usable knowledgebase and $10/question for e-mail support, I think I am better off just continuing to type (I won't even bother reinstalling v. 8, even though I paid for it).I feel sorry for the rest of you."

He liked this software and could spend quite a while exploring it. If a 3-year-old kid can use it, it proves that it is really easy to use. It is better to give kids something great like this to kill time with rather than some violent PC games. At the mean time, they become more knowledgable also.

16079,0,"I used these maps in Poland and never got lost, however, with these maps the GPS finds quite convoluted ways to get to places. I didn't mind because that way, I saw much more of the country. But if that's not what you want, it will be quite annoying. One problem, I suspect, is that there isn't much data on what's a primary road and what's a secondary road. Also, there's no traffic information, so my guess is that shortest time is calculated purely using distance because that's all the information that's available. It does appear that the maps become less detailed the further east you go, so these maps may be much better for western Europe."

The cash flow report is always the most important part of quicken because it allows the user to track personal finances.One small bug has always botherered me, however. For retirement accounts containing mutual funds, quicken adds all distributions to the account holder's basis. This is inconsistent with IRS practice, which is that the distributions are not taxed and therefore are not added to the shareholder's basis. This bug leads to some inaccurate gain and loss results for retiremment accounts."

20370,0,"Hi all. This software both SUCKS and is GREAT. The diffuclty is in Overpasses and off ramps. It gets easily confused with you being ""On Route"" and ""Off Route"". OFTEN it would tell us to turn right, or ""Take Local Road"", and we would miss our turn. What was GREAT about the software was being able to locate yourself on the map, and tell what you really needed to do. Navigation is a little clunky, and takes some getting use to. We used this software in Germany and a little bit of Switzerland. The other options was a Garmin with Europe Maps, for Hundreds of dollars, or this simple program. We utilized the ""Microsoft GPS received"" that comes with their US product. It did allow for printing of maps, and was worth the price paid. HOWEVER do not think that you can simply jump in the car and use this as a 100% navigation aid."
18415,0,"I've had the original Stunt Track Driver for almost two years. It was a good game because you raced on tracks throughout the house using a huge track layout you could never afford. It was also a fun game and incorporated tricks into the racing action. Unfortuantely Stunt Track Driver 2 doesn't live up to the expectations. The first problem is the graphics, they are more detailed than in the first game but these good graphics come at a big price. The game has a very low frame rate thus making you feel as if there is no sense of speed. Also, when you are in the middle of the race, the game sometimes pauses to load sometimes when in a turn or when you are in mid-air causing you to crash (this happens most notably in the Beach level and sometimes in the Garden level). But the graphics aren't the biggest problem of the game, the major problem is the huge difficulty of the game. I consider my self a hard core game player and have been playing games for over twelve years. It took me three days to beat the original Stunt Track Driver. I figured it would take even less time to beat the sequel. I was very wrong. In the championship mode, you are given 1 minute and 15 seconds to finish the first course. Even if you don't crash once, you won't finish the course within the time limit. You have to do huge combos of tricks at each and every jump to even have a chance of finishing the course within the alloted time. After I fianlly beat that course, the second course is even worse! The Garden track has turns that are hidden meaning you have to memorize the track to know when to turn without crashing. I doubt I'll ever beat this game. If, I, myself can't beat this game then what chance does a five year old have of even beating one course? If you don't have the any Stunt Track Driver game, buy the first one, it is less money and a whole lot of more fun. If you do have the orignal Stunt Track Driver, I reccomend Rush 2049. It has crazy jumps and a stunt mode and is a great game. And at least you know you'll be able to beat the game."

85841,1,"I got this to transfer my VHS tapes to DVD format before VHS players were no longer sold. The problem is that video recording is computationally intense. You will get jerky video if you overload the processor.My 1.86 GHz computer was able to capture in best quality MPEG for black and white and best quality avi for color source material after I had done the following things:There are two things not mentioned in the directions that you have to do. When capturing from tape you have to check the VCR box to prevent the video from wobbling left and right. The other is that you have to have the capture device and your external drive on different interfaces, one on USB and the other on FireWire. Otherwise you will overload the USB or the FireWire buss controller and get jerky recordings. Use the test drive button to find which buss has the higher write speed on your drive. If your external drive has nothing on it you want and if you are technically skilled you can do a quick format on it with different sector sizes to find the highest write speed setting.With slower computers you have to disable the preview option. You will also have to disconnect from the network and shut down all programs shown in the system tray including Norton Antivirus. It is best to do a virus sweep with the latest definitions before disabling Norton. Then make test recordings from color and black and white tapes. Start with best quality and then watch the results on the edit tab to look for jerky motion. Try both recording options, avi and mpeg. If both cause jerky motions, try the better option. Then go to custom and adjust the quality % to the highest level that does not have jerky motion.The advantage of mpeg capture is that it takes less room on the hard drive and makes the third tab make movie processing time shorter. The extra storage space is of no real advantage if you do not intend to permanently store the files after you have burnt your DVD. The shortened time in the third tab is no real advantage if you have to do the capture at a lower quality setting.Then on the make movie tab select make file to be burnt later. Then select the burn from stored file to do the DVD recording. Select the external drive for this option or you will get 10 GB of files left on your internal drive that you will have to manually delete if you need the room.If you have a 3+ GHz machine you can use preview, best quality capture and burn the disk while making the movie.Then there was a quirk of my Dell 9300 of its accessing the internal drive several times a minute which caused jerky motion. To overcome this I had to boot the computer with the peripherals disconnected, wait until the boot is finished, and then connect them one at a time. Then I had to wait 30 minutes while the computer did the internal bookkeeping and accessed the internal drive. After the 30 minutes this stopped. Then start the Pinnacle software. One quirk of the software is that it only recognizes devices that are running when the program starts, so you have to have your external DVD burner (if you use one) and external hard drive attached to the computer and powered before starting the Pinnacle software."
47731,1,"With the price jump from around [$$$] for Logic Platinum to around [$$$] for Logic Pro, it's worth while considering that Logic Plat didn't come with any of the soft synths that are built into it. You have to pay an average of between [$$$] for each extra instrument [along with the vocoder and space designer] so the [$$$] price jump isnt bad at all. I bought Logic 6 Platinum and the upgrade price to Pro is worth it and I am very glad that I did NOT buy the seperate instruments. If you already did, then the upgrade might not be as worth it. I can't find too much info on what else is new or improved with this version. Logic may have a learning curve, but once you learn it inside and out, it's probably the most powerful Audio/MIDI package available. If only audio is your primary concern and you want something simple, then ProTools should be considered. But if you want total control over everything, then Logic is the way to go. Id say Logic for composers and more complex music, and ProTools for bands looking to record. Logic is also compatible with TDM hardware systems."
4492,1,"This is my 5th version of Paint Shop Pro and this version is the best! I have been using Paint Shop Pro Photo XI for about one month now and do not understand the negative reviews of this program. I haven't had any problems at all! The times I have had to use Corel's support in the past they have helped fairly quickly and efficiently. I haven't had any problems at all working with large files. No freezing up, no slow processing.I understand some are still upset over the loss of Jasc, but Corel, IMO, is doing a great job with the software that Jasc so strongly stood behind.My main hobby is photo restoration and Paint Shop Pro has met my never-ending needs each time I use it.This newest version includes some new fun tools.The Time Machine gives a very cool effect to photos, realistically transforming them back in time with just one click.The new Organizer is invaluable. You can view, organize and even e-mail right from the application. No need to open up another program. You can also view video clips from your digital camera!The color changer tool works very well. It just takes a little practice. The results are so much better than having to carefully select the object, then floodfill THEN lower the opacity so the texture shows through. Very handy.All in all this is an excellent release from Corel. I highly recommend the upgrade. If you are a previous owner and if you are a beginner, you won't find a better image editor at this price! The Learning center makes learning the program easy. The tools are smart and powerful enough for the more experienced.It rivals the powerful Adobe Photoshop at hundreds of dollars less. You really can't go wrong.Don't let a few disgruntled people steer you away from a great program. You won't find better.Sincerely,Laura Hawkins"

58214,1,"This is the second game in the Nancy Drew software series that I've tried (I've also played &quot;Message In a Haunted Mansion&quot;), and this was by far the more difficult of the two. In this game, Nancy is staying with a soap star, Mattie, whose on-screen co-star, Rick, has been receiving death threats. It's up to Nancy to find out who is behind them. The game requires not only patience but a smart mind; you have to remember things and write down clues, solve puzzles, and plan things accordingly. Although I enjoyed playing it, it was frustrating at times, and one time, I spent several hours thinking I was stuck, because I had not noticed the arrival of an important new object. (Boy did I feel silly when I finally noticed it!) This game will take you many hours to complete. For fans of the older Nancy Drew books, there's an added bonus -- the games feature objects from the books (look for the clock from &quot;The Secret of the Old Clock&quot;, with the crescent on the top!) and other little fun things like that. I want to offer two hints that I think will be helpful: #1, pay attention to the chair in Mattie's house, near the phone. #2, explore all rooms **thoroughly**. You will pick up many objects during this game, and all will either be important, or finding them will just advance the game. You may need to explore rooms two or three times to find everything. Also, if after you've installed this game (or Message In A Haunted Mansion), you get an error message that the game can not locate a Direct Draw Surface, and you KNOW your computer meets all the system requirements, make sure your hardware acceleration is set to FULL. If you're using Windows 98 you can do this by going to your Control Panel, clicking on &quot;Display&quot;, then clicking on the &quot;Settings&quot; tab, then clicking the &quot;Advanced...&quot; button, then clicking the &quot;Performance&quot; tab, and pushing the bar all the way up to &quot;Full.&quot; Then you'll need to restart you computer. This solved the problem for me. Hope this helps! All in all, this is a very fun game for teenage girls and young women (and hey, guys too!), great for friends and family members to play together, and just an all-in-all wonderful game. I hope Dreamcatcher and HER Interactive make more of these!"
64464,1,"Nancy is in San Francisco in Rose's mansion. There are mysterious accidents going on and it's Nancy's job to figure out whose causing them. This game is the third in the series so it's kinda old. When walking around in hallways its kinda confusing the screen jumps so far ahead you get kinda lost. took me forever to learn where all the rooms are such as the room im staying in and where to find the owner. maybe its just me. the letters i find throughout the house were really hard to read because of the script handwriting, so i didn't read half of them, some were impossible to read! Since this is an early nancy drew game, you have that annoying alarm clock. Sometimes in order to get ahead in the game all you have to do is go set the alarm for the next morning or later on that day so something can finally happen. kinda stupid. but the theme was fun it actually freaked me out a few times with the ghosts wandering around and im a grown woman!"

Now that we've been forced to use XP, I guess what I said doesn't mean anything now.--------------------------------------------------------------Windows XP (either version-they're both the same) has advantages and added features over previous versions of Windows, but all they do are save you a few seconds and make things more colorful.The problems with Windows XP are: 1)There is no DOS prompt (older programs will not work on XP) 2)A lot of hardware and software is incompatible 3)The stupid animated icons and unnecessary colors and dummy features will get on your nerves.YOU DONT REALLY NEED THIS!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!Windows 98SE is good enough for most purposes."
1626,1,I fell in love with outlook a few years ago working on a project in church. We also just start using outlook 2003 at work and I knew I had to have outlook on my home computer. I am so glad I have purchased it. It will help me with a lot in planning my lessons for church.

The action was well cordinated!4. The Basic plot was good!5. The set designs were excellent!6. The visual effects were impressive!7. The creatures were scary and looked real!8. It had an excellent soundtrack!What I didn't like about it:1. The movie had too many slow parts!2. There were times when the characters whispered too much!3. I would like to have known a little more about Scorpion and Sub-Zero;true if you played the video game or watched the animated movie (Mortal Kombat:The Journey Begins) you would know more, but those who didn't do eitherthe director and writers could have given us a little background info onthem, especially since they are two big fan favorites!Overall, this was a cool movie! I'm glad it got a sequel too!But it deserved a better sequel though!My grade: B or three-and-a-half stars!"

2660,1,"The recent heart-breaking Terri Schiavo case in Florida highlights the importance for everyone to have a living will as well as a regular will. You can go to a lawyer, buy a standard form from a legal stationery store, or use Willmaker Plus 2005.This latest estate planning and family law software from Nolo Press is distributed by Quicken. Nolo is a company that has been publishing self-help legal books for many years, and their website provides a wealth of information. (Since I'm not a lawyer, I can't comment if their information is always accurate, but it's at least accessible to laypeople like me.)Willmaker 2005 is for more than just writing your own will. It has many other legal documents which you can fill in, print out, and sign (in front of a notary public in some cases) to make them legally binding. The estate planning section is pretty comprehensive and works in every state except Louisiana. (I wonder why.) Setting up your legal will and living trust is pretty much a hassle-free, expense-free and lawyer-free process. The other types of documents you can create with this program include responses to those dreaded debt collection notices and filing consumer complaints. This is really a ""family lawyer"" package. (Quicken used to publish their own family lawyer program but has since replaced it with Nolo's more superior Willmaker.)The software takes an interview approach. You pick a document you want to work on. It asks you a few questions and then drafts the document for you. You review the document and then print it out and follow the simple steps to make it legally binding. The ""simple steps"" often just involve you and two witnesses (including a notary public in some cases) signing the document; for simple letters such as a reply to a debt collection letter, you don't need witnesses.While it would have been a lot nicer if the program could automate things a bit more, e.g., asking who you are and then choosing the documents for you, I guess writing a will or any legal document should not be a totally brainless thing; you have to understand what it's all about and what's involved, since we are talking legally binding documents here. (Of course, you must be mentally valid in order to create a will.)The program comes with a printed user manual. While the manual is a little confusing and makes using the program look more complex than it actually is, it's nice to have printed documentation which you can refer to readily.I like the software and, being a paranoid that I am, like doing my will and doing it for free. I can also do the wills for my family.My only concern about using the software stems from this passage from the second page of the manual:""Product support (including Web update) for Quicken WillMaker Plus 2005 ends on January 1, 2006. ... Please note that legal documents created and signed before January 1, 2006 will remain legally valid and enforceable if you have used Web Update regularly. You will need to upgrade your software only if you want to create new documents or update existing documents.""Does this mean I'll need to buy a new version each and every year from now on? (I fancy my financial and family situation will change over time and thus require additions and/or amendments.) While upgrading the software still beats a trip to the attorney, it would nonetheless be quite an annoyance.(In all fairness, both Quicken and Microsoft are moving to a subscription-like model for their financial software, so I guess that's the inevitable trend.)Happy estate planning!"
74604,0,"I have used many versions of Quicken over the years, upgrading regularly, but stopped at Quicken 2002 after seeing 2003, 2004, and 2005 get panned on this site and elsewhere.However, Intuit has backed me into a corner by discontinuing support for 2002 as of April, so had to decide between this and Money, which is also universally panned. Better the devil you know that the devil you don't, so Quicken 2005 it was.Before getting into the software, let me mention that Quicken's ""sunset policy"" is garbage. It is one thing to quit supporting a product--you cannot find good people that want to help consumers with old software. However, to actually turn off functionality? That is inexcusable. If class action lawsuits were not a complete waste of time for everyone but the lawyers, I'd be out there drumming up a list of victims of this exceptionally poor business practice.That aside, on to the software itself... I originally thought it wasn't that bad.I have over fifty different accounts, including banking, loans, investment, 401(k), etc., etc., and they all upgraded perfectly. I was also given the option to merge my linked investment and cash accounts, which simplifies tracking (a nice new feature for those of us who are not hardcore accountants).The user interface is slightly different than previously, but not radically so, and allows more flexible customization. With very little effort, I was able to get rid of most of the annoying ""buy our products"" links Intuit insists on including.However, a month of use has brought forth some problems that are making me strongly consider going back to a spreadsheet. Some examples:--There are a number of hard-coded rules to prevent you from doing something Quicken does not think is a good idea. For example, it is not possible to transfer securities from one account to another at all unless the accounts are of the same type-if not, as in the case of transfer from an ESPP account to a normal brokerage account, you need to ""sell"" the shares, then transfer the proceeds, then ""buy"" the shares in the destination account. I would say that rules out the possibility of using Quicken for tax purposes.--Upgraded 401(k) accounts for those accounts that do not provide the number of shares simply cease to function. The first time that you attempt to use the Update Wizard to indicate your new account value, Quicken creates COPIES of all the existing securities, appends ""-401k"" to the end, and shows double the value of the account. You cannot delete the old transactions, as you would lose all transaction history. An hour of technical support resulted in the following brilliant suggestion: ""Uninstall 2005 and reinstall your 2002 version, then re-enter all the transactions in the account (six years' worth), and upgrade again. That might solve it.""--In general, 401(k) accounts no longer provide accurate information. When updating the account from a statement, Quicken no longer creates automatic buys based on your new balance. Instead it creates bizarre ""placeholder entries"" that show that on Day X, you owned Y shares of something, but not how the shares got there. Apparently, it is intended that the user now goes back and manually creates the buy transactions that were created automatically in the past.--When attempting a download from my bank, every transaction that I had before the upgrade to 2005 comes back over and over again. For example, I attempted to download my bank transactions from the past month and received every transaction since the account was opened. Hoping for a one-time glitch (surely once I cleared them out it would not happen again!), I spent a half hour right-clicking and deleting the duplicate transactions. On my next download request, all 487 of them came back.--If you hold shares in an ESPP account, the name of the security has ""ESPP"" appended to the end of it, so it is treated as a different security than any shares of the same actual stock you may already hold (even if the shares are in the same account, and were placed there before an upgrade). So instead of showing 1000 shares of XYZ, you get 500 shares of XYZ and 500 shares of XYZ ESPP.In summary, Intuit has extorted their customers into upgrading. Having done so, they did not fix any of the obvious software problems (why does the cash flow forecast choke when one has too many schedule transactions, but is perfectly happy to estimate how much money you will be spending???). At the same time, they introduced a number of rather obvious bugs. They provide pay-only support (other than for a very limited number of issue types that they will address on Web Chat if you live in the Pacific Time Zone or are willing to work on your problem at night). The consistent approach to support is ""uninstall the software and reinstall it and re-enter all your work.""This is a very, very poor piece of software, and a very poor company. It is a shame Microsoft or someone else cannot get their act together and make something better. A spreadsheet or pen/paper would be better than this."

25847,1,"First of all, I would like to say that I am rather experienced computer professional. ... I really do have to say that Symantec's support STINKS. I agree with all of you there. But there is nothing wrong with this program. This program is VERY VERY customizable, and often you need to do a little customizing, and some people are not familiar and or comfortable with that. I say to them, then find someone who knows what they are doing to help you install it and set it up, or leave it on the shelf and go play solitaire. I am sorry if you feel I am slamming you, but nobody said that configuring rules for how your internet works should be cake-work. Just be glad that Symantec actually makes it possible and reliable, so it takes a few days to get it right ... isn't your safety worth a little bit of effort and maybe a couple emails for help? Please people, you give these programs a bad review, then thousands of people run to the competitors, and they are worse, and then they will write bad reviews, next thing we know these products wont be on the market because everyone is too scared to go buy it thinking that it doesn't work. Really, if you have questions, email me, I would be more than glad to help you and see you satisfied with another fine Norton program from Symantec."

Far superior to its competition. ....But this upgrade is little more than an enhanced maintenance release. There are an even dozen useful language improvements -- most of which should have been incorporated into the language years ago.There are some new development interface features that may aid development speed. Most of these (i.e. IntelliSense) have been available for years from third parties -- usually free.This release falls far short of a major upgrade to the language. Bill Gates must need the money.

At first glance you can easily see that the kids look like they're 5 years older. Also, when playing you're first game the gameplay is quick and it might take a game or two to get used to. When you start you are also not in the traditional clubhouse start menu. There are secret rinks, coaches, and players (Possibly Mario or Lindros?)which you can earn. The players include Curtis Joseph, Martin Brodeur, Jarome Jagr, Mike Modano, Jarome Iginla, Paul Kariya, Joe Thornton, Steve Yzerman, Joe Sakic, and ,urs truly, Brian Leetch of the Rangers.

Now she's going after treasures from around the world, faster than you can say, &quot;Stop!&quot; You're now an agent for The ACME Detective Agency. Your job is to track Carmen Sandiego's cohorts around the globe, using the Get-A-Clue-Case Pad. This device enables you to: Question tourists, access the World Wiz DataBase, travel around the world, create a profile of your thief, and contact The Chief. First, you must install the program. In the user's manual, you will find detailed instructions on how to do this, on either Macintosh, or Windows. After you have successfully installed the wonderful game, start it. First, enter your name. Then, The Chief will contact you, and give you the scoop on working for ACME, and how to catch a thief, in a nutshell. Then, you can start your first case. You will Fly By Night Travel to your destination. There are 50 countries where the thief could have gone. You are going to one of them. When you arrive, you should start off by questioning tourists. Using your gadgetry, ask them a question, either about where the crook went next, or what the suspect looks like. They will reply. Their text will come up on the screen. To record this on your yellow note pad, just drag their text onto the note pad. It will automatically be recorded. Pick up any scraps of paper, or suspicious items that are lying around. These are clues to what your suspect looks like. Each clue points to a certain trait. Enter this trait in the Digisketch function. When you have all the traits, you can obtain a warrant. Go to your next place, by clicking on the globe icon. You will have several choices. Pick the one that every location clue that you've recieved points to. If you need to navigate, use the arrows next to the picture of the world, to turn the picture. Find the country. Put the cursor on each red dot, and the country that that is will be highlighted. When you find yours, start navigating. When you have an answer, click on either the name of the country, or the country's red dot. Be sure it's the right country! You will soon advance through the ranks. From Rookie, all the way up to Super Sleuth! You must catch 39 crooks, before you can even try to catch Carmen. As you move up in rank, the cases become longer, and more difficult. Use any reference that you need. It's fun to view every part of the country. You can view the full 350 degrees, if you like. Each picture of each country is beautifully painted, with elaborate details. If you really like the picture, or just want to know where you are, take a look at your map, in the right-hand corner. It will display the country, and tell you what city you're in, and where the city is in the country. Enjoy each scene, and the music from the country. Have fun with the game, and Good Luck! I hope that you liked my review, and maybe even considered buying the product!"

80574,1,"This is an absolutely wonderful-looking office suite from Apple. For a few months, it was the best you could get for your Mac, especially the new Intel macs.But as of last week's release of MS Office 2008 for Mac, iWork returns to second place in the Office Feature set. There is nothing here that isn't outdone by MS Office 08.What iWork continues to excel at is the interface, and the mac-centricity of the program -- everything looks and feels like all your other familiar Mac programs.For those who have been reared on MS Word and Excel, there is no comparison, however.The one downside of iWorks -- you can not natively save programs to .doc or .xls format. You need to ""export"" each document you want to share with your PC-office co-workers. This adds an extra step to every save...eventually you stop doing so and hope that nobody wants any of your files...and when you do need to share them you need to convert all of them.I installed MS Office 2008 the day it was released, and found myself having to convert hundreds of Pages documents to use them back in Office -- a royal pain, and really one of the reasons that iWork is now banished tot he Application folder. I dare not delete it from my harddrive for fear that I will have files I saved in iWork format that can't be converted in Word....there's the rub -- you MUST convert files using Pages or Numbers, you can NOT convert anything inside MS Office basically meaning you have to keep two office suites on your hard drive.The other serious (not yet fixed despite being out 6 months) flaw in Pages is the drop color problem -- if using shadowing around photo-image boxes the program changes the colors of your photos on the page. There is no work around for this other than to save the entire document as a PDF, open in Text Editor, re-save it as a JPG, and and then print. This affects all macs across the board. Graphic Designers beware.My Timeline....up until iWork 08 was released, MS Office 2004 for Mac was the Suite of Choice....then for about 6 months iWork 08 was the clear leader...now with the release of MS Office 2008, there really is no comparison and MS Office 08 wins in the full-feature-full-compatibility realm."

39340,2,"Though somewhat juvinile I found the game still enjoyable. It was challenging sometimes because it was genuinally difficult to do some of the thing that needed to be done, and other times it was because they didn't explain well enough what you had to do in certain situations. Because of that, I recomend that everyone new to the game look at control settings to find out what moves this cat has up his hat. One of the reasons I enjoyed the game is because I enjoyed the movie. Although not in a story mode, it was still fun to chase Quinn out of every corner of the mutant house. However I must warn some people that the extra points are not just bonuses. Sometimes you will need a certain amounts of points if you want to continue the game, plus if you get all the points out of a level, that part of the house goes back to normal. For boss lovers I'm sorry to say that their are only two of them. That's why I think that the Cat in the Hat is a mixed bag."
85215,1,"In this game you can adopt your own Catz at the adoption center. Once you do that, you start taking care of them! Remember to feed them, play with them, and wash them every day! Be cautious, don't mistreat them, or they may run away! You will know they have ran away if you come to select them and there' s a big, red RUNAWAY across his/her picture. When you click on them, something will say, ""Your pet has run away! Wait and they may come back!"" However, one of my pets ran away and they never came back.Your petz will remain kittenz for 3-4 days, and then the day will come when they grow up! They can then have kittenz! To have kittenz, you need a male and a female pet that LIKE each other. If they don't like each other, you will have to take sprays at them with the love spray or play some love songs so they will fall in love. You will know when they have fallen in love when they jump to the middle of the screen and a big red heart comes up saying they are expecting kittenz. What you have to do then is (if you haven't already) take care of your petz, come back the next day, and the next day, make sure to play with your petz! They should then have kittenz the next day.When your petz have kittenz, you need to take the female out at the right time, then the playscene will turn into the nursery playscene, and a certificate will come up showing your new kittenz. Name them, click OK, and you'll be in the nursery where you can visit your Kittenz whenever you want by taking out the mother Cat, and you'll automatically go to the nursery. You cannot take out or put back Petz in the nursery; not even the father. I think that's kind of weird. To exit the nursery, just go to a seperate Playscene.

17172,1,"I've been using Virtual PC for about six months now and I am satisfied. I use Virtual PC to run Microsft Money and QuickBooks on a G5 with 1GB of RAM, of which 700MB is allocated to Virtual PC.Using an emulator can be slow. But I've found that if you use one program at a time, it responds well. In other words, if you stay in Quickbooks and don't swap over to AppleMail, Safari, etc, the program running in the emulator works reasonably well.Surprisingly, I haven't run across any Windows issues. Installation of Virtual PC and Windows XP, Money and Quickbooks all occurred without any concerns. I have not experienced any BSDs (Blue Screens of Death) or any other hang ups.When running Virtual PC, the G5 will not go into sleep mode. So, if you leave your G5 running all day and night like I do, the energy savings mode will not kick in.If you need to run more complex programs in Virtual PC, I suggest that you max out the RAM at 2GB and devote as much as possible to the Virtual PC.One minor annoyance is that when swapping between programs, sometimes it take Virtual PC a long time to respond. So say you are working in Safari and you then move into Virtual PC. It can sometimes take 15-20 secs before Virtual PC responds.UPDATE One annoying issue that presents itself too often is this: buttons go black. By buttons, I mean things that you click to get the program to respond. Once the buttons go black, they still operate (i.e. click on one to, say, maximize a window, and it does. The only way to get this to stop happening, is to restart Windows. Usually, this only happens after having Virtual PC running for a while. But, it is incredibly annoying because restarting Windows and Quickbooks probably takes a full ten minutes."
91743,1,"I am a long time user of PaperPort. I started with version 9, I believe, and took my time to upgrade to 11 pro. I can't say is has been the best behaved on my Win XP sp3 computer (HP laptop, 1.5GB ram, AMD Turion64-not the strongest computer), but it seems that all the Windows XP updates have helped make it very stable and quiet fast. I also own Adobe Acrobat 9 Professional and was using that to do most of my scanning. But yesterday, I stated scanning some old woodworking magazines-many pages and some low in contrast. I was using Acrobat, which has been really great for most of the jobs I had done, but I was having trouble with image quality at 100 dpi, plus, I was having to do way too many clicks for each additional page scan. I decided to open PP11 Pro and use it. Wow! Was I surprised. The scanner interface (I use a Visioneer OneTouch 9320 scanner) was so much better and the file handling was tons easier. Yes, I don't know Acrobat really well but I have tried to enhance image quality, etc. many a time over the last year and can't do it in Acrobat, but PP11 is a snap! Plus, the dual pane interface is truly wonderful for moving documents and pages around. It is the by far the easiest way I have found to work medical insurance claims and organize almost a 1000 pages of PDF scans of my medical records when I retired from the USAF. Bottom line - I can't live without PP11 Pro and it sounds like I made the correct decision not to upgrade to PP12 Pro.If you can, get your hands on PP11 Pro and use it - you'll learn to love it!"

18334,1,"This is fun game and easy to use. Any child who likes animals will ove it. You not only get to rescue the animals on a little search and find but you bring them back to the center and name them, grrom them , play games with them. If you do well at the games, the animal often performs a little trick. It includes a nice variety of pets, kittens, puppies, rabbits, turtles, hamsters, birds."
72088,1,"I am a previous Norton user, and selected this product for my new computer based on reviews read on the internet. I have been completely happy with this product. I particularily like the feature of receiving notices that updates are available. One click, and my program is updated. Twice this week it stopped Sobig, one of the big viruses currently infecting computers nationwide, and automatically deleted the infected email. I purchased from amazon.com and was very pleased with the experience."
63458,1,"I bought Studio AV/DV Version 9 with an analog / digital (firewire) capture card. Contrary to most DVD programs I've seen, the program is very intuitive. It is organised around around three major themes: video capture, scene editing, and burning. The video capture is great; for analog video, just turn on the capture and hit play on the VCR or video camera. For digital video using the firewire interface, it is even easier; the video camera's control are simulated on the screen, just hit &#34;play&#34;. The captured video is automatically captured as an AVI file (13GB per hour).The video is automatically parsed into different sequences, based on scene changes. So, the second part of the program, video editing, is very easy - just pick the sequences you want drag them around, cut the beginning or the end, etc. You can add menus and overlay sounds; all this is very easy, but here you run into one of the first problems with this program: it is quite slow. I am running it on an AMD 1500 and adding a menu is point and wait and click and wait. You can also autmatically turn all the sequences into chapters, so the viewer can skip along sequences by pressing the &#62;&#62;| symbol of the remote control.Once the project is finished, you can write it to a file or to a disc. You can pick the audio format (mpeg is smaller), pick the file size or the file quality (one adjusts the other), write a disc image to burn later, etc. I haven't run into the lack of a feature yet.However, Version 9 consistently crashed after anywhere from 5 minutes to two hours. I downloaded the 50MB of Version 9.3 and reinstalled it, and it still occasionally crashed. I turned off the network and went into the control panel, services tables, and turned off everything having to do with networks or printers and everything else that seemed superfluous, and got it to work that way. Still, rendering (from AVI to MPEG) takes forever. One video, with one menu, 34 chapters (all sequences), no audio overlay, took 54 hours to render. Two days!I would also highly recommend a separate hard disk, with lots of spare room. Put the second hard disk on the second IDE controller."
1791,0,"This is my first GPS product, so I don't have much to compare to. It is what you would expect from Microsoft, it does basic functions but is unintuitive and poorly designed. I purchased the product to use on vacation from LA to Las Vegas. I had a passenger running the laptop while I drove. It got me to where I was going, especially after I got used to audible directions (like judging how far .2 miles is and the audio glitch of ""take tram left"" means take next ramp left). If you went past your turn, it took S&T; a minute to regenerate new directions. Every time we powered the laptop down, it would loose the communications port and we had to refind through the control panel new hardware screen. This is a very mediocre product, so typical of Microsoft, but, compared to hand held devices, the price is nice. This is why I'll raise it from 2 to 3 stars.Added your own points is cumbersome and hard to figure out without reading the instructions (a big strike for me). It did have some cute feature like telling your altitude, MPH and time to destination. The streets were quite detailed, including a national park in Nevada.This is a very mediocre product, so typical of Microsoft, but, compared to hand held devices, the price is nice. This is why I'll raise it from 2 to 3 stars."

That's what made me buy this software. I own a Sony Digital Studio and can make all the DVD's I want to. I wanted to make VCD's for some of the less important things because CD's are so cheap. So I bought this software thinking I'd be all set. I installed the software and clicked ""make movie"" and then it tells me that I need a plug-in (that I have to buy) to make a VCD. What?!?!?! I just spent [a lot] for some software that says it makes VCD's and I have to shell out another [significant amount] to actually make it work. This, needless to say, irks me."

64905,1,"I've used the 'real' Photoshop for a number of years professionally but was hesitant to pay the 'real' Photoshop price for home use. Elements 3 lacks the bells and whistles and uses some 'short cuts' that seem to me kind of crude but for 90% of folks E3 is more than adequate. I am very happy with E3. (Beware of what rebates maybe offered by Adobe, however. If offered, read the 'fine print' if there is fine print. I felt mislead but Amazon 'made good.')"

10915,1,"This product is good from beginning to end. If students use the software as a study tool, the student may improve their knowledge in Algebra 2. I purchase this product for my son. It assisted him in learning topics needed for class. If students are self-learners then this is perfect, but if the student need further assistance then this product may help or may not if face to face help is required. The reason, I give this four stars, is because the animation needs work, it is a traditional format without the bells and whistle. Some students need the animated stimulation, and this product is an early edition of computer programming. So take care in your decision to purchase, this one of the situations where you get what you pay for, but the content is worthwhile. Assessments are included as well for practice."
9219,0,"After trying the free trialware version I bought a copy of this program on Ebay for about $10, for that price it has done its job. As with other reviewers, there just isnt a central file or somewhere that you can see your passwords on, like a spreadsheet. One change I would make in this program is that it assumes that you only have 1 account on every webpage. yes the program allows for several user profiles however, if for example, you have 2 yahoo email accounts, it will only allow 1 password per page per profile. otherwise you would have to manually type in the second account each time which defeats the purpose of the program."
87955,2,"This is my first experience with dictation software, so I don't have anything to compare it to. All I can do is offer observations on how this one has worked for me.Training this software takes quite a long time; a few hours if you want to get maximum performance. I actually wouldn't mind so much, except that you need to retrain it every time you buy a new microphone or work in an environment with a different sound level. For me, this has meant having to train the software several times. Reading the provided material so the software can sample your voice is actually kind of fun, but after you've done it a few times (reading the same passages to train for different microphones or environments), it is exceptionally tedious. I wish they had provided a larger selection of reading material.The headphones which come with the software are adequate, but I heard you can get better recognition with a higher quality set. (I upgraded to a Plantronics Audio 90, which is better, but not one I'd recommend.)My biggest complaint about the software is that it consumes a tremendous amount of system resources on your computer. I can not be running any other programs at the same time, or it crashes. I am using a computer with a 1.40 GHz Centrino processor with 512MB of RAM. Even when I am running only IBM ViaVoice and MS Word, I clearly run into performance issues. After a while my computer starts to bog down and I have to restart it. My computer's specs are way above what IBM recommends, so that *shouldn't* have been an issue. If a beefier computer would solve my problems, I think IBM should specify ""minimal"" and ""optimal"" system requirements. I don't mind if a program is a system hog if the developer is willing to *admit* it and tell me what I need.More complaints: ViaVoice types with unusual quirks which it seems would have been easy for IBM to have prevented. For example, it often fails to capitalize the first word in a sentence, especially when dictating in chat software. When you dictate for a passage to be in quotation marks, it leaves a space between the quotation marks and the words inside the quote. For some words, it seems impossible to get the software to recognize that you are dictating a word, and not issuing a command.IBM's ViaVoice is considerably cheaper than the competition. Unfortunately, I have no idea if the higher price of the competing product (Dragon) is justified by being a higher-quality product. ViaVoice is probably adequate for most casual dictating needs. If you've never used dictation software before, it's really impressive the way it can usually understand what you're saying. The more you use it, the better it gets at recognizing what you are saying, and the better you will get at enunciating in a way it can understand. After a few months of casual usage, I would say my software is hitting 90 to 95% accuracy (higher under ideal conditions with simple words).The bottom line is, for the price, this is pretty good software (though I sure do wish it was more stable). If you use dictation a lot and know that the competing products are better quality, they would be worth the price. But for a casual user, this software is fine."

19096,1,We have just returned from 2 weeks of driving in France. The European SD card with the Europe maps for our Nuvi 260 was the best travel investment we made. I was able to drive with the confidence that if lost I could count on the GPS (we nicknamed the voice Molly) to get us to our hotel or our goal that day. Also it made driving in Paris to return our car far less stressful. If you are driving in Europe I would strongly recommend one. They were offered with our rental car for an extra $20 a day so the investment in our own was worth it.Monte Montana
1765,1,"I am giving the product 5 stars, although I have never used anything to compare it to, because it does everything I want and then more. I recently used it on a trip to Colonial Williamsburg Virgina. The only problem I had was losing the GPS signal in the mountains, and it sometimes showed me off route on the west bound lanes of an interstate when going east. Again I think because of the mountains. But I think this is a problem with any land based GPS navigation product.Because a laptop can be difficult to manage in a car I would like to see upcoming streets, routes, etc announced vocally, opposed to just showing on the screen with an announcement that a turn is forthcoming at a certain distance. Not good having to look at something in the car for the turn street name, route, etc while driving.Otherwise I think it's great. I used the reroute feature once, that got me back on track while looking for a destination in Norfolk Virgina.I recommend it."
51716,1,"I've been using Family Tree Maker for many years and upgraded 4 times. It has been a good program up through FTM9 afterwhich I guess the company changed hands?. One bit of advise to genealogists out there. Many of these genealogy programs will ask you to upload your information that you worked to compile ""for everyone to use"" when they really want to take your work and sell the results for a profit. In some cases you lose the right to publish your own work if you share with them. I and many others always shared for free or cost in the past and everyone wants money now."

I thought I would go ahead and again try some of the other programs out there before upgrading.I tried two of the other programs popular on the net.

I love showing off the new ""Events"" way of organizing photos. I haven't even began to understand all the new stuff with GarageBand but it does provide a neat way to custom make your own iPhone ringtones without having to pay for them in iTunes.

84860,2,"I switched from Windows to the Mac. One of the things I was hoping to do was to switch my Quicken data to this Mac application. It took a lot of doing and after I had finished it did not seem to be worth the effort. The interface was really different. One glitch I noticed was that my loan payments were not being computed correctly. I also could not copy transactions. There were numerous other minor glitches. However, I decided to be patient, and I gave myself several months to get used to the new software. I finally gave up and purchased the 2011 version of Quicken for Windows. I run it on the Windows partition of my iMac. I should have read the reviews of the Mac version of Quicken more closely. If you are doing your finances in the Windows version of Quicken, do NOT switch to this Mac version. Stick with the Windows version of Quicken."

Activation code is 24 characters to the power of at least 36 possibilities for each, which is at least the human population of earth times 10-to-the-29th.Activation codes could mean (in my untrained mind) that you are essentially renting the product rather than buying it.

50130,0,"For a UNIX based OS, Leopard has shown me less stability than Tiger and than other high-end UNIX OS's such as PCLinuxOS and Ubuntu. I remember using Tiger for 2 yrs. before it crashed on me; Leopard took just a few days and regularly crashes critical applications (Safari, Mail, and MS Office are the usual culprits); and the OS itself takes a dive every so often too. It's surprising behavior for OS X, given my previous experience with Panther and Tiger. Nevertheless, for features and ease of use it can't be matched; and it remains the safe choice for virus-free, malware-free computing and web browsing.The big problem with Apple remains its paranoid defense of its proprietary territory and what I call ""death by a thousand charges"" -- $80 every two years or so for updates to iLife, iWork if you have it; the annual charges for the pathetic MobileMe; and the fee to get yourself to the front of the line at their genius bars. Apple was once distinguished by a community spirit, top-shelf customer service, and a departure from the corporate mob. Today, Linux is home to those virtues and Apple plays in the same moneyed muck as M$, and it shows in the quality of their products, which steadily declines with time and greed."

My son is 2-1/2 and the guidance says Ages 3-8 for this game, but I really enjoy playing it with him and teaching him to have fun ""figuring things out"". Although, I also enjoy watching him sit here at this computer (very recently) in his booster chair so he can reach the mouse comfortably and do all the moves and clicking and rescuing all by himself.

82141,1,This Hallmark Card Program was purchased as an anniversary gift from my husband because he knows I love giving Hallmark cards. I had just as much fun making the cards as I do standing in the card store reading them. My boss had a birthday which I had forgotten about and that morning I made a card quickly and used the card stock paper to print it on. Later when I told a co-worker about making the card she was amazed because it looked just like a store bought card. I wish it had more clip art but with the net that's easy to solve.
7975,1,"I really like Leopard's new look, with the iTunes-style windows, 3D dock, improved Spotlight, etc. Also, Quick Look is an amazingly useful feature that enables me to view documents without having to open their respective programs.There are also a number of setting tweaks that I really appreciate, such as the ability to share specific folders. This allows me to share certain files without having to dump them into my public folder, or provided access to my entire computer,Overall, what sold me on the OS was the fact that, despite these graphical improvements, the system itself is faster. Because its so speedy, I now use spotlight as both a file finder and an application launcher. Navigating file folders is quick, and everything from changing preferences to opening programs seems more responsive. This is no revolutionary OS like Vista, but unlike Vista, it is a solid system that improves upon the previous edition without sacrificing speed or security. I would definitely recommend it to all Mac users."
5601,1,"Do not pay attention to the reviews that say this has no educational content. The game is filled with age appropriate educational content including, sequencing, pattern recognition, color identification, attentive listening... There are many games within the game and they increase in difficulty as your child sucessfully completes them. My 4 year old daughter spends tons of time on this game (and her Putt-Putt games) and loves them all. Just like reading her favorite books again and again, she loves to play this game again and again, even though the plot of the overall game does not change. The miniature games (like helping Rose plant flowers in a certain pattern) get progressively harder and she rises to the challenge and then gets to go back to the comfort of a familiar plot. If your child went right through this then you/he/she did not click around and find all of the hidden surprises. Plaid Banana did an excellent job. Thank you Plaid Banana."
13758,0,"Free is always good especially if the firewall is ""high-rated"" by many publications. I am an old firewall ""wolf"", so I know ""ins"" and ""outs"". I installed the free version of ZA to several home and small business PCs as well as to my laptop. I did not have any problem until I have decided to install it to my own, main PC at home. The installation requests to reboot the PC. My PC is configured carefully and protected with various programs: registry cleaner, anti-spyware, anti-virus, and hardware-based firewall. It happened the first time with my PC when after reboot I've got only blinking cursor. Wow! Is that ""something"", or not? I had to power the PC down 2 times (!), booted in the Safe mode, rebooted, powered down again, and only then the XP Pro got back to normal. In spite of some booting problem (that I did not contributed to ZA at that time), after 2-3 days of functioning with ZA, I have decided to look at the buying options (eBay and Amazon - the most reasonable prices). Thanks to all reviewers, I have decided NOT to buy the product, especially because I know that the ""blinking cursor"" problem was attributed by the firewall software (and it's not a good sign), and also because it is the Check Point's product, and obviously the technical support is provided by Check Point. I know this company for a long time; I am the Check Point Certified Engineer. I highly respect the original, industrial strength Check Point's firewall (NGX, etc). The ZA is a product that was acquired recently. What I have experienced myself that Check Point's technical support s**ks big time. I assume, the same situation is with Zone Alarm, so, I'll use the free product until I will find something better or until it fails again. Maybe version 2008 will be better?"

44115,0,"Purchased this for my new laptop that only came with a trial version of MO2010. Remember when computers used to come with all the complete software you needed? Apparently, no more! I did not opt for the 2010 for a couple of reasons. 1. The company I work for uses 2007 and I wanted my documents to be compatible. 2. Everything I was reading was saying there was little difference so why pay more?I am only experiencing one problem with this purchase. It does NOT come with Microsoft Office Outlook. NO, NOT, NADA!! Why? I have no idea except that they want to make more $$ on you when you have to purchase it separately. Very disappointing as I am sure many people have need of it along with the M02010. Consider that when shopping and pricing the product.Otherwise, I do like most of the differences between the 2003 and 2007 versions. The 2007 version has more colors and options for your Excel and Power Point documents, making it easier for you to make professional quality documents. Chart templates are more advanced as well and allow you to not only make useful graphics to enhance a presentation, but also lay your information out in a manner that is easier for your viewer to understand. There is also a lot more color choices for cell shading in Excel, allowing you to separate more sections in your spreadsheets.Some people have experienced problems with the ""ribbon"" at the top that has all the tools listed. It is more picture driven than word driven so finding the tool you want to use can be a bit more tricky than before. Hovering your mouse over the picture, however, will pop up what the tool name is. Few have changed names so it really should be a non issue.The Word program works the same and probably has more things I have not explored yet. Works perfect for typing letters, lists and constructing documents that may include images as well.I have not had the opportunity to try some of the other programs included but they are the basics of MO.One other thing - if you are in the market to purchase a new computer and see a program on the display model, ask the sales associate if a new computer would come with the FULL VERSION of that program. Our new computer came with trial versions only, even though the full versions were on the displays. Could save you alot of time and $$.I do hope this review can help you make an informed decision :)"
56437,2,"Very buggy and very slow. Tested on both of my office systems. Does not backup to more than 1 volume in your DVD writer (lots of contact with NTI support, but no resolution &quot;it was my drive&quot; they said - so why is it specifically listed on their site as compatible?Most troublesome - did a backup to an extra HD on my system - that took all night to backup 20Gb!) and when I did a restore it froze after &quot;restoring&quot; for 12 hours. I am self employed and am my own IT person, so while not an expert I am a fairly advanced user (been doing this since 1984 and I have never had so much trouble and frustration). I cannot afford to loose my data, I would go out of business. So I cannot recommend this product and would advise that if you are really stuck, use the backup function in XP (it is fast - 1hr to do 20Gb and it restores perfectly - but only does backup to a HD, not a DVD writer)."

I believe the Explorer contains just the first few units.Each section consists of a series of Listening, Reading/Listening, Speaking, and Reading exercises. The full version of this software consists of 19 units of 10-12 sections each.In each exercise, you are given a series of activities consisting of a choice of four pictures and/or pieces of text and/or spoken dialogues (depending on which type of activity it is), and you must choose the correct picture/text/dialogue from the cues.The exercises are very simple, suitable for children or for quick reviews. If you are new to Arabic, or refreshing your skills after a long period of disuse, the repetition will be useful in building your vocabulary (back) up. You are fed bits of grammar incrementally with each new unit. You start with simply identifying various people and objects, and then add a few adjectives, and then add a few verbs so you are recognizing simple sentences such as ""The boy drinks some milk"" or ""The bird flies"" or ""This car is not red, it is white,"" etc. Each unit adds more pieces of grammar and more vocabulary, building up to more complex sentences, different verb tenses, and so on.However, that is as far as it can take you. Diligently practicing all the exercises should expand your vocabulary and give you basic grammatical skills in Arabic. It will not bring you to the point of being able to carry on a meaningful conversation (unless your conversations are confined to describing objects and pointing at various people and animals and stating what they are doing), nor will it enable you to, say, read a newspaper.For self-study, this software makes a good supplement to more robust texts and tapes. Don't expect it to bring you up to full proficiency. If you want to do more than recognize simple sentences and learn a lot of ""everyday vocabulary,"" Rosetta Stone is insufficient. However, I do recommend it for the crucial repetition and ""training your ear"" that every language student needs, especially those doing self-study, if you are at a low to moderate proficiency level.It is important to note that the text is entirely in Arabic script. You must be able to read Arabic before you can practice anything but the listening exercises. (Get a good book on Arabic script and learn it -- it's not that difficult, a serious student should be able to read the script fairly proficiently within a week.) Also, there are no English translations at all. This is not a bad thing -- the way the information is presented, you are expected to pick up the meaning as you go along, and if you practice the exercises seriously, you will. Just be aware that this software is based on the Audio-Lingual method, so you will find no glossaries or explanations of grammar."

63011,1,"I love the improvements to OS X but I do have a few issues.First is that I had to go back and dig up my old OS X.3 disks to reinstall Classic. This is no big deal but I thought it was odd that this was not included. (I did a clean install)Also, and this is a big gripe, I lost Quicktime Pro. I had the old version of Quicktime Pro and when Quicktime 7 was installed I lost the editing abilities I had already paid for and there is no discount on buying Quicktime 7 Pro. This is really a pain. Especially because the full program is actually included you just need the code to activate the Pro features. My old code will not work I tried.I took me a while to go back and install the software I had on the old OS X but it's was worth it. If you are planning on doing a clean install be sure to download Backup from Apple and copy all your photos, music, etc. to a CD or DVD (of course you do this regularly anyway right).My favorite features are the Dashboard and Searchlight. I use my computer for research a lot and the ability to search inside the .pdf files on my computer is a great feature. Dashboard is just cool.The RSS feature on Safari is great also. I set up the RSS feed screen saver so now instead of just looking at pretty pictures I can scan the latest info on the sites I view regularly without even touching the computer.The tighter integration between iCal Address Book and Mail is also useful. I did have a 3rd party app to put all the birthdays in my Address Book into my iCal but now this is built in and built in is alwats better than add-on.Wishes? I wish that Searchlight could find and index text in Word and Pages documents. I have to work with Word .doc a lot to deal with PC users and this would be helpful. A quick word about Pages. It is a great word prossesser. The ability to export my work as either a Word document or a .pdf is outstanding. I bought MS Office before Pages was available and now it seems a waste of money. I find Pages easier to use and rarely use the featuers of MS Office such as Powerpoint (especially now that I have Keynote) or Excel.So there you have it. Is this upgrade a must have. No, I guess not. But it is awfully useful. If I had to chose one over the other I would buy iWork first, but I am very glad I have both."
53840,1,"This package of software and books is a must for those just getting into backyard astronomy. The software, for example, tells you precisely where a sky object -- such as a planet or star -- is in the sky, based on your actual location and time of day. You simply go outside and point your telescope where Starry Night says the object will be and go from there. And that's just the beginning of what the software can do. The entry-level astronomy book that comes with the package is also excellent."

94355,1,"This is the first time I have used TurboTax. I had trouble with Mutual Funds and went to a professional tax preparer for the last three years. I was anticipating difficulty with it and had some anxious moments, but it turned out beautifully. I got more money back in refunds than I ever had. I felt I had to sign up for Audit Protection because TurboTax sent so much back. The one problem I had was that I didn't know where to enter charitable donations."
24494,1,"I was very happy with this game- it took the bets parts of the previous Oregon Trail incarnations and wove them together for a good overall product. I can appreciate a company which recognizes both the weaknesses and the strengths of their products and uses this information to get better. In this Oregon Trail you can once again chose how many you will travel with and name them (for some crazy reason this feature was eliminated in the 4th Oregon Trail edition), but you can also CHOOSE the times you stop to collect wild fruit or fish, instead of these circumstances just happening randomly (which does not make as much sense). To me, these were the biggest changes to previous games, but they were improvements.Aside from the above changes, the basics of the game remain the same, and it will look familiar to those who have played other editions. A few things have been updated, particularly some aspects concerning Native Americans and some geography, but the good times still keep rolling."
28763,2,I tried to use this software on a system running windows 98. I had problems using my modem for dial up networking after sending a fax. The only way around it was to restart the computer. The box claims windows 98 compatibility but nowhere in the product manual or online help does it mention it. It also claims to come on CD-ROM. My original order and replacement order arrived as 3.5 floppies. My opinion is that this is just a repackaged product that may have worked with Win/95 or NT. I wasted a lot of valuable time trying to get it to work.Don't waste yours!
16014,1,"I love this software. It's got everything you really need if you're a prosumer. You can start doing really complex techniques in about 10 mins. If you've ever used Acid for music, then it will be a breeze for you. It's the exact same system, except for video."
74962,1,"First, Chinese is a very difficult language no matter where you start. I'm not sure I'd recommend this for a complete beginner like a child. We prefer Betterchinese.com for learners who want to start the language in the same way children learn to speak a native language. Nonetheless, our family enjoys foreign languages. Once we learn basic greetings, colors, numbers, etc. from a child's language source, we then use Rosetta Stone products to progress further. We've used Rosetta Stone for Chinese & Spanish. After Rosetta's Spanish I & II which took our 7 year old about a year to complete, she can converse with native Spanish speakers on a lower level basis. The Chinese language is much more difficult. It took us about 15 tries to accomplish just lesson 1. I'm predicting we'll finish level 1 in about 18 to 24 months. But we can now greet a native Chinese speaker and impress them with knowing how to count, colors, food, and many nouns. We can't speak to them in just Chinese, however."
27666,1,"I am almost 13 years old and I LOVED THIS GAME!!!! The moment you start, you get to solve puzzles and learn a lot about Marie Antonette. The whole mystery is based about her and what happened to her. You get to do so much in this game from getting to go to a secret garden and even getting to sneak into a library that holds many secrets.I have only played four Nancy Drew games and this is my favorite. The detail is so AMAZING and the graphics are great which many people are looking for these days. I recommend you get this one because you'll have so much fun and it is perfect for people who love doing detective work. It is full of surprises like never before. My friend and I played this one together and we were shocked at the end. 5 stars is perfect for this!"
30157,1,"This is an ancient version, and even though it says it is compatible with Vista, they are referring to the original Vista which did not stay around very long. We had to find an ancient PC to run it... but that said, our 2-1/2 year old loves it! He turns the computer on by himself, starts the program, and plays it on his own for a reasonable period of time (great for us in the midst of a frigid winter!). There is a great compatibility checker at selectsoft.com (PC, search for product name). Check your PC by going to Computer - System Properties. If you order an incompatible product, you are on your own regardless of ""bad"" info on the product. (sad face)"
53500,1,"I recently purchased this program and I was able to use most of the functions without reading the instruction manual. It practically loaded and started itself. Overall, I am very impressed. The only thing that I still find confusing is cabinet design and trying to do a walk-thru of the final design. I better read the book again. I'm a beginner and I would recomend this program for anyone who likes to play around with home design and remodeling ideas."
72592,0,"GoBack is great! GoBack ain't-so-great! Pick one now, and you'll agree with the other choice later...I teach Quality Assurance Testing software for a living. I've been using GoBack to revert my drives after classes so I don't have to uh, go back and reset all the program options and databases.Three problems I've had with GoBack: 1) creating music CD's, 2) GoBack doesn't tell you how much free space you have remaining in its ""History"" before it starts overwriting older data.Number three, you ask? A high potential for having to rebuild your entire operating system if you pick a ""System Safe Point"" and the GoBack fails.If the point you attempt to revert to is more than six days old, you're probably in for a rude surprise. Pick a bad point, and you could doing a total rebuild of your system and all your software from scratch! Oh, and you'll find yourself wishing you'd made those back-ups you've been putting off.GoBack keeps a history. It can store up to 2 Gigabytes of sector changes. The list continues to grow, making you THINK you can still revert to way-back-when.GoBack lacks any form of ""Guage"" by which you can tell when you're close to running-out of room in the history space. The GoBack log still holds ALL of the human-readable history since the last time you cleared it.So you pick a point to which you'd like to revert. GoBack reboots and then cranks, and cranks, and cranks. Looks good. Eighty-percent. Ninety percent. Then GoBack tells you something like: ""Gosh, golly, gee! We know it was in your list, but Buddy... we've lost the data and can not continue. Wanna try a different useless ""System Safe Point"" and see if it works? We can't tell you if it will, but go ahead, YOU make a guess and we'll give it another shot! Are ya feeling lucky, Kid?""Not to mention that when I try to record an audio CD while GoBack is running, the resultant CD reminds one of the old days of vinyl records. Lots of clicks-and-pops. Hope you have a spare hard drive you can swap-in (sans GoBack) so you can make CD's. If you turn GoBack off to burn CD's, you lose ALL your ""history!""Nice idea, this GoBack-stuff. Great start for a ""Beta"" product. Poor ""Quality Control,"" lack of thought on important issues. And a false sense of security for the uninitiated user.To it's credit: GoBack HAS allowed me to revert a file to what it looked like before I screwed it up (kind-of like Source Code Control without the expense). It's saved me time-and-again when a piece-of-crap software package I've installed has taken control of my system (e.g. ZoneAlarm Pro). It lets me see what files get changed when I do some specific task, or when I install a program.GoBack does have value.Buy it. Use it. DON'T trust it more than six days back.Make back-ups of all your important data. Frequently. Or at the very least: just before you attempt to Go Back."
88677,1,"I LOVE this interactive CD. My 8 year old son has autism. The wonderful graphics and animation has captured his interest in wanting to read, whereas, it is difficult.Also, he is able to relate to what he does in school to the CD. They all sit in circle and Arthur and his friends sit in circle, too.These are simple sight words that they use and we are very pleased with this product. This makes learning FUN!And, when the sentence is read, it is hi-lighted so you know what is being read. It is a great visual product for a visual learner! NICE!I am going to be sure to inform my school about this! Since a lot of our kids with autism are great on the computer, I hope school will be able to use this with him as well... Wonderful creative learning."
43195,0,"I was disappointed in Microsoft's new Office suite. Although there were some significant additions that made it easier to add graphics, the simpler operations seemed to be changed in ways which left users of earlier versions wondering. For example, one should be able to expect that if you click on ""Save As"" an opportunity would immediately appear to designate the name under which the file is to be saved as well as the drive. No such procedure is apparent. It took me a number of false tries over several days before I was able to achieve the desired result.Downward compatibility requires a download of a special converter program. To use a new or modified version of an Excel file produced with the new Office software in an older version of Excel requires the file to be converted first. This sounds like downward compatibility was just an afterthought.Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007"
71422,1,I read many reviews from different sources including PC World magazine which gave Adobe high marks for this product. I find it fairly easy to understand and use and it has many features as well as compatability with other Adobe products such as Photoshop Elements 4.0.
12085,0,"WindowsXP was one of the most anticipated upgrades in computer history, but much like many other things Microsoft related, this product has proven to be more trouble than it is help.There's alot of good to be said about XP Pro. Bootup times are much quicker than any other MS operating system, better user management than Windows 2000, and lots of compatability. My favorite feature has to be the automatic recognition of Plug-n-play devices, which has served as a life saver in quick situations. For those who like a PC with a nice interface, XP has unlimited skinning properties, which is good. But they take up extra RAM, which is bad. Crashes are also down as well, which is good.XP Pro has a ton of features that come automatically enabled. I can't list how many of these I've just turned off because they just plain didn't serve a purpose or were an annoyance. The IP addresser of the windows XP messenger has become a haven for spammers. The &quot;services&quot; that windows automatically enables do nothing more than take up RAM and slow you down. The System Restore will eat a big chunk of your PC if you don't know how to turn it down/off. The CD burning feature is tricky and pointless. I see no reason why you would use this over a commerical product such as Nero (or even a free CD burning program, such as Burn At Once).This is all not mentioning the numerous security holes in the operating system. Microsoft tries to fix this my automatically running Windows update while you're online. If you have a fast PC and broadband, then you might not notice it going. But if you're on an older PC or have dial-up, then it will cut into your internet speeds and processor speeds. If you turn it off, then you have to remember to check it on your own.I also can't count the numer of times I've gotten phone calls asking me how to put My Computer and My Documents back on the desktop, since they're hidden by default.All in all, it's nice, but unless you're going to have a &quot;computer person&quot; install and tweak it for you, you're going to have things happen that you don't like. Stick with 2000 until longhorn comes out."

63494,0,"It sounded good and I truly like playing mahjong-however, this version does not give enough tips on strategys. Got to level 5 and at that point the game never changed layouts-it was set to defeat the player-2 pieces show up in exactly the same spots each time-spots than cannot be played together within the games own rules-therefore, I found it disappointing."
82370,1,"I was a little hesitant to buy DirectRoute after all of the negative reviews about copy protection. I bought it anyway and received version 1.00a. Magellan must have fixed the problem with not being able to use a CD ROM burner drive to install the program because it worked just fine for me. It still requires you to have the CD in the drive to use the program however. All of that being said, this is a huge improvement over Mapsend Streets and Destinations. Every road in my immediate area that was inaccurate with Mapsend was fixed in DirectRoute. In addition, the auto-routing is very easy use and I have had excellent results with it. 4 out 5 stars - copy protection hassles remove one star."
31635,1,"When I was installing this product, I had a few of the problems that are described above. Fortunately, I found a FAQ on the norton site on how to get around these issues.When it was completely installed, I've got to say I was quite impressed with it's capabilities. The fact that it scans ALL incoming web pages is impressive. As you can imagine, my 1.7 Ghz Celeron couldn't keep up. So, my web pages were loading about 30% slower. Oh well, just an excuse to go pay $2OO to get a new P4 3.2Ghz CPU.So, in short this 2005 version will protect you from viruses even more, but it may also slow down your computer.I've not tried it yet w/ XP SP2, and would be interested to hear people's comments on that."

78547,1,"Microsoft's Virtual Globe is better than an actual globe, in my opinion, because it lets the user actually zoom into a particular area of the world, and gert facts on the country of city. It even lets one access the web for information it can't provide. I've used it on many occasions to help write a report, find out stats or just for leisure. It comes equipped with a virtual flight program, so the user can &quot;fly&quot; over a certain area. It is very helpful."

However, thanks to my Magellan gps and Mapsend Streets, I never found myself wondering around aimlessly. It may have even saved me from some serious harm a time or two.Good stuff. Buy it with confidence!"
59335,1,"I bought this for a seven year old who can spot ""educational"" games a mile away. (He is also special needs but is a visual-spatial learner). I told him that this was a ""learning"" game but he should give it a chance.He loves this game, which honestly surprised me!The game starts with Reader Rabbit and Sam (the Lion) entering a boat race. Due to a storm they crash on an island. A parrot they know comes along and plans to help them find pieces to build a new boat, but she warns them to watch out for the Pi-RATs who like to steal boat pieces and tickle wrecked passengers with pillow feathers!Once the premise of the game is set the program gives you a map of the island. The child then gets about four or five choices at a time. Each place they click on the map has a learning game. If they complete the game they get another piece for the boat.One thing that is great about this program is the ADAPT technology. The game moves with the child so if they struggle with ordinal numbers, but do really well in fractions, the fraction problems get harder but the ordinal numbers stays at the same difficulty.Some of the Games:Fractions: This is a very cute game where you have to help the Parrot make a Pizza. Monkeys come and give a specific order, such as pizza with 2/3 spiders. The child has to choose the appropriate number of slices to cut the pizza into, the right bug, and how many of each bug.Greater/Less Than: This game has the Pi-RATs trying to get onshore by climbing in barrels. The child has to shoot water balloons at the ""right"" barrels to keep the Pi-RATS from making it on shore. The Parrot may say, ""The Pi-RATs are hiding in barrels with numbers less than 4, or in barrels with numbers between 18 and 20""Addition/Subtraction: This game has Sam (the lion) swimming down a river trying to catch fish. Each fish is labeled with numbers. There is a problem at the top of the screen such as __ + ___ = 9. The child has to catch two fish that add up or subtract to equal the number.Number Lines: This game has Sam trying to dig for buried treasure on a mining cart. The child moves Sam to the appropriate numbers and then digs.100's, 10's, & 1's: This game has three sets of monkeys sitting with a banana pile. The first monkey eats 100 bananas at a time (hardest level), the second monkey 10 at a time, and the third 1. If Sam says we need 37 Bananas, the child must choose the ""10"" monkey to eat 3 piles of bananas, and the ""1"" monkey to eat 7.Telling Time: This game has Sam trying to trick the Pi-RATs into thinking their shift is over by changing the clock to match the time to ""Walk the Plank"", etcMoney: In this game Sam gets trapped in a ""tourist-trap."" In order to be let out the parrot must pay the right amount of money. The child is offered dimes, nickels, and pennies (easy level) and given an amount needed, such as $0.18.Geometry: This game has Sam helping the child make ""sails"" for the boat by cutting the appropriate shapes. Sometimes he gives a picture of a shape the child has to draw (child is given a square grid) or he may give half of the shape and the child has to finish the other half.There are many more games and we are only a third through the program so far.Likes:*The program adapts to the child's learning ability in each individual subject.*The games are actually fun and engaging*The program has a very engaging story line*After each lesson (even if the child leaves the lesson a little early) the child earns points. This is good because it provides motivation and if the child does 2 problems he gets points for the 2 problems instead of having to get through all 5 problems. The next time he logs into that game he picks up where he left off.*If the child makes a mistake the game does not ""punish"" the child as some other learning games do by pushing them back a level or taking away points. Rather, the game says ""oops"" or ""I don't think so."" The child can complete the game and the ADAPT technology moves the child up and down according to their learning level.Dislikes:*I don't know if this is so much a dislike, but this game does not necessarily ""teach"" the concepts it more reinforces them. So, there will not be an explanation of how to set the hands on the clock. This is not a bad thing if this is used to reinforce school work, but don't expect your child to ""learn"" first grade math with this alone.We like this program so much that I am going to buy the Reader Rabbit 1st & 2nd grade Reading."

42425,1,"The product arrived very quickly, in good condition and worked perfectly. It has a lot of new features which are amazing, but going to take a long time to get used to. I particularly have trouble with the changes on the task bar and wish there was an option to have legacy task bar."
65883,1,My 4 year old loves to play this game. I really like the ADAPT technology that allows you to determine where your child should start and track their progress. Great game!
22497,1,"I can't understand the bad rap Quicken 2004 is getting here. I have used Quicken for almost 20 years and this upgrade was both smooth and easy. I really like the new look. More importantly, Quicken 2004 converted my 2001 information flawlessly, and I was up and running in just a few minutes. Sure, the opening screen is very different, but you have to expect that with an upgrade. It took a matter of minutes, not hours to become familiar with the new interface, and I really like many of the new one-click navigation features. I give it 4 stars; the fifth star would have to be earned by the VP in charge of Intuit's almost non-existent tech support staff. I said earlier I have been using Quicken for almost 20 years, but I gave up on its tech ""support"" more than 15 years ago. Too bad, the program itself deserves five stars."
34853,0,"I am generally pleased with the software and its use on my iMac G5. I was used to using AutoCad on a DOS machine and am getting aquainted with the differences. So far the confidence I had before is not not there with this software. After more use, I may be willing to raise my rating."
58185,1,"This one is alot better than the first. It full of suspense and mystery.See, this family friend and daytime soap opera star invites Nancy to NY to discover who could be threatening her Co-Star. You can go to three different areas and in each one you get to do alot of sleuthing and find alot of clues.You can question suspects like Rick and Mattie to find out what they have to hide.You can go through secret passage ways to find out information that can help you solve the case. I really enjoyed it but I only gave it four stars because I like the later games a little better. But I would highly reccomend this game to any ND fan."

7855,1,I have been happy with this product on my AMD 64 however the Celeron based machine on which I also installed this product sometimes hangs up and performs much slower which is to be expected. The price is certainly right! I have the full version of Outlook installed and find the Junk Mail filter to be sufficient without the need for additional Spam filtering software.
21441,2,"I bought this program based largely on the editorial review. My 2 year old knows his ABCs and I bought the program thinking it would focus on letter sounds. The four games that are included in the package are 1) an airplane skywriting letter match which quickly advances to identifying the first letter of a object and then selecting that letter from four choices. This sounded good, but in practice is not working out -- when the selection is incorrect the airplane very cutely writes a frowny face in the sky. It is difficult to get my airplane-loving son to understand that the frowny face is not a &quot;prize.&quot; 2) The second game is set in a zoo where George is to find an object that begins with a particular letter dictated by the Man in the Yellow Hat. Sounds like a good game, except that you have to use multiple screens in order to find the object. By the time one gets to multiple screens one has completely forgotten what letter was requested or what screens have already been viewed. The objects are animated and are cute, making the game fun, but again, the learning factor is lost in the details of the exercise. 3) The third game features a lake in which George is required to fish for ABC blocks. Sounds like it might be fun and educational -- except that the task of positioning the boat above the requested letter, then timing the click of the mouse just right in order to &quot;catch&quot; the block can be frustrating. The exercise of letter identification is not the point of the game -- it is a hand-eye coordination exercise and that is all. 4) The fourth game is a memory match game, which is the only one that my son truly understands and achieves the desired lesson. However, many of the preschool software packages contain memory match exercises which are more interesting and more educational.All in all, I am disappointed in this software. I have not yet found the right package for my child's skill and learning level. He has long tired of Reader Rabbit Toddler, is playing RR Preschool (but I have some complaints there as well), LOVES Dr. Seuss's ABC program which I also think is well written, LOVES Miss Spider's Tea Party which is especially good for developing listening to directions skills but is lacking on the ABC skills, and we are awaiting Richard Scarry software in hopes that it will fit the bill."
28324,1,I have been using the try before you buy copy. And so far it has done everything that I have asked of it. I look forward to using the full version. I really like the fact that I do not have to use a menu with it. Which makes it like using a VCR and having the tape autoplay when you put it in. Menus are good if you are wanting to add extra stuff. But make no sense to me if you are only putting a movie on the DVD. I also found it easier to edit the beginning and ending of a movie. I look forward to using more of the features.
34589,1,"The first Smokers collection quickly became a user-standard, filling every inch of its product with usable, well-crafted loops and loads of deconstructed hits. All of the hype for Smokers 1 was for good reason.No surprise that this sequel gets the same media treatment, much of it deserved. But a closer look at the collection exposes a slight flaw that keeps it from a 5-star rating: the beats are too much alike over too much of the disc. Sure, the drum SOUNDS are different, but the beats from folder to folder are mostly cut from the ""Keep On Movin'""/Lisa Stansfield cloth. I'd have liked more variety in the rhythms themselves, more backbeats, more play. Some people would call this kind of one-beat regimen ""working within the genre."" Sure...if the genre is two songs deep.That said, they compensate a great deal by offering ""dropped"" variations of the main beat (notice the singular) and more one shots than you can shake your hard drive at. if you like building your beats, this collection gives you some great fodder. It's a worthy addenudum to the original collection, if not quite the classic stand-alone that the previous incarnation was.A final note: it's horrendously overpriced considering these flaws."
74784,0,"Diskeeper may indeed be the best defrag utility ever, but it does have some highly frustrating attributes. Almost all of the automated features it has result in the computer being &quot;taken over&quot; by Diskeeper at the most inopportune times. Nothing like playing a game when suddenly Diskeeper decides its going to defrag the drive and zap almost 100% of the system resources for an undetermined period of time.It works OK when defragging manually, but stear clear of any of its automatic or scheduled features!"
4651,1,"Before using software for our firm, we were using AbacusLaw, the accountant recommended that we switch over to Quickbooks, and it has been the best and the smartest move that the firm did. It is user friendly, payroll and taxes are easy. Customer support is wonderful, helpful."
65896,1,"The shipper was prompt and the product is fine, except that it took a lot to get it loaded. This wasn't the shipper's fault. I give this encounter five stars, but as much as I like the Reader Rabbit series I don't think I'll buy more. There is little technical support."
40950,0,"I read the comment about the ""rainbow effect"", and decided to by the projector anyway, because it seemed like such a good deal, and I never noticed this artifact on any other projector. It definately has a beautiful picture, and makes watching movies a lot of fun, but about every twenty minutes when I blink or move my eyes there is a bright white imagine on the screen I notice a flashing stripe of red, blue and green on the borders of the white part of the image. It doesn't ruin the movie, but it is kind of distracting. Also, the fact that I can make this happen by moving my eyes quickly creates a distracting temptation. My girlfriend and roommate don't notice this at all (except when they intentionally move their eyes quickly around the screen). It's not a huge deal, but if I had to make the decision again, I would probably buy a different projector. I have never noticed this effect on other projectors, so I think there is something wrong with this one."
62610,0,"Overall I find that manual entry into the program is simple. Playback feature is nice, as I have used this for re-arranging pieces for my flute choir (to suit abilities) and I can listen for problem areas before having the choir play the pieces. I have been a bit disappointed with the scanning recognition - seems to be about 65% accurate with simple pieces but misses a lot if you get into dotted rhythms or 16th notes. Scanning does not work for grace notes, instrument cues, or ornaments. One other annoyance for me is that the licensing needs to be redone if you have to reload the program (disc failure, reformat, etc). Being out of the US, this was a bit tedious for me. MS Office used to have this kind of security, but manages to allow reloading of the software now. It would sure be nice if Finale was so simple..."
36461,1,This is a great old program that works great before they sold the Company.Works great on older Computers with the old operating systems.
73866,1,My then 4 year old son received Jump Start Advanced Kindergarten for Christmas. He loves it and continues to come back to play again and again. His favorite is the animal field trip. he is learning so much about different type of animals. He has played this set of games over 10 times in the last few months and I feel like there are many more aspects of the software he hasn't even seen.Definitly worth your money! I would buy it again in a second!!
5996,1,"I have not yet used the 2002 edition, but I have used previous editions for the last three years. It is pretty good software, and the first year it caught a deduction I missed that saved me a couple hundred bucks. My only complaint is that it is not straight forward to go back and make changes to sections that you have completed -- it can be quite confusing. I will pay for it again this year, but you would think that software used by this many people would have more than two competitors. I was hoping for a &lt;$10 program that would read info from my last year's Tax Cut data and provide a state return as well, but I couldn't find one this year."
23265,0,"The overall setup and layout is horrible. They laid out the main page to be so simple that you cannot change it, and it makes it very hard to utilize other functions such as the printing, notes, to-do items, loan manager, etc, etc. If it is not on the main page, then good luck in finding it. Overall this version stinks. There are a few upgrades that are nice, but none that really make that much of a difference."
13587,1,"I can't tell you how much I appreciate Office 2003. I spend most of my day in front of the computer and I really can feel the time savings now that I have upgraded. It was so easy and quick to upgrade, and all my settings were still there (I have a bunch in Outlook). I would definitely recommend Office 2003 and the templates that are included when you open a new file are fabulous... I use and benefit from Office 2003 every day!"
39217,1,"This is engrosing, stay-up-all-night fun, the way jigsaw puzzles SHOULD be, along with a tremendously interesting historical tour of the Cathedral, some marvelous characters and a few great puzzles thrown in for kicks."
57543,1,I just got this game over the weekend and I can't believe how much fun it is. I like it a lot more than Baseball 2003 because now it is all 3D. If those other people are having problems they should try buying a new computer.Season Play is great too because now I can unlock some more pros. I just got Piazza over yesterday. I also unlocked a robot called Clanky after playing one of the practice games. He is an awesome pitcher!Back to playing.
73705,0,"This piece of software has some very interesting features such as the video desktop mode where you can watch your dvd as it plays in the background on your desktop thus allowing to keep on working while watching. Another great feature is the capture mode that allows you to &quot;photograph&quot; a video frame while listening to the movieBut one problem does come to mind, dispite having more than the minimum requirements for the player sound playback is uneven. The player frequently seems to be a fraction of a second behind or in advance when compared with the movie."
13766,1,"I just wanted to put here a warning that the new version of Endnote (8.0) is out (7/04) and it is very buggy, - so if you are going to buy it, get version 7.0 if at all possible!"
71908,1,"I ordered this through Amazon marketplace, and this is one of the best purchases I've made. This game is brilliant! It's so simple and fun. My son is 2 and I do have to sit with him so far to help him do what he wants to do. The music game has such wonderful sounding music with the different instruments sounding quite real, with harmony, and so many different songs. It would be worth it just for the music part, but there are about 7 other games you can play as well. The other reviewer is right, this will not run on OSX. You have to have the ability to switch to Classic OS 9. Luckily all of our computers will do that. I'm recommending this game to all of my friends with toddlers."
10617,1,"Office 2004 for Mac is basically the same as the PC verison, except its design is more refined and user friendly.The toolbars are essentially little pop up windows that allow you to perform tasks via expandable tabs. This makes adding objects, formatting text, inserting tables, whatever your task at hand, very simple in an always open menu with all the fixins.This is usually point in the review where I would advise to wait for the new 2008 release of Office for MAC, but thanks to Apple's adoration of its customers, you can buy this version and upgrade to the new version when it comes out in March of 2008 for a small shipping and handling charge!You can't go wrong!"
89869,0,"Installation took forever, because there was nothing neat about it - download this, download that, sync the other... Endless. Not for the faint of heart. And the ongoing synching of documents does not integrate with the BlackBerry Desktop sync program, as it used to do for the Palm OS. As for usability, the product itself can only do so much on a puny BlackBerry, so I can sort of look at some Word documents, spreadsheets, PowerPoints, and PDFs, but it's pretty cumbersome to view and edit. I didn't give it a lower rating because the fault here lies just as much with the limited capacity of BlackBerries."
57164,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."
35616,1,"I am happy to see ACT! 6.0! I am also grateful to see that the folks at ACT! listened to me and improved their e-mail client in this new release. Their new e-mail client seems to work as well as Outlook, but now I don't ever have to leave the program, which is a huge plus. I also really like the library tab and I have been able to use the ACT! Quick Books link to tie my ACT! in with my Quick Book Pro.I am a huge fan! Keep up the good work ACT!"
69771,0,"We own the other two Caillou software titles and have enjoyed them both, but we are disappointed with Four Seasons of Fun, to a great extent because the potential is here for a really fun game; that potential is not realized, however, due to rigid and sometimes confusing navigation, bugs and less interesting activities.Whereas the two earlier Caillou games involved wandering around Caillou's house, this title starts inside but spends the rest of the game outside moving around the neighborhood. The look of the area and the activities change according to the season initially selected by the player. So far, so good. However, our iMac freezes about 25% of the time during the dressing segment and, like other reviewers, we find this section confusing -- it's not often apparent, for instance, what specific shirt or coat a child should choose.Unlike the earlier titles, there is less freedom of navigation. Players proceed in a rigid, linear progression between activities, and game play is not always smooth. Some of the activities are: (1) Race-along, an obstacle course that Caillou must navigate on his skateboard. Your child has to decide whether Caillou should jump over, duck under, or go around various objects. This segment is compelling for preschoolers, but Caillou moves VERY slowly, and if the player doesn't press the appropriate key at precisely the right time, Caillou will have risen from his crouch or come down from his jump too early. At the same time, feedback is not really salient; our little one doesn't recognize that Caillou's &quot;spinning&quot; is a bad thing, and since the player must continue until 7 objects are successfully navigated, this can go on and on. (2) Caillou rakes his way through a letter maze. Tedious. (3) Bouncing ball rhyming. Unimaginative. (4) Snowman Builder, in which the player copies another snowman. First of all, why stifle creativity? Also, when we are in the &quot;Fall&quot; and click on the rake, the narrator still says &quot;Snowman Builder&quot; even though that's not the activity that will follow. Was this beta tested?All-in-all, we were predisposed to enjoy this game but were ultimately disappointed with it. We will certainly not rush to buy another Caillou title. Better bets for your preschooler are Reader Rabbit, Little Bear, Franklin or Winnie the Pooh offerings. Interestingly, we have found the same inconsistent quality with Zoboomafoo software, another PBS franchise. What gives?Pros: familiar, beloved characters; interesting premise in a promising setting; seamless cutscenes; multiple levels of difficulty; simple navigationCons: rigid, sometimes confusing, navigation; no written instructions; no keyboard volume control; fewer, and less interesting, activities; less stability"

61357,2,"for the most simplistic designs it's OK, but I tried to design a kitchen island with a sink in it and it quickly ran into limitations. The program would refuse to place a kitchen sink in an island. I ran into more frustrations, like positioning cabinets and limited choice of them as well. I stopped using the software within two weeks because of excessive amount of time it required to accomplish simple things. As a software developer myself, I'm used to cracking new software pretty easily, but with this opus by Punch!, I had to search for videos online, try to use the built-in help that sucks ( no real help beyond trivial cases ), overall, feels like a licensed 3D game engine with a number of half-baked additions and a lot of marketing hype. After two years of not using the software, I picked it up from the shelf since I wanted to create a house blueprints for construction permit, just to find out that for the full-size blueprints, you have to order those online and they will be ""shipped directly to you"". Continues the ""bait and switch"" tactics, you never know what you get until you paid and then it's too late to complain. I blame myself and write review to warn the others."

30619,0,It was ok.Had a hard time geting it to run.Softwair good. Seller not.
297,2,I bought this program to load onto my laptap for school and work. You can only download the installation cd. You cannot load the other 7 cd's onto your hard drive. For anyone who does not want to have to tote around a bunch of cd's this is not the program for you. I have emailed the company to see if an upgrade will be released but I have not received a reply yet. I am now looking for a program that can be completely loaded onto my hard drive. This was a waste of money.

3372,1,"This game is soooooooo 3D!You won't find silly cartoons stick poeple etc in this game!I love making my own contraptions and letting my mom play!If you want your kid to now a lot about physics then this is a great game!It has a lot of new stuff like a monkey and a jack in the box.It keeps all the old contraptions the same so don't worry about losing contraptions in the old game that you liked.The gears are made easyer so you don't need to take them out then put them back to get them working unlike in the first game.It is very compatiple with most computers I heard it works on Mac and I had a Windows me wich it worked on and now I have a XP and it works even better on that.This game is not like most games that you complete in weeks, months, days, or even one day this game takes years!But it's not too hard so you won't need to wory about not beeing able to complete one contraption.The tutorial level is to get started and to learn the basics.The easy level is to get you to understand the controls and to get your brain runing and any other stuff it also gets you better at reading the real hints and knowing those things that might trick you like extra parts.This game is a great buy!But there is some things like harming animals but what I do is say thay are just robots."
92081,0,"As the product description isn't thorough, let me add on here:The Legacy of Rosemond Hill-Select from 25 different horses to groom & train,-Compete in 5 categories of competition, each including show jumping, steeplechase, and the cross-country course.-Ride successfully and gain access to more difficult competition levels.Competitions at Rosemond Hill-Create your own character and riding tracks and share them with others.-Challenge yourself and your horse in all new riding competitions.-Select from new horses.The Legacy of Rosemond was my favorite. It followed a storyline with a bit of a mystery feel; fast-moving with being frustrating or repetitive. You complete chores around a barn, a few examples are mucking out the stalls, feeding and watering the horses, and grooming the horses. As you compete in competitions you unlock more horses, thus adding to the responsibility. I thought it was fun talking to the people and practicing for the competitions.As for Competitions at Rosemond Hill, I didn't play it much. Others may think differently, but I found it confusing and not very much fun. If you enjoy the competition part of these games, then you'd probably like it a lot.Overall, it is a good game. I wasn't impressed with the choppy graphics and it lookes as if they had been done on a very cheap budget. I played the game a lot for the first couple months, but, to be honest, after the other Let's Ride games came out, it got sort of shoved way back in the shelf. If you're going to spend money on a horse game, buy Let's Ride Dreamer or Saddle Up with Pippa Funnel.Thanks for the taking the time to read this and I hope it helps you."

70899,1,"If your child is good at science this game will certainly challenge him/her. It will also challenge parents if they are equally involved in stuff like this. As a whole it could be parent(s) spending time together with their kids & challenging themselves at the same time. It also provides solution to compare it to what solution you might find. Have given it to one of niece, she found quite challenging, considering she is smart gal. Can also create your experiment as mentioned in the description etc. Fyi, did not have any installation issues. Graphics are good. I would recommend buying it if your child is really interested in this kind of game."
73157,1,"I have been using Windows for 6 years now, and every couple of months I normally had to do the old &quot;re-format and re-install&quot; just to keep windows healthy and reduce the number of reboots to an acceptable level.I always thought that it was common for an operating system to crash after a couple of hours surfing until I installed Redhat Linux 7.1 It has NEVER crashed for me! Its unbelievable!The installation is even more advanced than Windows 2000 installation which is still largely text based. I installed and configured a dual boot system in less than 15 minutes, via the GUI installation wizard.The range of Free GPL software for Linux is also very impressive. The only thing now is, that, unlike Microsoft, I have too much choice!!Amazing!"

Without Connectix I'd be a PC-er not a Mac person. That said...Compared to version 4, this program is very slow. Also, it thinks the only available network is through my modem.

One problem I had that took a while to figure out, since Roxio and the electronics store that I purchased it at kept passing the buck, was that the manual tells you to lay your soundtrack by pointing to a frame of the movie. Unh Unh.....doesn't work.....you have to lay it by pointing to the timeline track. So much trouble for such a simple solution but other than that I give it a big thumbs up!"
72051,1,"If you connect to the internet then you need ZoneAlarm. I think its the best there is when it comes to keeping the outside out. All messages coming in or going out are screened. One thing I really like over other firewalls is Zone Alarms default settings basically until you say something is safe zone alarm will not let it through, although this means as the company describes it &quot;Zone Alarm is chatty at first but soon quietens down&quot;. For example you have to ok internet explorer and your mail client before you can use them but this only takes a few minutes. There are lots more options for techies to customize if need be.Believe me you need this."

32115,0,"My real complaint with this fresh, good encyclopedia [my version was that for 2004] is that after ""31 October"" the ""free content updates"" stop. I had assumed that after that point I could subscribe to monthly updates at what I thought would be a modest annual fee. But the fact is that when the updates stop, often a few months after you buy the Encarta, you must purchase a whole new Encarta at full price and ""toss"" or rather delete the old Encarta. And the new Encarta runs out in another year. Then another full purchase, and then another. At a going and and rising price of say $70 for the DVD, that is a high cost over time for an encyclopdiea that has little of the real depth of a hard-copy Britannica or other established book-format encyclopedias. The whole benefit of the internet is that things can be updated (and, yes, for a reasonable annual fee), but Encarta provides us with throwaway ""computer books"" purely to get top dollar out of us once a year, or so it seems. Even the old Encyclopedia Britannica books provided a rudimentary update, for a much smaller fee than full re-purchase, of annual yearbooks. I'll be checking around to see what the DVD Britannica's update policy is (perhaps similar, perhaps not). In any case, I'm unhappy with the planned obsolescence of the Encarta encyclopedias, unhappy that such obsolescene was not made explicit from the start on the box (others I know had assumed there would be some system for continuing updates beyond ""31 October""; when Encarta says updates will be ""free"" until that date, I think one is justified in assuming that they won't be free after, but that then you must begin to pay. The wording does not suggest that the updates will stop completely.) This situation will probably send me (and others) back to my old research tool---Google, which keeps on coming updated even as I type these lines. I had recommended this encyclopedia to many students and a few friends: I will no longer recommend it without full disclosure of the update policy. Until this month I had been one of Encarta's real fans and I bet I've ""sold"" a bunch of copies for them. Now I'll get in the habit of doing my research elsewhere. (Also, Encarta does not really encourage feedback on such matters. They give a mailing address for stamped letter, but do not provide any on-line or either tolled or toll-free telephone access to anyone who might want to bring up such a complaint. Surely they understand that this is no longer a letter-writing world, and that makes their customer service job easier for them, and less satisfactory for customers.)"
82109,1,I just got this game and I can't stop playing. The scanner looks like a cell phone (kinda cool). I take it with me everywhere and scan stuff.

I hope all my friends get the game because you can trade powers from one scanner to another.
20189,1,"I have been using Picture It! Publisher Platinum Edition V.2001 since 2001 shortly after I went online. Though it does use up some memory, I have found it to be the BEST photo editing software out there. I've used many others, or tried them out, and I always go back to PIP. Not only does it have so many more features, but I've also designed and published web sites using PIP. I've added music and sounds to my web sites with PIP. I've also designed E-cards with sounds and matching graphics, sometimes using photos. You can also do crafts projects. When the Grandchildren were small I made them cards with the small envelopes for which to add money. My Grandchildren used to send me their pictures for editing so they could use them to make Christmas ornaments.With my PIP I can change the page(photo)size, use a number of neat photo ""frames,"" but I also make all my greeting cards with PIP...even though I have other software. Downsizing the photo size enables one to use the photos on a web site without taking up much space yet you still have the same size photo when you view it from the ""thumbnail."" I can add text using various fonts to my pictures, as well.I also use it for photos for selling on Ebay. Not only do I make photo albums using a number of styles, but I can delete and add my own clip art, photos, etc. I can also change any greeting card and/or verse any way I wish, for example, I can add other clip art to my card.I have a motto when it comes to my Picture It! Publisher software: ""Once you have this, you won't want any other."" I plan to purchase a new set so that I can send my online friend in Africa my set.If I ever have to sacrifice software for memory, it certainly won't be my PIP. I am a 66 year old lady. If I can do PIP, anyone can!I hope PIP will always be available!Kay from Pennsylvania"
38677,1,Put it short -- in under $80 package you get all the fuctionality that an average user would have to get InDesign and Photoshop for overwise.

You have to go to the website and there are a couple of video, but there is no trouble shooting. What finally helped me, when I got stuck, was the forum. There I found answers to my problems. I use it and plan to keep it. For me it was worth the small price, and it's a good learning tool."

91748,1,"I have been a purchaser of this PaperPort software application for most versions since it was owned by Visioneer and came free as bundled software with my first scanner. It has become Mission Critical software for me and my company. I have over the years criticized the company for its support. I would love for them to alter their Philosophy and Strategy, they have not, which is the reason why I suppose, for many being dissatisfied. This has not lessened my personal satisfaction with the Software or my opinion of the current version 11, which is the best yet. Use and improved functionality with each new version have helped to form my opinion.You will appreciate the move to a more easily guided user interface, which now assists the novice user more readily but can easily be toggled on & off, as you gain experience.The New Scanner Wizard is thaBomb! If you need to increase your scanning production for documents within your organization, then this functionality alone can justify the expense. It is unrivaled except in much higher priced software packages.The feature improvements in the toolbars and the right click menus and the ability to operate within split explorer windows along with the move to make the package more Microsoft friendly, all serve to make Version 11 more compatible to the way you work.Installation can be tricky, because the software serves to interface your document control with integration to so many other software applications you may use. It integrates with your office applications, it has OCR capabilities, from it you can fax, email, fill out forms, etc. This software can be the package that allows you to dispose of your metal file cabinet for your new electronic one.Aside from the negative or the positive Hype that is there to read, there are user forums that exist to help, this may cost you in time, but it is time which makes up for the savings.My advice; Take the plunge.Satisfied user,Bill Wray"

I've used AutoSketch to build a wheel chair ramp and it worked perfectly. This program is everything I will need to get dimensioned drawings for projects that require this type of work. I'm using it now to see how existing furniture will fit into a new house we're in the process of buying. So far no complaints - you will have to be familiar with principals of mechanical drafting to get the most from this, but out of the box I was productive and very proficient in a couple of days."

If everyone else starts using it, that could take away some of my edge in the game. *wink*The bots all have their own playing styles. Some are aggressive, some passive, some sneakier and others more straightforward. Many adjust to your playing style, while others don't seem to be quite so perceptive. All in all, it's quite a bit like a real game, but without putting your money on the line. However, it plays as though there is real money involved, which makes it better than playing against other players online for free.I have not experimented with different advisors, but have found that it's better for me to ignore what the default ones tell me to do."

56288,0,"I bought PSP versions 4 through 10 and believe version 6 to have been the best. You could draw a straight or curved line and do it intuitively and straightaway without reading books on the program or going to schools or reading wordy boring HELP files.Version 10, on the other hand, seems designed to mess with one's head because you have to read HowTo books and endless HELP pages or go online for additional help just to draw various lines--straight or curved! Other people take a year of lessons at university just to understand the basics of such a complex program as verion 10. Sadly, this good company laid an egg with their ""10"" as it is hopelessly complex and non-intuitive. Worse, trying to master it will affect your job security--maybe even knock you on your keester when you look down at the bottom of the left hand icon bar and see this dumb WP quill pen button that lets you work your brain and butt off trying to draw anything but a straight line!Maybe PSP's versions 11 or 12 will sort out the collapse in the non-prioritized ""everything-is-criticality-one-with-us"" design philosophy they've built into version 10. Or maybe they won't. If one can't do the common everyday drawing/desinging things instantly and easily, then one won't very long stand in line to go back to some engineering school to learn the ""basics"" of PSP version ""whatever.""One last thing: if you've lost their software [downloaded stuff from them is risky as you can't always retrieve a backup from them if your HD crashes and the program is lost] you better know a very good phone number up at Corel because you won't get any help in their non-existent CustomerServiceDepartment. In fact, it's virtually impossible to get an intelligent cut-to-the-chase person on the other end of the line.Other than my two complaints above, I would rank the company and their later PSP releases after number 6--version 6 was excellent!--as a 3.0 on a scale of 1 to 5.(Do note: I spend 10 to 12 hours daily drawing and designing things and writing stuff. I believe I can beat anyone's socks off [artistic quality and speed of production the only criteria] using an old DRAW program for DOS as far as drawing a human face or body is concerned! The program I speak of was big in 1986 when I started using it)."
42047,1,"I was lucky enough to get Office 2003 before the official release date. Microsoft has done a nice job on the interface. Everything looks cleaner, and it will pop up useful sidebars on the righthand side (such as the clipbook for pasting items you have copied, help items, etc).Another thing about the interface is that it meshes nicely with Windows XP themes. It will take a soft blue color when paired with Windows XP's default theme. All of the bars will be blue. This is nice on the eyes. The same goes with silver - everthing will match.As for upgrading to 2003 from older versions... this is a tough call. If you have Word XP, I would be hard pressed to tell you to upgrade. Even Word 2000 does a fine job. I don't know if there are enough new bells and whistles in this to warrant upgrading. If you like to have the newest of everything however, this is the best word processor out there for PCs.For those of you on a tight budget, thers is hope. As good as Microsoft Office products are, there is a FREE alternative. You may want to give OpenOffice 1.1 a download.

More importantly, though, my software suddenly &quot;lost&quot; one much-used quad sheet, leaving white space in it's place on my screen. I also lost all the markers and trails associated with that area, which included several day's work. Called their customer service for assistance and was connected to a very rude, arrogant, and unhelpful technician. Result: no fix. The company needs to back an excellent product with helpful and knowledgable technicians."

Several of the other sets were in .cbr or .cbv format which is a zipped or rar archive file set up to be read by a free program called Comic Book Reader which was included with the dvd. The controls are MUCH better than Adobe Acrobat and are CUSTOMIZABLE! So you can set it up to view the way you like and it stays that way.I am waiting for them to go back to this format, as pdf's are not meant to be read easily. You can't mouse click to flip between the pages.I fail to understand why they decided to go with pdf files, since extracting the pix from a pdf is pretty easy. All they did was make it harder to view the files.BOO! As cheap as this is, hold out for a return to the easier and better format.PS: you can also unzip .cbz or .cbr files and edit the pix. I like cleaning them up and fixing coloring defects as well as rotating any pages that were printed sideways."

15553,1,"In my case Save and Restore was purchased for the purpose of backing up all the hard drives on three computers. The copy I purchased was 3 user version bundled with Norton 360 a couple of years ago. Norton 360 does incremental backups on my data files (My documents, Email, Explorer Favorites, recent downloaded files, music and picture files). My tax data gets burned to three different CDs right after my taxes are done and gets removed from the hard drive.Complete drive backups by S&R; are done every 4 months. On the three computers a combined total of 18 backups have been done without any problems. I might not have encountered some of the problems mentioned by others here since my needs are fairly simple. Using Windows XP Home or Professional comments about using this program with Vista cannot be made.The hard drive on my notebook computer was recently replaced and Save and Restore preformed flawlessly. Everything was restored to the new and larger hard drive without having to match the partition size of the replaced drive. Since this was a planned replacement I immediately did the save and restore and skipped using the incremental backup from 360. It was poorly planned actually, as I should have tested the 360 backup files while still having a fully functional original drive.In case you are interested the madness in generic terms behind my backup program is presented below.The first and most important comment is the computers I have are not used for business, except for a limited number of emails.Having both a large collection music and picture files that are constantly being added to the following backup procedure was devised. Pictures and music added to the computer go into the music and picture folders. These are the ones backed up by Norton 360. For one computer the free online storage is 2 GB, for two or three computers it is a total of 4 GB.Every four months a total drive backup with S&R; is done. Before doing so the picture and music files are copied to the Bmusic and Bpicture folders. After a successful backup all the files in the music and pictures folders are deleted. Any software installed from either CD or download is also stored separately and moved once a total backup is done. This may sound complicated, but it is quite easy to do and has worked well for me.The backup drive for a total drive backup should be at least 1.5 times the size of the drives being backed up. This will allow enough room for two backup copies of the drives using the default S&R; settings. As backups sometime fail, it is a good idea to always have a minimum of two copies. What I did was make two total backups upon getting the S&R; program followed by deleting and replacing the oldest backup every four months.The time it takes to backup a disk drive is not strictly based upon the total size of the backup, but the number of files as well. The speed of the drives being backed up from the speed of the drives having the backup written to along with the speed of the CPU, also figure into this equation. A SATA II external hard drive will have a speed about 7.5 times that of a USB drive but may not give backup speeds 7.5 times faster than a USB drive on some systems due to the weakest link item.Be sure to make a backup copy of the Save and Recover program disk. Without this disc any backups made would be useless. It would also be a good idea to boot your computer from this disc at least once to verify your backup is going to be useable when needed.All the Best"

29222,0,"Among the all-in-one MP3 ripper/encoder/jukebox products out there, MusicMatch is definitely the best, imho. BUT, the extra features you get from the non-free, registered version is only a slight improvement. I really do like the program and did buy a lifetime upgrade for the deluxe version. And if you do buy it, download it from their website and buy the upgrade key...it's a few bucks cheaper.The only thing is, I don't use this application any more. There are lots of opinions on the best way to encode an MP3 and the one I agree with most, is the combination of the Exact Audio Copy ripper and the LAME encoder. General opinion on the Internet says that EAC is the best(most accurate CD ripper) available. PLUS, the LAME encoder, which is open source software, is considered to be the superior encoding engine. The only other codec worth a crap, is from the original creator of the MP3 compression scheme, Fraunhofer. That encoder is what is used in MusicMatch and Nero. The problem with those implementations is that it cuts off at 16kHz. Not the greatest for archiving, but if you don't care about getting the best sound quality, it's okay. For most people, it's hard to hear the difference between an MP3 encoded with MusicMatch and LAME (or any other encoder for that matter). What MusicMatch is definitely good at is doing it all, fairly easily. Encoding a CBR rip of my CD's is definitely faster with MM6.1 than the EAC/LAME combo.In the end, I still care about getting the BEST sound quality out of my MP3's and so I will stick with EAC and LAME(besides, they're free). I even paid for MM, but still choose not to use it."

51432,1,"The main reason I purchased this software over another brand is that it works with Windows XP SP1 and the similar quality packages from other companies do not. I have not used the other packages, since they won't work on my machine. One of the features I like about this software is that videos can be positioned in 3-D space. Actually, it is 4-D space when you considered that it is also on a timeline. I did find that one must be careful with some of the features it has. Rendering one two and a half minute video with some videos rotating in 3-D space required sixteen hours. Experience should improve the ability to optimize the rendering cycle.The DVD Production software has many more features than the majority of the point and click DVD burning packages that are widely available. If you have seen a feature on a DVD and wondered how to get it, it appears this package can make it possible."
493,0,"When it comes to compositing,Shake can do just about anything you would ever want to do. I own a small private media company (meaning a one man show- me) and I bought Shake, along with some plug-ins to try to fix a problem I was having with some footage. First, let me say the final result was amazing, the 3 frames I rendered looked great. The problem was those three frames took about an hour, and since I had about 4 hours of footage, this ended up being a bust for me.I've also used Shake for some more generic compositing. I love the set up and interface, and basic design - but beware, if you try to do very much expect huge render times (unless you're one of those people who happen to have their own render farm in their basement). I run off of what was a top-of-the-line powermac 3 years ago (dual processor, 8 gigs Ram, good Nvidia 6800 graphics as well as an additional Cinewave graphics card, and doing anything major, even to a short clip usually means I have to walk away from my computer for a couple of days, at least - one 30 minute clip with moderate compositing and effects took nearly a week, until I finally gave up and killed it and went back into AfterEffects instead.So, in short, if you're a ""pro-sumer"" like me, even the low price now would probably be better spent somewhere else(I won't lie, some of my dissapointment may also be the fact that I bought this literally one week before the price dropped by 75%)"

It simply will not efficiently allow you to create a project, load and edit it, then burn it out to DVD. Along this fairly straight forward route you will encounter repeated error messages including Windows telling you that it needs to shut down ShowBiz because it has created errors.

14941,1,"I've been using this program for 6 years. I got the upgrade and hate it and went back to the old version. I have been able to do very professional effects with my photos. I started out taking photos of my children and now I'm building up a photography business doing mainly family photos and children. I usually use spotlights, warm, dark, sharpening, artistic, tints, and edging with color fill to enhance my photos along with cropping. It did take me a while to figure it out and I still probably don't use all of the features it offers, but I use what works best for me. I was thinking of upgrading to Adobe Lightroom, but I'm unsure if it's worth the money when I've been having good results with this. It's compatible with Window 7 even though it says that is isn't, but I have concerns about if it will consistently be compatible with computer upgrades. I couldn't do anything with the 4.0 upgrade, so I wouldn't recemmend that. It was a big waste of money. However, I can do a lot with the 2.0 and have had multiple compliments and other photographers have asked me what effects program I use."
38440,1,"I just bought XP Pro because MS is supposed to phase out XP in June of this year. Go to InfoWorld and read about why the world is up in arms with MS. Over 200,000 signatures have signed the petition to save XP.And MS is loving every minute of it, as well as all PC and hardware manufacturers. Why?Vista has promoted the sale of new PCs, Printers, Scanners, etc. This is a win-win scenario for MS, PC and hardware manufacturers. And Vista will not run off most of your 3rd party applications, but it runs MS's Office, games, and other MS applications. Does this sound familiar (IE vs Netscape wars)?Because Vista does not work, everyone must buy a copy of XP to replace Vista. All of the different packaged versions of the same Windows OS were created to take advantage of everyone. A few years back I bought XP 64. It was not supported by Adelphia (now Comcast) and I could not even get on the Web.I believe MS designed Vista so it would not work on most machines and to promote PC and peripheral sales; money flowed to MS by selling flawed Vista and by double-dipping XP Pro/Home to replace dysfunctional Vista just to make our expensive PCs useful again. In 2010 MS will grease world-wide ATM debits by selling Windows 7/its next version. MS learned well from all of its other OS failures (95, 98, especially from Millennium).MS and PC hardware manufacturers are in the hog pen together, selling Windows, Printers, software applications, and on and on. Aren't most of the hardware manufacturers behind the power curve, not producing drivers or driver updates for Vista?I think Congress needs to do some investigating, that is, if they are not already in MS's deep soft money pockets!The Al Queda mind set (AQMS) is in warp drive in the U.S., the AQMS financial version that is (also oil, mortgage ARMs, medical, drugs, and so on).""Let the Buyer Beware"" does not apply to MS software because many buyers are trumped by clever advertising/hype/mis-information.

56508,1,"I have read all the negative reviews and I feel compelled to add my sucess story. I first bought this program for my oldest daughter (class of 2000). We decided to give this a try before spending money on a &quot;live class&quot; program. She had taken the SATs once and did not score as well as she wanted. She was an IB student with little time to &quot;learn&quot; how to score well on a test. She tried this software, not adhering faithfully to all the instructions, but completing most of it. She took the SAT at the end of her junior year. Her scores increased by a whooping 200 points! I recommended it to my sister and her son increased his scores by 150 points. It may be just a matter of a few pointers on how to answer a standardized test, or the fact that you are now focused on one type of question and they teach you how to answer it, but I would highly recommend it. It is not a live class, it will require self-motivation, and if you are not prepared academically, it will not replace what you should have learned in four years of high school, but it will teach you a few tricks on how to score better on standardized testing.

Could it have been done better? Sure. But it's live footage with no professional acting, and I got everything I wanted in terms of the feeling of the station set up and the launches. It was great to see the school with the kids asking questions. Our news media so completely ignores good news that I really didn't know about the education outreach programs. I have never been to see a launch up close and here I got to see not only a basic 3D view from Florida, but also a nice glimpse of detail from the Russian facility. A lot of these early 3D blu-rays are more about the novelty of 3D than about ultimate production values. If you are interested in our space program you will enjoy this. I also thought something was wrong when the opening sequences came up 2D but it's easy to figure it out and wait for the 3D to start."

13082,1,"This was my first year doing taxes for myself. I've always been skeptical about using software to get them done, so I usually pay too much to a CPA to do them for me. After a lot of encouragement from friends I decided to give this a try. Other than some ESPP sales, my return was pretty simple. I bought the Premier version.What I liked:- Nice interview process. Of course, it helped that I had prior year returns that had been prepared by a professional, so I kind of knew what the questions meant.- Easy import of W2 and 1099 information.- A check to make sure the return contained no errors.- Online support from Intuit was very prompt.Some things I would have liked to see:- There's a screen where it tells you how much you can contribute to a Roth IRA, but it doesn't put the information on the instruction sheet when you print the return for filing. That would be useful.Bugs that I encountered:Basically lots of printing-related bugs.- When I tried to print from the file->print menu, and asked it to print a return for filing, it only printed the federal return. I had to go to the ""print"" tab and print return for filing to PDF, and then it printed both federal and state.- I had the same problem when using the file->print menu to print a copy of the returns and worksheets for personal records. So I just printed the federal portion using this.- The method for printing the copy for records (including worksheets) to pdf was not as straightforward as when printing the return for filing. I couldn't figure it out so I used Intuit's online support. However, even thought I followed the instructions from them, I found that it did not print all of the worksheets. I contacted them about this and was told to just print to paper. So I have to live without a pdf copy of my return containing all the worksheets."
91497,1,"I test drove this and Movie Magic 2000 before making my purchase.Movie Magic is just NOT ready for prime time. It is BUGGY. The cursor will pop into different places on the screen after operations. The voice read uses windows system and is MUCH harder to control than Final Draft.Also, some of Move Magic's default formatting is outdated (like CONT after action between the same character which is no longer used).This is clearly better and more professional. Movie Magic may have more &quot;options&quot; but when you want a correctly formatted screenplay, what kind of options do your really need anyway?If you want to save the test drive time which I did for several days, go ahead and just get Final Draft. If you run the two side by side, you will see what I mean... Movie Magic is so unprfessional looking and feeling.I do hope they put an index and a way to edit in index mode in future versions however.Mike"
50949,1,"honestly, i had no problems making dvd backups of my dvds. i travel regularly and would rather take a copy with me than the real dvd. imagine losing a movie overseas and having to pay $20-$30 for another copy of my movie. one note, make sure you download the plug-in otherwise it will not work. if you're using it to make movie copies for your ipod, beware, the copy i made had a problem syncing video with audio. the audio was a couple of seconds slower than the video so it looked like a badly dubbed video. also does NOT work transferring subtitled movies to your ipod."

78324,1,"This is a little-kid adventure game which is similar in nature to big-people adventure games like Myst, but obviously much more simplified.My 3 year old daughter loves this game. She needed some help when she first started playing, but now she can go to the computer, start the program, and play all by herself. She has solved the adventure many times and she still has fun with it. We have gotten many hours of enjoyment out of this game."
13208,0,"Crashes too much.Look at the dates on the other reviews (all of them - about 10 at this time). Notice all the nice ""5 star"" reviews come in clumps on the same date (3 on one date, 2 on another, 3 on another)! Also note that nearly all the ""5 star"" reviews are from people who did not have any other review on Amazon. And they are all about the same length.I trust the lower star ratings reviews on this product more than the 5 star ones. Especially the person who wrote the longish review."
22884,1,"Like any software, this program is not perfect - but it is an excellent value. The help function is weak: for example, it was difficult to find where to enter personal ratings of a recipe. However, the program is sufficiently user-friendly that one rarely wishes for a help function.Cooking Light recipes are an excellent base for cooking. Entering recipes by hand is easy. Importing recipes in MasterCook format from the Serra site is simple. Importing recipes in text format is a bit more difficult but the tool for editing is good.It provides a number of useful features - meals, meal plans for a period of time, shopping lists, pantry items expiration dates, a wine selector, comprehensive nutritional analysis including exchanges for diabetics - as well as photos, cooking tips etc. I did not load the pictures onto my PC; the program handles the absence with style ... a generic, graytoned picture.The basic print format is satisfactory with two-sides options; I have not yet experimented with one's ability to manipulate the output.What features do I wish it had? An ability to export the added ingredients list, a cheese list equivalent to the wine list, and a better handling of alternate ingredients, nutritional analysis for individual family members, purchasable add-ins for other cookbooks, ratings of ingredients by brand name or variety (not all tea is equal, for example)What features do I especially like? The freedom to use my own categories and rating system, the ability to search for recipes using ingredients I have on hand (useful only AFTER one loads the data which is simple but time consuming), the thoroughness of the nutritional analysis, the arrangement of recipes and menus for easy access, the intuitive interface so one can learn the system by doing ...This is a software package that makes on-line cookbooks use the computer capabilities for a tangible advantage rather than simply computerizing the paper cookbooks 'cause the computer's there."

You can also download xtra clothes, toys, etc. The dogz can have puppiez, which look like both of the parents. Family trees are recorded for 8 generations. Really cute!"
39666,1,"This game rules. It is way longer than The Haunted Carousel but it's definitely worth it. The puzzles like the Mayan number display and the temple quizzes were challenging but very fun and I learned a lot! I never really thought I would like the game considering it was a gift and I wasn't really interested in the Mayan culture, but once I played I just became attached! I really suggest this game if you like scary stuff (don't ask). You'l know what I'm talking about soon enough!"
9794,1,"Mortal Kombat is a movie based on the game series. Mortal Kombat is about people who have to fight to defend earth. Mortal Kombat was a pretty good movie overall. Though I believe the movie should have been a lot better. Mortal Kombat is suppose to be about blood and gore, but in the movie there was not much of that which is kind of disappointing. Still Mortal Kombat was almost at the level of A grade movies, so you should check it out."
90755,1,"As we grow into OneNote, I am amazed at all that we are discovering. The whole family is using it. I strongly recommend working through the OneNote Guide that they include with it. It is really very basic and it does a great job introducing the features.Then you can sign up at Microsoft for some free e-learning to further learn about the full potential of this software.Right now, Microsoft allows for a free download of a trial version to see if it is for you.We were allowed up to three installs on our family computers.Enjoy!"

67065,1,"I don't usually deem any software tool ""essential"", but if you work in certain fields - like teaching, marketing, tech support, & project management for starters - this one definitely qualifies.Most computer-savvy people can do a simple screen capture, but SnagIt expands that to allow you to record a video of anything on the screen. This allows you to, for example, not only show what's in a spreadsheet cell but how to enter contents, change the formatting, or see the real-time updates on screen. You can then edit your captures (whether still shots or video) to convey exactly the message you want.SnagIt is very easy to use, but it has another feature that you'll quickly appreciate. That feature is the ability to customize capture profiles that you use frequently. This is not only a great time-saver, but it also helps create a consistent look and feel to your presentations - a good thing when you want your boss or your customers to instantly recognize your work.In short, SnagIt will add significant value to what you do. At less than $40 it's one of the best software bargains around."
66158,1,"Fun, because you can view the galaxy & beyond from literally any position in space, and in any time (what did the sky look like when you were born? When Ptolemy was alive?), and educational, because these guys aren't dummies throwing together some flashy thing with no science behind it. The product feels like it was made by people who really care about what they're doing. Lots of depth in the information they provide, & connections to professional weather & astronomy sites (e.g. a weather map). I use this at home but I bet teachers would love this.I'd definitely recommend the Pro product over the others because you can hook up your digital telescope -- a cool & incredibly helpful feature.Did I mention thoughtful things like ""night vision"" viewing? And beautiful graphics!"
4941,2,"I had been using Symantec Anti-virus for years and when it came time to renew they offered the opportunity to &quot;upgrade&quot; to Internet Security I bought based on how pleased with the base anti-virus program. What a disappointment! It crashed my Windows 2000 system like it was a demolition derby! The recommended fix, changing the IRPStackSize, did nothing to stop the crashes. I ended up disabling it and I won't renew again."
82444,0,"I had purchased this item and found out later that one of the three cd-roms was bad. The company ran me around in circle for weeks try this and try that. I found the one file on the cd-rom was bad. They now wanted more than what I had paid for it to exchange the cd-rom. Long story short, I finnally got a new cd-rom for the free. Just check out their product carefully and save your receipts and packaging so that it can be returned if you have a problem.My kids love the games, but were a little upset by having to wait almost three months for Pajama Sam."

24290,1,"I purchased this after looking endlessly for a decent computer game that would require my children to think while they played. I am so pleased with this program. I can't say enough about the growing logic skills that my five and three year old are developing from playing this game. They call this a ""thinking game."" As other reviewers indicated this is a grow-with-me program. This is a keeper for our boys."
33489,1,"There are a lot of CD-ROMs out there, but this one is engaging and fun for our 3.5 year old son. The fundamentals for reading and even math are well established: rhyming words, matching letters, sequencing of events, identifying words that begin or end with the same sound, observing and categorizing objects. Another child in his pre-school is already reading due in part to this software and Clifford Reading CD-ROM by Scholastic. Richard Scary stories are one of our child's favorites and the stories here do not disappoint. The only thing that prevents me from awarding fives stars is that during the reading of a story, each individual word should be highlighted. One tip: I found this at Zany Brainy for half the price here."
70929,1,This is a great game to exercise the mental muscles. Sometimes we work on the same problem for a few days. I wish it had the option to save games for more than one player. My kids and I work on this together which makes it more fun.
68368,0,"I find Photoshop to be non-intuitive and a resource-hog. However, Photoshop is the standard in photo-editting and if I want to get advice from another photographer, he/she will give it in Photoshop terms so I'm forced to buy this product."
60558,1,"I eagerly awaited for this release knowing that Hemera Tech's Photo-Objects were of very high quality. And since this product contains not just photo-objects but also high quality photos, raster images, web graphics, and photofont maker, i decided it is a must.But it is not all that good. it has its hits and misses. The photos are good and of high quality but the web graphics and the raster images are a dud. What was disappointing was that the photo-objects all came from previous editions of Hemera's photo objects. So it's no use if you already have any of those photo-object editions.I think they could have come up with a more decent product."
73317,0,"Relative to many of the other languages offered through Rosetta Stone, the Mandarin package is very good. Rosetta presents all material using the continuous tense (e.g., ""The boy is running;"" ""The girl is laughing."") -- this is not conducive to learning how to conjugate verbs, which, in my mind, would make learning how to effectively use a lanuage very difficult. But in Mandarin, there is no conjugation of verbs, which makes learning through the continuous tense just fine.I have already studied Mandarin for a few years and lived in Beijing for a few more. I purchased this set with the goal of improving my reading and writing skills. In terms of reading, it's not bad -- definiately beats the tradiitonal learning method of going through blocks of text, dictionary in hand (using a dictionary to look up Chinese words can be very time consuming). That said, the software doesn't present any opportunities to practice reading more than one sentence at a time, or something that is out of context (the true test of lanuage mastery). As for writing, this package is useless. There is no input method for Chinese characters.So, for learning how to speak and improve pronunciation, I would say this series isn't too bad. For improving reading and writing skills, I would look elsewhere."
75237,1,This game is cool! Battle scenes make a clear picture of what Bull Run was.
84903,0,"I bought this product because I've switched from PC to MAC and have been using the PC product for many years.Migrating from PC to MAC was not a smooth process. Rather than use the same QDATA file format, it was necessary to export the transactions in QIF form. During the export process, Quicken for the PC warned that some account names would be truncated. During the import process Quicken for Mac refused to import those accounts.The user interface is quite a bit different than the PC version, so that's taking some getting used to. Some operations are just more awkward than what I'm used to."

33550,1,"As usual the PKWARE software makers have published an easy to use, functional file compression (decompression) utility. It is well documented by text files on the diskette. The program is a no brainer to install and use. The user screens and menus are a bit crowded but all in all it is a fine addition to your utilities library. Woud be nice if it came on CD rathewr than 3.5 disk."
16287,1,"I found the book to be very easy to go and fun. I really enjoyed working with the many samples from the book. My one complaint, however, I had a hard time finding some of the sample programs, files, etc. Either they were not on disk, or it was under a different name.Anyway, would I still recommend the book? Yes, I would."

43505,1,"Excelent product, it has everything you need to work at home or school, at a very reasonable price. I realy recomend it"
51422,2,This product is difficult to configure and when sending repeated requests for support I never got the help I needed. The responses looked like they never bothered to read my question. The response looked like a canned response that didn't relate to my problem. Like many products of this type they provide so much checking and blocking that performance is greatly affected. There are better products that are out there that are free. Seehttp://personalfirewall.comodo.com/
40228,1,The Kratt Brothers have a fantastic teaching friend in Zoboo! This product lives up to it's billing and the other reviewers . My son and I share an old MAC G3 and the graphics via Quick Time are gorgeous! The games are at perfectly matched to the attention span of their target audience - 3 - 6+. We found this deeply discounted...My 5 year old and I are very impressed. No crashing problems to report. EXCELLENT
58799,1,"While the box says novice it still takes a bit to get used to. I had some problems figuring stuff out in the beginning but after ""toying around"" with it i soon figured out what I was doing.You should definately have some experience with CAD software before using this. If not you should have some free time to waste getting used to how this works otherwise it can be a real pain. All in all though not a bad program. I just wish you could change the veiwing angle like mentioned before. but its something i can deal with.The moral of the story... well dont expect to plan out your dream house in just a few hours. And definately play around with it first before expecting to much. You wouldnt try to put your dream car togther without working on some other cars first right?"
65806,1,"I have this program from years ago and just bought a new computer with Vista on it. I installed it and it kept shutting down when trying to start it, but with the advice another amazon reviewer I was able to get it to work upon clicking during the intro.This program is not just for kiddos! The unusual tools allow you to do fun things with the media by double clicking over, for example, the crayon once you have selected it... it becomes a wacky melted crayon which you can do some cool things with.Once you have created fun or psychadelic images, you can actually export them and use them as artwork. Makes for snazzy computer desktop artwork!Even in spite of the troubles with opening the program sometimes, it's definately worth it!"

76891,0,"My 7 year old daughter loves the movie and was thrilled to see the game in the store. Setup of the game was easy and although she was new to adventure games of this type (pick up items, complete tasks, solve puzzles) she picked up on it very quickly. Graphics and sound are very well done, although the music can get annoying but it can be shut off. As mentioned before, Spirit needs to take care of Rain and in a short time, my daughter who felt sorry for Rain at the beginning was now saying ""Oh geez, Rain needs more water, Rain needs more food..."", but fortunately, this only lasts for the first quarter of the game. Once Rain is healed and feeling better she doesn't require any more help for the rest of the game. The goal of the game is to rescue fellow horses in the herd and the game can be completed in about 6-8 hours of play time. Sadly, there is nothing more to the game, no other adventures or variations if the game is replayed. Overall the game is well designed and fun to play, but could use a little more."
41954,1,"DVDXCopy does exactly what it says. To the reviewer above who complained about the fact 2 blank DVD are usually required to copy 1 DVD - of course! A blank DVD is about 4.7 Gb. The DVD's you own or rent are DUAL Layer (4.7 + 4.7) so of course it's going to require more than one blank DVD. This is NOT the fault of DVDXCopy. There are no DUAL layer blank DVD's available for consumers so now you see why the movies need to be split.Before you go off on a rant, do your homework."
88865,1,"I loved this sci fi 80's hit. The only thing that stinks about the DVD is that there are no extras. There were commercials, trailers and print ads that could've been thrown in as a bonus. the picture quality and color is sharp, now we can really see Diana's butt in those tight red spandex. They say this show might return to TV soon with the orginial creator at the helm. Let's hope."
32676,1,"If you are looking for a product that provides reasonable topography for camping, hiking, or just plain trail blazing, this is it! It is not intended to be used as a street map/guide although, it has most major roads. Amazon's price was great and I really enjoy the product. My one nit is the installation instructions should indicate to install all cd's on your hard drive then actually perform the installation. By doing this eliminates the need to insert a CD everytime you want to pull up a chart."

3484,0,"This 7.0 has bugs and will not work with newer library servers. I only purchased it because I was promised the $100 upgrade free when I bought. The latest version is worth the expense if you a student. Learn the program early and use it for taking notes on readings.I also recommend that you print annotated references often, because my computer fried and when I reinstalled the program (never version?) it did not reassemble the files. I lost EVERYTHING becuase I could not reassemble all the files."

7926,0,"I have long experience with this product and its earlier versions. It's wonderful when it works, but it's tempremental and Symantec charges $30 for the privilege if telling you &quot;we don't support that&quot; and &quot;you can't do that&quot;. Their &quot;free&quot; tech support time lasts about 9 seconds (60 days?), then they charge you to be unhelpful.It accounts for 80% of the crashes and reboots in my Windows 98 Peer to peer network.

67221,1,"This wonderful cd-rom will appeal to parents and children who wish to experience a gentle and at times surprising exploration of the alphabet. It's not didactic and users do not progress through it as they might with software that attempts to teach reading, letter recognition and phonics. This is all about exploration and fun. The art by award-winning Czech illustrator Kveta Pacovsk&aacute; is stunningly beautiful and playful. The animation is very interactive. In this sense, the experience is passive. If the users waits for something to happen, they will be disappointed. It's easy to use; just start clicking, You'll be delighted."
28249,1,"This program is great. Unlike many other genealogy programs, it can do many things that others can'tFor starters, it can read (directly) data from a number of other programs (TMG, FTM &amp; PAF among others) without having to be re-entered or without using an intermediate file (GEDCOM). It can create slide shows of the entire family to display during family reunions from its own files and/or from other files on the computer. The charts that can be created are excellent and can even be modified as desired by moving, adding, or deleting information on the chart after it is generated and before it is printed. The chart program used to produce the charts is an included free standalone program that is one of the better graphics programs available and by itself is worth the price of Family Tree SuperTools.My main use of this program is as a gift to some of my relatives and friends who don't use The Master Genealogist (TMG). This way they can read my data from TMG and compare it with their data from another program. A number of them have switched permanently to TMG which has even more capability than Family Tree SuperTools. But all have said they like this program.As for Customer SERVICE, I got it when I called the vendor for help. One relative happend to ask a question on the RootsWeb mailing list for Family Tree SuperTools and they received a phone call within an hour. Of course, not everyone will get service like that, but it impressed me."
32385,1,"Good creative software. There seems to be some unstability (minor). I'm sure Adobe is working on the patches.The differences between CS1 and CS2 appear to subtile for the most part. Adobe Bridge is one of the differences that stand out, and enhances all CS applications the way the file browser did for Photoshop.I am concerned that the packaging was nearly destroyed when CS2 arrived. Anyone could have looked in and nabbed it during the shipping process. I'm relieved the software arrived, but I wonder from time to time what would have happened if it hadn't."

9042,0,"This product has 8 different discs for different regions of the country. Unlike Street Atlas USA or microsoft's Streets Plus, you can't just pan from one region of the country to another. Well, actually, you can do so at a low maginifiction, all the discs contain the few large scale maps. But once you want to zoom in on an area not covered by your disc, the software will advise you to change discs. It's relatively painless, but not as nice as not having to do it at all. I haven't yet tried to get it to switch drives in a multi drive machine; my guess is that that wouldn't work. I note that there is a dvd version that does not require switching discs. I didn't know about that one; I might have bought it instead, but I don't have a dvd on my home computer, so maybe not.I didn't know this from the editorial or user reviews when I bought, otherwise I think I'd have gone for a different product. Now that I have it, I think I'll keep it but that's only because my state of Illinois is the only state that's on two discs, which makes it a little more convenient for me, if not for you.I haven't yet checked this out precisely, but I get the feeling that it doesn't show as much detail for the zoom level as StreetAtlas. In other words, to get all the street names, you have to zoom in further than on Street Atlas, and thus have to print off more maps.I find the product much more cumbersome to use than Street Atlas, but it also has the routing features of MapnGo, but not, I hasten to add, the all-North American coverage, which you'd think they could provide with 8 discs. Canadians and Mexicans beware. It has phone numbers of local business establishments like Microsoft STreets plus, which my '95 version of Street Atlas doesn't, and as far as I can tell, is fairly up to date. It has some streets near me that are new, but one of them is inaccurately portrayed. Some of the dashed lines, however, I know to be trails while some are gravel roads. It doesn't show all the gravel roads, however. The accuracy and thoroughness at high magnification is questionable.It comes up fairly fast, depending on your drive speed, and has much nicer and more regular-map-like colors than either Street Atlas 95 or Microsoft Streets plus 97. It comes in a little loose-leaf notebook that keeps the discs orgainzed; the plastic sleeves that contain them are easy to get the discs into and out of for quick changing. I like the notebook but it does take up more space than most newer software. There are some business features that I'll never use that may be important to some people.On balance, It's probably worth the $[money], but just barely. In my mind's eye, I'd like a product that covered the whole world with at least 14 really different (not just maginification) zoom levels, hiking trails in public areas, and street level detail for the US and Canada for less than $[money]. I'd be willing to live with a multi-disc product in that case. I don't know why no one produces such a product.Have fun-Wayland"
37855,0,"I just upgraded from Pinnacle Studio Plus 9 to version 10-Media Suite edition....Some quick observations after testing it on my PC. P4 3.1ghz, 1gb RAM.1) The first time I launched Studio 10, it was indeed slow as others have commented. I timed it with my watch--it took one full minute before the main editing window appeared. Subsequent launches were much better, however, at about 18 seconds. I would not like to see how this program runs on slower computers, or PCs with less RAM, or those with a zillion little icons (programs) beside the time.2) Needless to say, it's very important that you install the 10.5 patch! The patch does appear to resolve a lot of the issues people have mentioned here, although I haven't played with it long enough to know if it fixes *all* of them. There's also a small patch that you need to run BEFORE you install the MediaSuite upgrade (disc 4). Also, I got an error trying to install the bonus DVD content (disc 3), but the fix was to clear some temp files. This was all listed in the patches/downloads section of their customer support page at:http://www.pinnaclesys.com/PublicSite/us/Products/Consumer+Products/Home+Video/Studio+Family/Studio+Plus+version+10+Support/Download+Area/Drivers+-+Updates/Studio+10_5+Software+Update+%28full+version%29.htm?mode=documentsThe interface is pretty much identical to version 9. Other new features have already been mentioned, like the ability to edit HD and increased support for more video formats like DivX. I got the media suite for the extra format support, but there are other utilties in there that might interest some people, such as a sound/wave editor and photo management/file editor, plus some basic CD/DVD archiving program.There are several new transition effects, but I was disappointed not to see any new titles or (in particular) new DVD menus. The ones supplied are a bit dated, but I suppose you can always make your own. And of course, the nicer looking menus are all premium content. Just what people want to see when they pay $$$ to buy some software--buttons to unlock extra premium content for more cash.... :-( Pinnacle should compare their menus with those provided in Adobe Premiere Elements or even Apple's iDVD.I heard that they might have a 30 day demo of 10.5 on their web site soon, so you can always wait to try that. If you're happy with Pinnacle already and you have decent hardware, it might be OK for you. BUT DON'T FORGET TO PATCH!"
3215,0,"This is good software, but it expires too soon to be useful to a college student. I have two weeks in the semester left, now I have to use notepad and compile in jdk 1.3 because the Enterprise trial version expired before the semester was over.Why can't companies like Borland offer free trial versions of their software that will work through the entire semester for college students? A semester is not 60 days long, it's longer. Companies could ship the software with textbooks and it would be free advertising. As soon as the student gets a good programming job and can afford the real software, they'll buy it."

Yes you even do not need to know what ASP is. Onely one line:- You do not need to type single line for coding to master FrontPage 2000. Hasit Dave hasitdave@yahoo.com"
35829,0,"I am interested in buying this set of games but would first like to know how the controls work. Is it simply a point and click? That is, do you simply point the mouse in a certain direction and just click, or can you actually move around the scene with complete freedom of movement? And, if so, is it possible to use mouse invert? I tried a Myst game but it did not offer mouse invert (my style of play). For those who have windows XP problems just Google Windows XP Compatibility Mode. This is Microsoft's web page that tells you how to run older games under XP (this review section wouldn't let me link it here)."
17157,0,"Before buying this product, MS Virtual PC for Mac 7, make sure you have a Mac OS that this software works with. I thought I had researched this carefully before I bought. Microsoft's web site states the System Requirements are: ""Apple Mac OS X version 10.2.8 or later; Mac OS X version 10.3 is required for the Power Mac G5.""However, MS Virtual PC for Mac 7 does not work with Mac OS 10.5 or later. It installed on my Mac just fine, but it would not read the CDROM drive, so I could not install Windows on it. If you're running an old version of Mac OS X, it appears this software will work for you. Otherwise, you'll have to do like I did, and return the product."

The game is really fun and both me an my son enjoy playing it except for:*The graphics often become choppy making the game unplayable. There is a fix suggested on LEGO's website but it is not for the faint of heart. Judging by their technical support page there is a high number of compatibility issues with graphics cards.*The interface for designing cars is awkward and slow - pieces are hard to find and their size is hard to judge untill you actually try to put them in place.After playing a few races we loved it. Then after the choppy graphics problem occured for the first time, we were very frustrated with it. After a few hours of research and fixing it we like playing it again. Overall, it is lots of fun but the programming could have been better."
490,1,I have been working as a sound designer for almost twenty years and finally a program arrived that delivers everything I ever wanted (excluding midi). The problem with most digital audio software is working within their idea of a workflow. SOUNDTRACK PRO allows me to manipulate and experiment with audio the way a graphic designer works with images. Better writers than I have elaborated on the details so I direct you to Len Sasso's article in the September 2005 Electronic Musician magazine. You can read it online.Check this one out. It has been a long time since I looked forward to opening a program when it was time to work. No telling how many ideas I would explore that day!Paul Rajeckasrajeckas@aol.com

14933,1,"I don't know anything about the rebate deal that someone complained about. I don't understand how that review helps anyone - talking about the rebate. But to each his own.Listen, I have used this software on every single one of my photos in the past year. And I have gotten NOTHING but highest compliments on the photos. This is honest to God's truth!! I have a page on a very very popular website about dogs, and everyone has complimented the photos - everyone who has seen my page. So photo explosion and nova aren't THAT bad, huh?You can do just about anything with your photos. I have had this for a year or more maybe - time flies when you are having fun. And it is every bit as fun as it was the day I bought it. What's more? I keep learning new things every time I use it. I use this to make calendars, labels, crafts, iron ons, make gag sheets like magazine covers, id name tags, body switches, the list is endless of what you can do in the project area.As far as the photo part, WOW!! The list is endless there as well. You can morph, put stars (bright sparkling ones) bubbles, adjust transparencies, even put a very realistic spotlight on the picture and choose the colors of it. You can antique the photos, - make it part black and white / part color. I just LOVE Photo Explosion.So, why do I give it four stars then? Not because it isn't incredible, but just in hopes that Photo Explosion will use that to put more props in. I am a prop lover. And there are a lot. But for a prop addict like myself, I want MORE!!!! LOL!You know, I just don't like when people post reviews while they are emotional from ONE bad experience. I don't think that is fair to them. And I love this product. It really is worth it. Several people have asked where I make my pictures and I proudly tell them Photo Explosion. I came here to buy one for a friend in Scotland actually. And just had to make sure that you heard about the software and not about some resentful rebate confusion review. Have fun!!! You will LOVE IT! I promise!!!!!!"
88567,1,"My four-year-old plays more than 30 educational software games on a monthly basis (sometimes three a day before school in the morning and before bed at night). This one is a favorite of hers and so it is at the front of the CD-ROM Album. She started at the easy level more than a year ago and now she always does the hard levels. I (father) like the music and the navigation is much simpler than most programs provide. It still surprises me that she chooses to play it even though she mastered it long ago, but I can see that it teaches her good manners and sensitivity to others so I am happy to have the ""Clifford influence"" in her upbringing."
60969,0,"Disney software, unlike disney movies, is generally very poor. The ideas for the actual programs are excellent but getting them to work on anything other than ancient pentium based PCs can be a challenge to say the least. This would normally not be a problem if there were any type of software support. There isn't. Zero, Nada, Zilch. You get the idea. You will get messages like incompatable sound or must run in 256 color mode to name just a few. Out of 7 PCs in my home (I build them for a living) I can only get them to run 75% trouble free on one old Celeron 533. So if you're looking for trouble free software for your kids skip the Disney stuff and keep looking."

However, Nikon USA have a superb support facility, and I strongly recommend you contact them if you experiene any difficulties. Photoshop CS2 has a RAW converter function, but Nikon Capture 4.4 is far superior. The settings available in this product allow you to correct almost any error made in-camera - a photographer's dream. The ""capture"" element of the software however, would be a whole lot better if it allowed you to see on your computer screen the composition you would normally see through the viewfinder. There is now a new version available, Nikon Capture NX - it will sell as an upgrade if you already have Nikon Capture 4.4"
81364,1,"I use this program extensively. My husband is a contractor involved primarily in home improvement and/or additions. I use 3D Home Architect Deluxe to design the addition/change/improvement and we are able to demonstrate to the client, prior to beginning of work, how the finished project will look. It's an added plus for us as well as the homeowner. We attach an initialed copy of the plan to our contract to avoid any possible future disagreements about the original agreement. Some clients even come to my home office to utilize the ""3D"" element of the program and get a ""true feel"" for the project and make any final changes/adjustments based upon what they see. Altogether, it's a wonderful program with an excellent tutorial and easy to use.I have used 3D Home Architect Deluxe to design entire homes, not just for our clients but ourselves as well. I recently completed the design for a home we plan to build and it saved us major $$$ as I was able to present the architect with a highly workable plan which enabled him to provide our blueprints for a much reduced price.Highest recommendations to the contractor or those like myself who simply like to design homes."

5920,0,"It's better than TurboTax (which I used last year) because it's easier to navigate the interview in TaxCut.The help is equally bad for both programs, i.e. only answering most of the basic questions (but not all) and none of the complicated ones. The help does have some good examples, if your situation happens to resemble the examples.TaxCut's main advantage over TurboTax is price. It took me about 2 hours less than it would have taken to do manually (I estimate), which makes it barely worth the [monety] it cost.The TaxCut State program, for me, was a waste of money. Sure, there's a rebate to make it free, but the numbers it came up with were so improbably high that I ended up doing the state by hand. The state program apparently can't understand how one person could be a resident but the spouse can be a nonresident, so if you're not in this rare category it might work for you."
35734,1,"This is a worthy product, especially for those just starting to learn Mandarin. It is very interactive and can help build your vocabulary and speaking/listening skills. It is especially good for visual learners. However, if you are looking to learn characters, this program focuses on Pinyin, which actually works well for English speakers. However, Fluenz could improve this product by including characters. Maybe they'll do it in a future version. For now, I suggest Tuttle's Learning Chinese Characters for characters. I'm using Fluenz in conjunction with the Pimsleur series (which is great for speaking/listening)- and I think they compliment each other. Though it's not cheap, I think it's worth the money."

72952,1,"Great software for kids.I got this software in order to keep my kids safe from the dangers of the internet.One excellent aspect of this program is that it disconnects from ALL internet acticity at the specified times. Other applications (such as Cyber Patrol) only stop web page surfing, but Net Nanny 5 stops activity to MSN, Yahoo messengers etc.One slight problem is that the program recognized that I was entering a 'dodgy' site and told me that downloading would be stopped. But it carried on.However, you can get sent daily or weekly reports on any activities. You can also record chat sessions, or only record them when illegal words have been entered.Download the free 15 day trial first.Hope this helps."
57232,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

10771,2,"First, if you are a professor or a student, you can probably buy this through your university bookstore or on-campus computer store for 60 dollars. I'm at UCBerkeley and that's what it costs here.Second, once you've installed it, don't even bother registering it because it is not necessary in order to receive the upgrades. It took me 4 days dealing with some of the most catatonic ""Customer Service"" people in the history of the concept before I learned this fact (I didn't feel like joining ""Passport Network"" just to register my software.) You'd probably fare better with a geeky 12 year old little brother and the undernet, if you know what I mean.The programs themselves work well, (at least [Word]) AFTER you turn off all the ""AutoCorrect"" crap. Still, annoying are the little visual flourishes that pop up anytime you do something remotely different than what Microsoft thinks you should do. I don't need alot of ""visual stimulation"" when I write, so why does there need to be a little blue inchwormish thing creeping across the screen everytime I accidentally type ""nad"" instead of ""and""? And I hate the little dime-sized square things that pop up everytime I paste something, etc. I understand that for Microsoft's main customer base -- people that work in gray cubicles, all the pretty colors might really make the day seem alittle less fascist, but when you are trying to write a dissertation, or a love letter, or your last will and testament, all the annoying pop-ups become intolerable. This is a Word program, NOT Super Mario Brothers after all! I constantly feel like I am having to ""Slay"" things to get them to disappear from the screen. And not in a good ""Buffy"" kind of way, either.At least they got rid of the annoying ""Paperclip-shaped helper guy"" that was always irritating and creepy like the ""Hamburger Helper"" hand.REALLY, the ONE STAR has mostly to do with the absolute lack of anything remotely resembling customer service.

37314,1,"I recently got a HP 9700 Series CD Writer and it came with The Roxio / Adaptec software. I have had many problems with this software which caused windows to not run at all. After reading the reviews ofor Nero Burning Rom I finally decided to try the free download from ZDNet.This is the full version that only works for 1 month. I have been very impressed with this software. Many of the reviews I read hinted at the difficulty of using this program. However, I found that it is complicated but not that difficult.There are a few things that I wish to point out for other people lookig at this program. 1. It writes Both CDR and CDRW, I had a hard time finding this in the information on this site. As well as Music CD's, Bootable CD's and several other types eg. DVD 2. If you have trouble with Roxio / Adaptec software, Nero seems to work on those systems. While people having trouble with Nero seem to find Roxio more agreeable to their system. 3.Download the free demo from ZDnet first! I it doesn't work you aren't out much (Nero has a good uninstall program). 4. Many of Nero's features seem to be mostly fluff. If you have a program that works I would keep it. The label-maker is hard to use, the audio effects are pretty basic from and editing standpoint, but they do work. If you have burning software that works there are other programs that do these functions much better.I for one am glad I tried it."

If that is all you use it for, you are in good shape.However, it is obvious that this program was meant to be used with another photo retoucher. For instance, I tried to use the red-eye reducer. It was unresponsive (and I have a pretty high-end machine), and it completely destroyed the skin tones on my photos.My suggestion is to bring the photos in from the camera to a photo editor (I recommend, and use, Microsoft Picture It!

I am having a ball and Midinote Composer has helped me reach that goal.I enter the music I have been assigned (or my part of band pieces) in Composer. This allows me to practice more efficiently. For example, my Horn Teacher assigned several duets. I entered both parts in Composer. I can set up a practice loop, which will automatically repeat a specified number of times, increasing the tempo, from perhaps 80% to 110%. This allows me to start off slowly then increase the tempo as I gain facility. I can play along with both parts, or either part, by muting the parts as desired.I have some scanning software which has facilitated my data entry procedure. In addition, there is a huge amount of music available on the web. There us, for example, a classical music site. I have downloaded all of Beethoven and Mozart's symphonies and many more pieces of music. Even if I didn't have a band available to play with, I can now play my part in any of these.I can remember playing the Horn part to the William Tell Overture years ago when I was in High School (yes, they did have High schools then!). I can do it again now, something I never expected.There are a few wrinkles in MidiNotate Composer, but it is WELL worth the money, IMNSHO..."

A mischief named Marty and his minions want to take over a toy factory named Shady-Glen so he can famous and try to make the children admire him. Unless, you can take on the challenge by beating him to a strategy game that includes puzzles you have to find around the warehouse so you use as game pieces. The object of his game is to get your piece to the other side of the game board before he does. You come across rocks, mines, lakes and tall grass. I recommend you get this game! It's fun and it's well worth the challenge!"
83981,0,"Re Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007:Think of a pretty house (easy to use, nice maps) with a rotting foundation (data errors, crashing, bad routing) and you'll understand why I'm conflicted about this product.My particular area of concern is the lack of POIs (points of interest). Most good systems will have from 3-7 million points. S&T; 2006 had a meager 1.8 million points and generated many complaints because of it. So, what did Microsoft do for 2007? They actually REMOVED 600,000 points!! This is lunacy. Among other things, virtually all RV parks have been eliminated, making it useless for planning that type of trip. Many other points are still missing also, e.g. Wal-marts. My guess is that no one will pay what MS wants for inclusion in their precious map. Stupid, stupid, stupid.If something better came along, I'd dump this thing in a heartbeat. Problem is, all the others are worse. DeLorme has better data, but ugly maps and a weird home-grown user interface that's nothing like Windows or Mac standard. Rand McNally, etc. are not even in the same league. Online maps don't work too well when you're nowhere near suitable web access.The best map program ever is still the late lamented AAA Map&Go.; I could literally plot a cross country road trip in five minutes with this great product. DeLorme dropped it years ago, it didn't match their arrogantly misguided ideas about user interface. If they ever brought it back, I'd be first in line."
68218,1,"I really like this game, with all the fun features it is the best! I really like how it keeps the game quality but remains real! I love it. Although it would be only fun for kids 10 and older. It can be hard to understand at times but it is oh so much fun!!!!! Have a Clue of a Time!"

It would be impossible for me to sit here and describe you why Photoshop 6.0 is the greatest image editing tool to ever be installed on one's hard drive. I won't even bother trying. The layer editing features and new filters make this product stand out above the rest. Not to mention this is by Adobe!My only complaint is that this Photoshop seems a little slow compared to previous versions, but, don't let that put you off."
9035,1,"I just finished using Its Deductible to calculate the value of the clothing that we donated last year & it netted us another $199 in tax savings. It was very dificult determining ""fair market value"" on my own in prior years & this was a welcome helping hand. The only down side for me was that it did not have any provisions for people who donated automobiles (a minor problem). The program is also great for keeping track of cash charitable contributions as you make them instead of waiting until it's time to do your taxes. It also prints detailed reports on all of your activity."
22007,0,"I've been using this software for about three months now and have installed it on seven or eight different machines that I maintain, and honestly, the best I can say is that the actual upgrade process is very smooth.You will first notice how nice everything looks and the new &quot;Smart Pane,&quot; which is supposed to be a window with what Office thinks you will want to do. The contents of this pane include your most recently used documents and options to create new documents.The menus look a lot like the DHTML effects common on many web sites--menu options are &quot;highlighted&quot; when you mouse over them. A few other things have changed, but the changes are mostly cosmetic.The Smart Pane, which is really more of a &quot;pain&quot; than a &quot;pane,&quot; is obtrusive to me--I am what is called a &quot;power user,&quot; i.e., I use MS Office for about four hours a day, rely on it, and am very familiar with it. When I open an application, I want wide, open space. I often close the Smart Pane without using its features, instead opening documents the way I have for years-either by opening them from the Work menu I added or by clicking to them. This Smart Pane is supposed to close when you open something, but sometimes it doesn't, meaning I have to click to close it.Worse, the Smart Pane automatically opens when you want to do something it thinks requires many options. For example, if I want to modify a style in Word, the Smart Pane appears and offers me myriad options for editing my styles. This whole process of opening the Smart Pane slows everything down.Editing styles provides a good example of how bloated the software is. You may recall from Office 2000 that all the styles were either built in or created by the user. Now, however, XP creates new styles based on what it finds in your document. For example, if you have an italicized one of your Heading 1s, XP will show the regular Heading 1 style and the Heading 1 style with italics-you end up with way too many styles to load and look at!Word slows down every machine it's loaded on. My oldest machine, a Dell Pentium 75 running Win 98, was still chugging along quite nicely, even with Office 2000 installed. Now, however, after I've installed XP on it, it moves so slowly that it's almost laughable. The worst part is that the computer is much, much slower, even if I'm not using any of the XP applications.I have a few gripes with Word. First, I now have printing problems that I never had before. First, pages often print out at about 70% their regular size for no reason. Second, since I use a lot of hidden text in my documents, Word has a difficult time figuring out which page to print when I choose to print ""Current Page."" This has caused me many problems when I choose ""Print Current Page"" and later find out the printed page was several pages off. Third, a new feature, ""Manual Duplex,"" is not very useful. This feature is supposed to make it possible to select a page range, choose ""Manual Duplex,"" and then print out only every other page. Then, you take out the printed sheets, put them back in the printer, and Word is supposed to figure out automatically how to print the missing pages on the backs of the printed pages. Nice idea, but it only works if you have an even number of pages to print; if you have an odd number, which should statistically be half the time, it will not count the last blank page, and it will print all the pages ""one off.""The other gripe is almost laughable, typical of Microsoft. Now, when Word crashes, it politely tells you that it has done so and offers to send a report of the problem to Bill. It swears that it won't send any personal data. The first few times I saw this, I thought, sure, why not, send it, maybe it'll help. Hah! Each time, without fail, my computer froze! So, instead of having just one program crash, I ended up with a frozen machine. Remember, I'm primarily using a new, major name machine with little other software installed. Learned not to do that real quick!There is one change I do like in Word. Since I do a lot of editing for a living, I find the new style of showing comments much better than the previous method. In Office 2000, comments were shown as ""sticky notes"" that appeared when you moused over them. Now, however, the comments appear as neat rounded squares in the margin. They look good on the screen and they print out well for others to read.My relatively low rating is for the upgrade, not for the overall quality of the product. The product, which crashes at least as frequently as Office 2000, seems to be no more functional than its predecessor, meaning that the upgrade is necessary only for those who want to have the latest thing. The best news is that I've learned how to take advantage of MS's support discussion groups. The answers and workarounds I found in those groups were a thousand times more helpful than MS's pitiful Help or canned tech support messages. Again: Don't pay for support-go to their support groups for help first.In short, this is something of a ""non-upgrade,"" and will most likely cause more problems than it will fix."
78700,1,"In late 1999 when I discovered that the accounting program I had been using for 15 years was not y2k-ready, I searched the internet for another. I discovered Banana 4.0 and purchased it.I keep books for a small non-profit organization and also, having been a bookkeeper all of my adult life, I use Banana for my own personal accounting. It is easy to use and can be &quot;customized&quot;. I must say I consider it FABULOUS and the little organization is quite satisfied with what I am able to do for them.Being 75 and not as computer-literate as the younger generation, I have had need of Banana's support on occasion and must say that they are more than excellent in their responses. Once, one of the support persons lamented that her English was inadequate. Well, let me tell you, it is GREAT. You explain what you are having difficulty with and they promptly reply with the solution, always saying, write again if this is not clear. It IS clear. I recommend it highly. And over two years later they are still available to help me when I come up with new things I want to do with the program."
91460,1,As an xmen fan I found this product to be the best method of catching up with the entire back story. Being able to view the comics as published in full color was great. you could print them out if you desire but have to put up with the copyright watermark though every frame. By far this is the cheapest method of catching all these back comics and collectors books. A great addition to any fans collection.
21736,1,"Given all the negative reviews, I had to chime in. This software did exactly what it said, and what I wanted it to do...which was to allow me to transfer my music both to and from my ipod. Nothing more, nothing less. Granted, I'm not a computer whiz, but I actually have a job and wasn't able to spend any more than 30 minutes (to no avail) fiddling with free downloads or shareware before the $19.95 for 'tune transfer' was imminently worth very penny. If you can find something better / cheaper, then get it. That has no bearing on the performance of this software, which is just fine."
83266,1,"I agree that this is great software to use in a church office. I used it a great deal at my old job (church secretary). I liked it so much that I ordered it when I started at a new church. I just received it and was really disappointed that it didn't come with a print out of the images. Where I was using it before a book came with it, so that you could find the image and then go right to it, without having to browse through 2 discs to find the perfect image, especially since there is no search engine. I tried to contact Broderbund but since I ordered it at Amazon they will not support it. I finally got through to a human at Broderbund to see if I could at least purchase a book to go with it, I was told that ""the item is discontinued and we do not support it"". No matter what I asked he just kept repeating that same sentence. I told him that I had just bought it and he just repeated himself. I love the product but hate the attitude. Hopefully when you order this you will never need customer or technical support with it, or expect any books or manuels. The box just contains the discs and a booklet on how to install the Christian Graphics software. There is nothing included about the ""PrintShop"" or the ""Calendar Creator"", you are totally on your own with these."

61669,0,"I ran into errors displayed when trying to register the software. Wrote down the errors and called adobe, and adobe tells me to ignore the errors, the software is registered anyway. So far the product is working great for my required documentation project, but as usual with adobe products, the aftermarket need for additional manuals, training and tutorials is where the other 2/3 of the money is made. A product should have an in depth support and help system within the package you purchase. If the product has a feature, there should be an answer for all options in the product manual. I should not need to buy an aftermarket manual or visit an online support forum to find an answer to a question that should be in the product manual in the first place. I recommend the product in you need proprietary document formats or special document security for forms that the general public can access or needs to access. If you hope to get up and running in a hurry or need some help with the details, buy a little extra help, buy an aftermarket book on the product. The help information that comes with the product is frustrating for lack of necessary information, and sometimes the language to find the answers is frustrating itself. A little more intuitive menu help is all that is needed. If there is a name of an option or feature within the software, the same name should be in the help file index."
88384,1,"I purchased Home Designer Deluxe to help remodel my home. My wife and I are doing a major kitchen remodel and are considering moving some interior walls and bumping out an exterior wall. In addition to exploring different floor plans, we wanted to try different furniture arrangements for the living and dining rooms. Rather than hiring an architect up front, we figured we could explore many options on our own and minimize the architect's time. Home Designer Deluxe enabled us to do all of this. It is an excellent product for the price. It has a low learning curve and allows creation and modification of floor plans very quickly. But its biggest benefit was the ability to get a three dimensional view of walking through the house. The camera views give one a sense of proportion and mass, of openness and closeness. In the kitchen we tried different cabinet layouts and appliance locations and found some of the ideas we thought would be great looked terrible; and vice versa. I feel Home Designer has been instrumental in evaluation of a wide variety of remodel ideas and has given us a much better idea of what we want; and what we don't want.With any program there are limitations, most of which I could get around and most of which are included in the Home Designer Professional version. For example, I could not change the thickness of the walls so I found either the size of the interior rooms would be off by a couple inches or the overall dimensions of the house would be off. I opted to make the rooms their exact size so I would have their exact interior dimensions for the architect and let the overall length and width of the house be a bit off. I was not able to draw our angled walls in something other that 7.5 degree increments. But this was not a part of the house I was changing so it didn't matter. I was not able to create an angled staircase. Home Designer has some CAD tools but it is not a CAD program. When trying to so a site plan I found the dimension tools would attach to the roof lines rather than the ground level sidewalks I was trying to dimension. I also found dimension lines could not be attached to an arbitrary point on an object, the program always wanted to determine where to end the dimension line. So I drew my site plan with other tools.There is one major item that would be very helpful to include in this version of Home Designer Deluxe. The inability to change multiple similar items at the same time was very frustrating. I wanted to be able to change all the kitchen cabinets along one wall to add 4 inches to their depth, and I wanted to change their materials. I had to change every cabinet individually which was a lot of work given how many parts of each cabinet I had to change, multiplied by the number of upper and lower cabinets. It became very time consuming to evaluate more than a few different cabinet ideas. The ability to change multiple objects at one time would add a lot to this version of the program.Overall, it's a very helpful program."

57458,1,"I have installed this on a client's home computer to see how it compares with the other security suites--Norton and ZoneLabs--and was favorably impressed. This is the second edition I've installed; it upgrades the 2005 version previously installed. My only complaint so far is not entirely the fault of the program; installation on an AOL (I'm sorry) broadband connection that drops on restart confuses the install wizard. However, during the upgrade install it uninstalls the older version including the white- and black-list sites so you are forced to retrain the program. The client is not a sophisticated user (see the AOL reference), but did not have many questions or issues with the use of the program. I like to have an alternative to Norton as the sub-minimal level of non-support for Symantec's customer base has managed to find even worse levels of non-service."

14601,1,"Most people think you need years of schooling to put together a fully functioning web site. That's where FrontPage comes in along with all of its wizards and extensive knowledge base on-line. I started out using GeoCities and Homestead to get my first sites up and running quickley but since you need to be online to use their web site authoring software the phone line can be tied up for long periods of time. FrontPage eliminates that and you get some very useful and cool tools to play around with. This version will let those who want or need to play around the HTML code to do so. There are so many things you can do with FrontPage it's unreal. And for beginners it's nearly perfect. I have purchased several books that dig deep into what you never knew you could do with this program it has surprised me and I've been using it for 4 years. Each year Microsoft manages to add some new functions for each new version, though I wish some could be a free download. It's one of those titles you can have more fun with then you ever thought possible from a business oriented piece of software."

77128,1,"I've never used a GPS unit before, but with a two-week driving trip to the UK coming up, I thought it would be a useful tool. I was wrong; it was an INDISPENSIBLE tool. We got the UK map add-on, popped it in and we were ready to go. We changed it over to the British voice for fun and was a god-send. Seriously, if I could give this thing 10 stars I would.It saved my life on numerous occasions and lowered the stress level of driving in an unfamiliar country (on the left side of the road, with roundabouts instead of intersections, driving late at night and on rural roads!) to a minimum.One time we ran into some emergency construction work in Cardiff and we were unable to turn where it was directing us. However, it recalculated quickly and we arrived at our destination only a few minutes later.What I wanted was something to get me from A to B in one piece with a minimum of stress. This did the trick and then some. Considering that without this map we would STILL be wasting our vacation time arguing over paper maps and missed turns and trying to figure out the unfamiliar UK road system this little guy was worth twice the price I paid for it."

46658,0,"If you look on the cover of the box of the TOPO California you will see a picture of a Garmin etrex GPS handheld reciever. One would think with a picture of the exact same GPS handheld that one owns that it would work. It does not. The latest Garmin etrex uses an USB port to upload / download data to the PC which is not compatable with the TOPO software that uses the com1, com2 etc. ports. I wrote an email to TOPO asking how to correct this problem and they indicated that I could buy the expansion pack for the State series for about $20 and then it would work with my GPS reciever. So I went to their website to buy the expansion pack and it was priced at 24.95, and it is not availabe at this time. So it looks like I will be using Garmin's Mapsource product for all of my uploads to the PC. The problem with Mapsource is the level of detail. Its scale is 1:100000 vs. TOPO's 1:24000... But at least it works."

There are aspects of it that are really nice, such as the variety of vehicles. And there are power-ups. But the power-ups are almost totally random. The race courses have no secrets to discover. The brick sets for building cars seem more limited than the first.In short, I wish that they had expanded on the original, rather than trying to redesign altogether.Good points: Exploring the island and a bit of a story line.Bad points: More Luck-dependent Power-Ups, Almost No Shortcuts"

There are two types ofnits, things that could be done better, but are not; andbugs. I expect a small amount of both, however, I alsoexpect some level of support and update for bugs.On the ""It could be better side"" Namo is still a very goodproduct. Yes, they are week for CSS editing, and a fewother things. However, overall it is still a good product.Now, for the bugs. Well, quite honestly about the onlything that separates a big dollar package like Adobe orDreamweaver MX from the little products is support. Thebig guys have it, the little guys don't. One big issueis lack of good support for Netscape. Namo seems to haveforgeten that Netscape use is still almost as large as IE.However, several items which are advertised, do not workat all on Netscape.-------- Original Rating -----------------Wow! What more can I say? Few products live up to their billing, but Namo WebEditor 5.5 succeeds. On a feature for feature comparison, WE5.5 matches up with the big boys, including Adobe GoLive 6.0 and DreamWeaver MX. To be honest, I havn't actually used DreamWeaver, only read the reviews. I have however, used several web editors, including Adobe GoLive 6.0.Namo v 5.5 is more intuitive than GoLive, and seems to have all the features as well. For simple quick starts, it can't be beat, and for advanced site editing and maintenance it is great as well. The site manager is very good (as good as GoLive's), and the smart menu's, text and buttons are an incredible time saver.Too good to be true for $...! ...However, don't bother with Namo version 5.0. It has several bugs, and several of the great features in 5.5 are missing. For virtually the same price, forget version 5.0, get 5.5."

49254,0,"As with most all purchases from Amazon, the service was great! Now as to the product itself, the information on the package is a bit deceiving. The UPGRADE statement is only true IF you have Windows XP Home version on the computer. Once installed, the product seems a bit more difficult to use with significant changes to basic tasks. The graphics are GREAT! and the multimedia functions will be very useful. The RAM and vidoe card requirements are right on."
71812,1,"My daughter ""begged"" to have this program after she used it at school and it's become a favorite of my 4 year-old son as well. It builds basic skills by helping children to explore one step at a time, and encourages learning with graphics, enchanting characters, and storylines that keep them coming back for more. IMHO, this was a product well worth buying."
28632,1,"I like this game as much as my 5 1/2 year old daughter. She is a computer game veteran and this one is much different than the others. It took her about 1/2 hour to get the hang of it and now we have so much fun playing. I even like to play it! Hard to tell what it is like from the box description. You use the arrow keys to get barbie and two friends to do gymnastics routines. If you do not move the arrow keys as indicated fast enough you lose points. And you want a perfect 10!! Geared for age 5 and up I would think, I think 5 1/2 or older is best."
6394,0,"Between the sparkling reviews and the cast, I expected something a lot more substantial.The story line is promising -- what happens when kids seek out their ""biological father"" sperm donor and this disrupts a family's lives? -- but the movie doesn't deliver on its potential. Instead, it meanders, taking a lengthy look at this family with little real purpose besides a few soap opera moments interspersed with a lot of tedious daily life (along with some supporting characters who are so one-dimensional as to be all but pointless.) A better script might have helped."
32189,0,"First, the good news.1. The product worked okay, when I installed ONLY the program off of the CD rom [no updates/upgrades]2. Tech support responded quckly.The bad,1. Registration key problems. Your initial install, w/o a registration key, gives you like 15 days [or 30, I forget].Since it gave you like 15 or 30 days to get the key installed correctly, it wasn't a big deal. But it involved dealing with a 3rd party, Encore.2. I finally got my ZA4 Pro [the boxed version], registered, and it said I was good for 370 days.3. Then it went to auto-update. They offered a FREE Update/upgrade to a current version security suite. It was the ONLY update offered, so I took it.I installed the auto-update and it then reverted to a 15 or 30 day expiration. It started asking for a product key.4. and SURPRISE, the regular key [from the CD] is no longer working.5. a real pain-in-the-buttocks6. I removed everything associate with ZA.I re-installed ZA4 pro and left it. No update, no upgrades.It's working again, it has 370 days until expiration.I'm not touching it again, now that it is workngi."
41071,1,"As an instructional media teacher in an elementary school, I personally found this tool to be great for students who were assigned work to locate and re-draw a map of a specific country, as well as list important facts regarding population, religions, economy, history, major events, and a whole lot of other details. While this has not been updated to reflect the present world scene, it is still an excellent reference for any child who wants to have a copy of the country's map, as well as important information at his or her fingertips. Did I say that you can print information and maps from this CD?I know of an 8 year old who is fascinated with world geography, who would love to have this in her collection. Hopefully, the producers of this media will update it and give us a more recent edition.While I have my own copy, I have recently bought this for a young child who is enamoured with knowing about the world; it was available through Amazon's MarketPlace sellers.

VirusScan wouldn't update its DAT files.Through the support chat room, a very helpful support tech quickly found the source of the problem, which turned out to be a user error and not a problem with the software.After some very frustrating experiences with other companies' support services, my encounter with McAfee support was a breath of fresh air."

77246,1,"I upgraded from version 8 to version 9, and am very impressed with the improved accuracy. If you want to go hands-free occasionally or all the time, there's no substitute for Dragon. I'm a professional writer with a bad thumb joint, which is why I first started using voice recognition software, but then I found that it actually improves my writing by encouraging a loose ""first draft"" approach that I find difficult to accomplish when typing.Accuracy is improved a bit when I dictate into the ""Dragon Pad"" rather than directly into Microsoft Word, and copy and paste the text. But it does work in Word, Netscape email, Internet Explorer, Palm desktop... Just about anything you'd want to put text into.A NOTE ABOUT RAM: Dragon uses bucketloads of RAM. I started using it with just the 512 MG that my machine came with, but applications kept hanging up, and I couldn't keep multiple applications going at once, which is important to my work. So I bought and installed another gig of RAM (I probably only needed half that much), and now all is right with the world. (BTW, for those of you who, like me, aren't remotely techies, be advised that installing RAM is a snap. Just go online to your computer manufacturer to find out what kind you need. You can find instructions for installing it online or in your computer handbook.)Be advised that THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS APPALLING. I had to pay $9.95 to report a problem that was inherent in the software (for a while, phrases would come out upper-cased for no reason). The person who emailed me back made a coulple of generic-type suggestions that didn't work. Again, this was a glitch in Dragon's software, but I had to pay ten bucks to get someone to return my email. This is truly unconscionable. I'll stick with Dragon for now because they are literally the only game in town as regards this type of software, but the powers that be at Nuance should know that poor customer service is the best way to alienate your customers. If someone else comes out with comparable software, but better customer service, I'm there!HANDHELD RECORDERS: One real problem with this software: I bought the ""Preferred"" version hoping to be able to dictate into a handheld digital recorder and transfer the dictation to Dragon. I set it up correctly and trained Dragon to recognize my digitally recorded voice (you create a new user), but it resultant text is always a mess no matter how carefully I speak into the recorder or where I place the mike. This was a big disappointment.I'm giving this software 4 stars instead of 3 because it really does work very well, but I hope Nuance addresses the issues with customer service and the handheld recorders."

The story of &quot;Tootle&quot; was read with the same two repeating sound effects- very monotonous. The games are limited in their ability to challenge our 4 year old. He has a love of trains, and Tootle, so he does continue to ask to play this game. He would rate it higher than the grownups of the house!"
78648,2,"I agree with the earlier review by R. Cook that this program, although helpful in some ways, just isn't worth the money. It's very basic, and although perhaps useful to a very new investor to help organize his thoughts and investing strategy, if you're a more experienced investor, pass this one by. The quotes by famous investors such as Warren Buffett are sort of interesting, and the company report feature is useful, but overall, fifty bucks is about twice what the program is worth. At least for half that price it qualifies as an interesting but at least cheap diversion. Also, the package I got was the last one on the shelf, and it had obviously been returned since it had been opened and the CD removed from the paper sleeve. So whoever got it before me had returned it. I might do the same if they'll take it back."

27249,0,"This kit supports most newer phones. It comes with two USB half-cords, and several phone half-cords. One USB cord is actually a serial converter, the other one is passive. The software is an all-in-one package, offering phonebook/ringtone/image/calendar sync and internet dialer, unlike FutureDial's Snap products. The software is well laid-out, however, not all phones support all sync functions. Also, some phones don't support two-way communication - you may be able to upload images, but you can't retrieve them. I gave the product only 3 stars for two reasons. First, the website doesn't mention that some information cannot be pulled from the phone - it can only be pushed to the phone. Second, the package I received had a defective serial converter USB cable - and after having to sit through three customer service reps, who may or may not know what they are doing, on a line that was busy for most of the day, I had to spend more money sending the cable in for exchange. The price is right for all the cables that you get, but there's free bitpim software out there that does the same, and more."
64803,0,"Yes, the instructional chapters on Physics are fabulous. Yes, the graphics are stunning. And, yes, the overall idea for the game is admirable. However, I was still disappointed in the depth of overall game.Tying the puzzles of the game to principals of physics was such a great idea, yet, I can't help but feel that the designers came up way short on fulfilling that potential. Most of the puzzles are &quot;physics-related&quot;, but a lot of them just barely attain that distinction. One puzzle has you quickly matching a flashing optical lens to one of the four push buttons on the key panel in order to obtain access through a door. This is physics?Exploration of the landscape of the game was very limiting and disappointing as well. Several times I was disgruntled to find that not all directions of panning were available (sometimes you can't even turn around). This leads to the potential of NOT turning or panning in a not-so-obvious direction that ends up being very critical to the solving of the game.Also, the overall scope of the landscape is pretty small. With the exception of one &quot;elevator&quot; all other conveyance in the game is on foot. I was so excited to find a rail car on a track that leads down a hill into the town only to be disappointed to find out that you just walk down the track instead of riding the car. Also, I heard references to a submarine which I thought might convey you out to the island with the giant &quot;impellor&quot; device. But, no, the &quot;submarine&quot; is just a shell &quot;up on blocks&quot; with a generator in it. Bummer, I want to go somewhere else in the game!Oh well, its not such a bad little game, but it could have been a really great &quot;physics-bound&quot; adventure game."

34575,0,"hello!Catz 5, in my opinion, is a delightful and fun game. Why? Well, this game has all the joys of owning real cats and dogs, and you can have as many as you want, and not have to worry about messes on your carpet or hairballs on the floor. The graphics in the game are unique, and have a sort of ""Cartoony"" feel to them.The reason I gave this game such a low rating is that there are many, many glitches in the program.For example, sometimes when your cat has a litter the game crashes because the computer cannot take the new files of the kittens. Many times, I've had to re-install the game because it said it could not load the files. The sounds sometimes give out, so no vocalizations come from the cats or dogs. Ubi Soft has not taken time to create a patch for this problem.I would reccomend this game for ages 8-100"
52439,1,This is an amazing game. I have always loved Tom Clancy and to get the chance to be &quot;Ding Chavez&quot; and go get the terrorists is just too cool.

9172,1,"I waited a year to give this program a try because I read so many poor reviews. I installed it last night on WinXP SP2 machine lots of RAM.Worked fine after a reboot (many programs are like that).Contrary to what others say, you can have many maps on a card. Note that my Meridian Marine will not read a 2G card, so I put my maps 3 of them on a 256. I am doing a 512 today. I kept each map smaller than 50Mb because I don't want to sort between 500 main streets when looking for a place. I have split Calif Nevada into two sections, and a third map for OR & WA. If I leave those 4 states I will make up a new set of maps.To get it to work well define and name some regions, say 3 of them (but you can do more if you want). Select upload to GPS (do not connect gps). Program will give you a warning message and you allow it to save to the hard disk. Then put an SD card into a reader (a USB 2.0 unless you have a lot of time on your hands) and select one of your regions and hit upload. It will upload it to the card. Open up explorer and rename the region from detail001.img to so_cal.img or whatever fits your map. and close file explorer (or minimize it) then upload the next region, rename it on the card and repeat until you have uploaded your regions. I make my home region alphanumerically first so the gps defaults to it. To change maps go to menu, card utilities, (I think it is called) you can change detail maps from there.The program worked fine for me. Copy protection requires you have disk 2 in the drive when using the program a pain, if you scratch the disk but they have to keep it protected some how. I assume you better be carefull in entering the gps's id or the maps wont work. Other than that seemed to work well. Worth the money, and considering that the Meridian GPS units have been out for a while before the routing program I was impressed that they added the functionality without demanding you purhcase a different GPS.CONS: Memory card size limit., Cant route across two map images and unlike the garmins will not use the basemap for routing.They don't have the topo overlay on the routable maps (no compeditors do either).routes don't allow the customization that the garmins do.Don't automatically reroute when you miss a turn or detour.Merridians don't have voice instructions or intersection preview details like the garmins.Still for the price and that it retrofits an older gps it is a good deal!"

4108,1,"Jaguar is significantly faster than 10.1 and takes advantage of hardware acceleration for some systems, including the Powerbook DVI I'm writing this on. I am hearing-impaired and was glad to see that there are options for disabled users -- being able to have the screen flash so that I don't have to have my hearing aid on to know I'm being beeped at is a plus.Jaguar also has a more plasticky look to some of its interface components, such as some toolbar buttons and list menus. It does not, however, include that updated slick look on window close/min/max buttons or scroll bars, but I've improved this with a thirdparty theme. Menu Extras don't work in Jag without a thirdparty utility that, fortunately, is free. Such inconsistencies are relatively minor and hopefully will continue to clear up in the future. Rumor has it that 10.3, Panther, will include further speed boosts.Areas that could stand improvement are its inclusion of Internet Explorer as the default browser (fortunately, far easier to remedy on Macs than Windows; just drag it to the trash after you've used it to download your browser of choice -- with the thirdparty Pinstripe theme, Mozilla looks great on my desktop); the Terminal client could use better ANSI color emulation, though relatively few users will find that a problem; the number of built-in color schemes is limited to just the standard scheme and to a Graphite scheme that's designed for graphics artists; and the built-in firewall needs a friendlier interface. This can be fixed with thirdparty utilities, but unfortunately, the good ones aren't free.Still, 10.1 is a very good operating system -- it's rock solid, and doesn't have the antitrust and security problems of a certain other OS. I don't have any major gripes with the system, and I love being able to make full use of the BSD subsystem that's hiding underneath and many users don't even know about. With the Developer Tools installed, I can even compile the vast library of GPLed Unix software out there.If you are in the market for a computer and have the cash, get a new Mac (you'll get Jaguar with it.) If you have 10.0 or 10.1, go and upgrade. Now."

In most cases I was in familiar-ish territory and was surprised by the routes taken and in one case over a 5 mile journey I was sent towards a no-entry sign and an illegal u-turn, which were restrictions in place well before 2007. I haven't explored too many big metropolises in the US but had never had these sorts of problems!?Saying that, it does install fine onto the GPS and didn't get lost!"

It is also very stable with no gliches or crashes (I'm running Win2K).People are contantly amazed at the videos I produce with this software. This is the best program out there in terms of features, felxibility, and cost and I have tried them all (Ulead,Pinnacle etc) .

Then it suddenly began to start up with an update error window stating ""Invalid registry key"". And it wont't update or install again. I had used an earlier version and had problems years ago, and ended up reintalling Windows, which I may have to do again. Be very cautious about using any product which alters the MBR of your hard drive. In addition, when I initially was offered this program since I had another product from them, they offered to give me 2 additional programs for free, but did not do so.

3869,0,"It's called Microsoft Streets and Trips 2008, but the maps are probably five years old. It's mostly accurate. I would say the positioning is entirely accurate, but since several of the roads we travel have been rebuilt or built since the maps were last updated, it sometimes shows us driving through a field, where the new road or modified road has been built. It's a minor annoyance, and I haven't run into an issue that I oouldn't figure out a way around, even using the outdated maps. The routing sometimes isn't what I would choose, but by adding waypoints, I can always get it to go in what looks like a more efficient manner.The USB adapter for the GPS sensor is junk, and the reason I had to purchase the 2008 version was because when the adapter broke on the 2007 version, it was cheaper to buy the program with hardware, than to replace the broken part. It looks like a $5 piece of plastic and is as flimsy as a $1 piece of plastic, but when You can finally find it, it costs $40 plus $12 for shipping for a replacement. Be very very careful.Still - it's a functional GPS, and I can plug the speakers from my laptop into my radio and and adjust the volume so that I can play MP3's and still get the announcements of the next instruction through the radio.It's still a cheaper option than the 3 inch screen portable GPS's."

The slow play drove me wild, but they didn't seem as bothered by it. For example, when you click on a doorway, to get Max to go there, you don't just go- a voice over says, very slowly, &quot;should Max go through the doorway into the cellar? Yes [a thumbs up appears]or No [a thumbs down appears]?&quot;, then you click on whichever you want, and the same voice says the choice you made (yes or no), and then you can go through.

63682,1,"UPDATED JANUARY 2012With OS X Lion and improved syncing capabilities, new versions of Daylite and switching to BusySync, I've resolved all the sync'ing issues mentioned below. Now, I can manage all my appointments, sales opportunities, projects and tasks in one package. A really lovely thing to use! There's nothing on the market that does it all like Daylite, at least for my life. I could have cobbled together individual parts and pieces, but it's so much nicer to have it all in one place.PREVIOUS REVIEW FROM 2010I bought Daylite a couple months ago, and have been exploring its functionality extensively. I manage dozen of projects and opportunities. I used to use ACT!, and was the system administrator, so I had lots of experience in setting up, troubleshooting and using a full-featured CRM. I also had a fair amount of experience with their technical support team, since I migrated data, and set up about 20 users with geographical territories and rules.However, I use a Mac and prefer using Mac software. Daylite has a lot of great features and reporting functions. The degree of customization is great, allowing the user to customize almost every drop-down menu and category. It takes time but it's no harder than other software I've used. The interface is better than ACT!. Daylite Mail Integration is great! And I've had no issues with lost data although I struggled for some time with multitudes of duplicate contacts, before I disabled sync'ing.Sync'ing with Address Book and iCal has been nothing short of a nightmare. I've spent at least 25-40 hours troubleshooting sync'ing, in spite of the fact that I spent $200 on a Premium Support Package for Daylite to get ""Premium Help"" for 3 months. While the techs are nice, the Premium Service has not been worth it in terms of providing solutions.I gave up trying to sync contacts (I have about 3500) since the interface between Daylite and Sync Services (an Apple product) is seriously flawed. I have completely given up trying to sync contacts. Now, I import the contacts I need manually, which is not so hard but annoying to have to do it. Note that I easily sync 3500 contacts with Google Apps and my phone without issue using Spanning Sync, and so I know it can be done well. To get around not being able to sync, I now import new contacts using WhoPaste, a great program, into both Daylite and Address Book simultaneously.I'm now struggling with iCal sync'ing, and so far it's no more functional than Address Book syncing! Reading through the tech support pages on the Marketcircle site, I find others that have my problems too, but it appears that many do not as well. Not sure what that means.At this point, I still have hope for Daylite, and I want it to work. It promises great things and will be valuable when the company fixes the small number of fatal flaws."
91950,0,"This game was a bit disapointing, compared to all the other Nancy Drew games. I know that HerInteractive always likes to include some sort of history in their games, but the way they put history into this game was totally unrelated to the original mystery. Once the prospect of hidden artwork from WW2 came into the picture, the mystery behind Minette was basically forgotten. Just seconds after Nancy solved the 'history-mystery', the REAL mystery came back in full swing, knocking me off my feet, only to disapoint me yet again. The reason behind Minette wearing the mask was so dumb and incredibly lame that sometimes I wonder if I dreamed it all up, and that I never really finished the game. Unlike other ND games, there really was no 'culprit', unless you count Minette, and a person that you only hear from once throughout the entire game. One of my favorite parts in a Nancy Drew game is interacting with suspects, and you could hardly ever do that in this game. You could hardly say anything to anyone.This was the first game I played where you handled money, and I got terribly bored after a while. There were many, many things you had to buy in this game in order to sucseed, yet only one way to make money. Painting pictures. I felt like I was playing 'Madeline's Thinking Games' all over again.Don't get me wrong, the puzzles in this game were very good, and so were the graphics, but the ending got me sooo disapointed. It was just one of those games where you think, ""How is this going to help me solve the mystery?"" before realizing that you left Minette's mystery in the dust long ago, and you're now trying to find hidden artwork.Overall, I was pretty disapointed with this game. The game setup was good, and I liked how the ending varied on whether you did or did not get this paticular person fired, and the puzzles were spectacular, but other than that? This game totally flopped, especially the ending. There was totally no way you could've predicted what the ending was going to be, unless you have ESP. If you're a person out there looking for QUALITY Nancy Drew games, I don't reccomend this one."

The interface is a little too jazzed up for a graduate student, there is no print function and the scores earned are lower than actual, but I think this package on the whole is worth it.I used this CD as my primary means of learning. With the customized learning program it lets you concentrate on what is important to you. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to learn at home."
73330,0,"I take issue with Fairfield Language Technologies' claim that the Peace Corps and State Department uses this computer program.I just completed the State Department Chinese language course and I never saw any teacher nor student use this program. Perhaps it is used with other languages that were taught at the Foreign Service Instutute, but not Chinese.As a former Peace Corps trainer, I find it hard to believe that Peace Corps trainees would use this program. Trainees spend at least four hours a day in language class and then spend their evenings staying with host families. The idea is to get out and interact with people, not with a computer."
9771,0,"Mortal Kombat, by the measuring stick used to grade video game movies, is still contender for best adaptation ever. Some have come close (Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Silent Hill), but Mortal Kombat really retains the feel and story of the game while making logical changes, extensions, and even adding (gasp!) character development in places. The movie takes itself seriously enough that the plot is given weight, but not so seriously that it falls on itself. It's pretty good as a Saturday matinee B-movie, and the memorable techno theme song helps keep the energy level high.I guess a few things haven't aged well, and those would be the special effects and the fight sequences. The CG stuff looks primitive by today's standards, though the art direction is still good. The fight scenes are still effective, but after seeing multiple Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee flicks, you'll pick up that most of these guys aren't trained in much besides the basics. The Johnny Cage vs. Goro fight is also framed from a ridicuously far distance away.Overall Mortal Kombat is recommended. If you're a fan of the series you owe it to yourself to check it out at least once, and its worth looking into for anyone that likes cheesy kung fu cinema."
31401,1,"We are a retired couple hoping to learn Spanish to make travel more enjoyable. Using Rosetta Stone you hear the words/phrases, see them written, and see a picture showing the word or action. You can speak the language and write it. It provides lots of review. We were afraid we would not have the self-discipline to use the program everyday. However, we are finding this not to be a problem. You can use it for short periods of time, or for longer if you want. My goal is to understand and make myself understood in Spain. My husband's goal is to become fluent (he took Spanish in high school and college, but never got fluent). Unlike ""school"" Spanish Rosetta Stone does not bog you down with grammar rules. Also, the speakers speak excellent Spanish, not with American accents as many of our teachers did. We think we can reach our goals."
59550,1,"Does what it is meant to do. Surprisingly stable given than it isn't secured to the dash. The mapping software is good. It covers the whole US. I tested it against my preferred local routes and it tended to use main roads rather than short cuts. Also, one time, the route recalculation algorithm tried to send me right when it should have sent me left. I suppose this is a function of the GPS itself rather than the mapping software. To be fair, it has been pretty reliable apart from that one event.Overall, if you have a handheld GPS and want to expand it for road trips, I think this is great. I don't regret spending the money I did on it."
55230,2,I don't have a real heartache with the product activation except for what happens when a company goes bankrupt and you can now longer use the software. The real headache I have with the software is that it installs a background task that runs all the time whether you running turbo tax or not. And it does not uninstall when you uninstall turbo tax. It clutters your root directory by creating a director called C_DILLA (sounds like a virus name to me).

It took a few hours to back up 25gig, but I could still use my system while it was doing it. It is early days yet, but it seems to do what it says on the tin. I especially like the way that it automatically backs up files that I have modified or created while not on the network.It does have a couple of inconveniently missing features (e.g. the inability to move to a different backup target without creating a whole new backup), but another thing I liked was the very fast response from their support line when I asked how I could do this (even though the answer was, ""you can't"").The bottom line is do not be put off by the lousy reviews that seem to be based on older versions."

This a little annoying at first, but once you know it its easy enough to zoom in and make sure its just right before finalizing it.My main issue with the tool is that I have not yet found an easy way to copy a paint color/transparency/brightness/etc fromm one layer to another. I have to pick the color for each layer manually. This makes it take longer to match up the colors that I want to be the same, as I am still trying to determine if the trim should have 2, 3, or even 4 colors."

But if I back date my computer to 12/31/2003 it opens just fine. I spent some time with the chat support and they told me that I will have to use Quicken's disaster recovery service, $200.00 and 10 days-yea right. It's too bad because since I upgraded I spent about 40 hours entering in Budget and Plan data which will now have to be reentered. My only hope is to use my backup and go to 2003 and take a good look at going to Money. Intuit really screwed this one up and their support has been even worse."

I'm now a strictly Keynote user as far as the Mac goes. Rating: 6/5Pages: I'm trying to use it, but I find certain tasks to be, well, clunky. I think there are things that are promising. I like the simpler interface. I like the automatic object line up. I like the inspector, for the most part. I would like a little more customization in the buttons (like more options, or build your own). One grip: I teach chemistry part time, which means I need easy access to superscripts and subscripts, I've got the buttons up on the 'bar', but there is no highlighting on when the button is active or not. I'd like more control over numbered lists and outlining. Maybe a little more learning curve than I like. Rating for Pages: 3/5Numbers: I haven't used it a whole lot. Graphing doesn't seem to be as complete as Excel. But I think this will work. Rating 3/5Overall, I think if Apple continues to improve this product, it will be pretty nice. I'd like to see a little more work on Pages (mostly customization on the buttons), but otherwise not bad. Also moving to/from MS Office is a little clunky (import/export?) why not just a 'save as' option?"

Aswell as there are things that I still miss in such kind of programs (But it happens also with most of the competitors ones. And if any those ones have included such particular function or ability, those ones are just the most expensive ones).Honestly, FloorPlan has evolutioned hand by hand to its users.Sometimes non CAD or 3D Desing experienced users may find some difficulties to do their 1st. steps.

7394,1,"This version of Works 2006 is the retail version, just as you see in the picture. BE SURE YOU ASK THE VENDOR if what he's selling is just like this picture; for sadly, many vendors here sell the OEM version instead, which will NOT work on your machine. Instead, get this RETAIL version, which is just like the picture.The OEM version, instead comes in a small CD-sized box, or is in a jewel case, and does NOT look like this Amazon picture. It was packaged with PCs sold, was installed on a PC already, and it WILL NOT INSTALL on another PC. So you need the retail version, which again looks JUST LIKE the picture (i.e., red on the right-hand, lower side in the picture, for Encarta).I just bought this retail version from a vendor in Amazon, and just installed it to my Vista machine. Just now tested it with Windows 8 Upgrade Advisor, and the Advisor said it will work in Win8 (32-bit). It will also be compatible with Works Converter 6-9, which is a file converter program you can download for free from Microsoft. This matters, as it means you can keep using Works 2006 and still read later versions of Word files.But Win 8 Advisor also says that Word 2002 will not work in Win8. I get contrary feedback in PC World forum, users claiming that Word 2002 runs just fine on their Win8 machines. If you go to MS Answers forum, you are universally told that Word 2002 will not work in Win8. I'd believe the PC World folks, because they were disputing with me about this topic, claiming they were actually USING Word 2002 (and even Word97) on their Win8 machines. So maybe you should take the claim by Win8 advisor against Word 2002, with a grain of salt.Now to what Works 2006 has. The main reasons to get it -- especially at this price -- are three: 1) the Calendar is decent (though Vista but NOT Win7, has a built-in calendar), 2) Word 2002 here is the full version, not pared down, and is better than later iterations of MS Word. It's really important to have MS Office 2002 and prior, and Word 2002 is part of that. The importance is two-fold: a) most law firms and other businesses still export documents in older Word97-2003 format, which later versions of MS Office, no longer support; Word 2002 can read even older files, which is vital to anyone who keeps records from years ago (tax, legal, financial, etc.), even back to DOS. Later versions of MS Office do not support these older files. So via Word 2002, you can convert them. Some old spreadsheets cannot be read by Works either, but then you can get Excel 2002 and perform the necessary backwards-compatible conversion, so later MS Office can read the old files.3) the Digital Image Standard photo editor is the successor to Picture It 9 and 10, and is the easiest photo editor I've ever used. (I make a bunch of videos as brainouty in Youtube, so being able to edit a photo or graphic is important.) MS Works is the only way to launch it.Works itself has a limited database and spreadsheet function, which is okay for home use; you can usually send spreadsheets to business users (i.e., to your accountant for preparing your tax returns); but often you will not be able to read a spreadsheet sent to you from a business (because Excel uses three spreadsheets in a book, but Works can only read the first one, and even that, not too well).Works even has presets of projects you'd computerize for your house. For work, it's not too useful, but there are die-hard Works fans who use it in a small office. I'm not one of them, but you can read reviews on Works here in Amazon, explaining how useful they find it at work.The other things in the Works suite are all outdated now: Encarta (useful, but old), Streets and Tips and Money.In short, especially for this price, it's good to buy Works 2004-2006 et seq. But be sure ONLY to get the retail version, which is in a plastic clamshell case, 7"" tall by 5.25"" wide.The OEM version is NOT what you want to buy (cardboard case, same size as a jewel case for a CD). It will not install, except on the original PC with which it was sold preinstalled.I posted the permalink to this review in PC World, to ask others who disputed with me, to come here and comment on how they can use old MS Office, in Win8. That might be important to you. Some of the people there are trolls, so will make useless comments. I can't help that. You will be able to distinguish between the useful posts and the trolls, I'm sure. Hope this helps: for sometimes, old is still better, than new."

57907,1,"It never ceases to amaze me how people decide to denigrate a product because of &quot;trouble&quot; with a vendor (shop someplace else!), customer support (is any of it good these days?), unrealistic expectations (a $20 software program isn't a $75/hr financial consultant), their system problems (when was the last time you ran disk clean-up?), etc. Let's stick to reviewing the PRODUCT, shall we?OK, TaxCut Deluxe is a real bargain. It's consistently cheaper than Intuit, does as good a job (yes, I've used both), saves time and money by filling in a ridiculous number of tax forms, electronically transmits everything (getting you a faster refund), and pays you back for the cost of one e-file and the state version. So it doesn't meet ALL of the people's needs ALL of the time ... what product does?! It has always handled everything I could throw at it, and has caught things I know I would have missed without it. I can't give it 5 stars, because of a minor input glitch (the program would jump back to the top of a column whenever I clicked the next box in one input screen), but otherwise, it was fast and easy.Now, if you want to gripe about other things, use online forums. Amazon has ALWAYS been a straight-shooter with me, that's why I keep coming back! I've used countless software programs, yet consistently have problems with only one manufacturer (#@!* Microsoft!).

12630,0,"Windows XP is great but there is one thing you need to know: in order to use this product, you will be forced to contact Microsoft (by phone or via internet) in order to get an &quot;activation code&quot; after you have installed the software. If you don't do this, you will no longer be able to use this product after 30 days. In order to get this activation code, you will have to send Microsoft a code made up from the different pieces of hardware on your computer. You have no choice in this matter. They will then give you an this activation or &quot;unlock&quot; code in return. If you change the hardware on your computer beyond a Microsoft-specified amount, Windows XP will suspect that it is now installed on a different machine and will demand that you apply to Microsoft for another activation code before you can continue using it.If their database shows that you have already &quot;activated&quot; this software before, they will demand a reason why you want another activation code. If they think you are trying to install the software on more than one machine, they can deny you the activation code, thereby rendering the software useless.

94070,0,"Well, to make a long story short I purchased Nero and then had a hard time getting everything installed without crashing my system. I had to reformat three times as I attempted to complete the entire disk contents to my hard drive. In frustration I removed it and purchased the Roxio Cd Creator 5 Platinum. Installation was a breeze and everything was going along well until I tried to do a disk copy of a copyrighted cd. The scan process would not go past track 9, where, it would just continue to scan and scan and scan. Originally, I wanted a program that would burn pictures from my digital camera to cd so I could send the family the latest. The process that is involved to get the pictures to cd with Roxio Cd Creator is confusing and complicated for a non computer person like me. With these two problems at hand I decided to give Nero 5 another chance. By NOT installing packet writing and easy reader, installation was a breeze. Making cd copies is no problem and doing cd pictures is as easy as one could hope for. I must admit that my abilities to do this succesfully were a result of exploration of the two programs. I am sure that for many, Roxio Cd Creator 5 Platinum is a fine program , but, for me I am going to stick with Nero 5. It's faster, easier, and very versital. That's it for now.

22358,1,"I have used Audio Cleaning Lab 3.0 on two projects so far: to clean and digitally master a noisy, twenty-year-old recording of an interview with my great aunt; and to transfer an album (also twenty years old) from cassette to CD. My verdict: Audio Cleaning Lab is an excellent tool, albeit with a few quirks and one notable flaw.The quality of the original interview recording -- made on a cheap, portable cassette recorder -- was awful. Some of it was virtually inaudible. Although Audio Cleaning Lab couldn't polish it enough to make it sound like a studio-quality recording, it did eliminate considerable hiss and hum, allowing barely audible portions to become understandable. It also turned the flat mono into a more-expansive sounding stereo signal. The final recording did exhibit a subtle electronic quality, but overall it was much improved.The album, from an off-beat group called Daniel Amos, was a label-produced cassette. Of course, twenty years ago most recording companies used some of the cheapest-quality cassettes available for this purpose, so sound quality and durability were not the best. Even so, I eliminated virtually all tape hiss and brightened the somewhat flat sound quality. The result is a high-quality digital recording comparable to a present-day, commercially produced compact disc.There are a few quirks with Audio Cleaning Lab: produced by a German company, occasionally the English instructions are curiously worded, though almost always readily understandable. Some of the tools, such as the cutting tool, are a little difficult to work with.And the biggest flaw: its CD-burning functionality is incompatible with Adaptec/Roxio's DirectCD and other packet-writing applications, which are installed on many systems with CD burners. The workaround: either uninstall DirectCD or create all files as WAVs and then master them to CD in another application, such as Roxio's Easy CD Creator. Not a very satisfactory workaround.All in all, an excellent application with some room for improvement -- and room for a patch that will allow it to burn CDs _without_ uninstalling packet-writing software."
48485,2,I have windows XP SP2. My CD drive doesn't recognize this CD. It says either CD format is different or corrupt. I ordered for a replacement and even the replacement CD it is the same problem. I never had problem with any other CD.There is nothing in the Technical support. I returned my CDs.
18272,0,"This product contains a wide variety of public domain literature, organized by author or type. But it comes across as rather cheaply made (odd capitalizations, word breaks)--it looks like someone cut and pasted the data from somewhere else, and didn't bother to reformat it afterwards. It's fine for the price, but I'd hardly call it a polished product."
18293,1,"I don't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it. It is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did....and realize that you forgot to select ""test"" at the beginning. Also, it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also ...... not just the regular exercises. Other than these two things, the program is very good."

69270,1,"I was looking for software that would let me do two things:1. easily burn cds with the ablility to control the transition between songs (crossfade songs, fade in/out, control the amount of ""dead space"" between songs)2. cut out pieces of songs (stop a song halfway through, edit out an intro, etc.)This software easily did both. I am now using it as my primary tool for burning music cds. Now my cd compliations can have whatever transition between songs that I choose.I had a hard time choosing cd burning software for a few reasons. Most of the packaging doesn't clearly explain what the product can and can not do and most online reviews for software are horrible. After reading horrible reviews of other cd burning programs I assumed that installing this program would cause fatal errors on my 2 year old Toshiba laptop. It didn't.The photo editing software is mediocre, as far as I can tell, but that's not why I bought the program, anyway. I don't burn DVDs yet, so I can't comment on that feature. However, if you want to quickly and easily burn cds and have more control over your playlists, this is a good value."
47348,1,"I bought Memeo backup software because it came bundled with a SeaGate external hard drive that I had purchased. I had trouble with installation. I emailed tech support several times, and they promptly answered by emails, but I still couldn't get it to work. Finally, they set up an appointment to phone me and fix the software remotely. The tech called me exactly at the appointment time and very quickly fixed the problem. It's now working great and backing up my files."
53113,1,"Don't be fooled by the product description which makes it sound as if this application is written for entry-level animators and hobbyists. It's not. This is a professional-level application. We introduced this tool into the production pipeline of our animation shop and we love it!The ability to actually *rig* a 2D character for animation is fantastic enough. But then to be able to have vertice-level control too is mind-blowing! This doesn't even take into account the: particle system, or the depth-of-field rendering, or being able to move through 3D space, etc.While the overall documentation may be a bit thin, the Anime Studio support community is strong and very willing to quickly answer any question. I found the Help File tutorials to be strong with the right amount of to-the-point brevity that quickly enables a new user to feel confident enough to begin creating right away.And the price. How can you beat the price? Less than $200?! That's the same amount you'd pay for you and ALL of your executive buddies for lunch at 'Macaroni Grill'. Or....an evening for you and 2 of your buddies at ""Cheater's Lounge"". But anyway....If you do *any* kind of 2D animation, do yourself a great favor and try this program. The last time I was this excited about a piece of software was back in 1996 when I started to hear a buzz about this goofy little animation program called ""Flash""."
48722,1,I have been using this since 2005. It has proven to be a reliable program and is full featured. 2007 has had a couple of problems the main being when used with Spybot one of the modules in PC-Cillin becomes a CPU usage hog tying up the computer. Trend had a workaround that worked but wasn't the best. The other was that to renew the subscription was more expensive than buying a new program at Amazon.The firewall is good. It asks if you want to accept a change to registry when a new program try to make an automatic change. It drove me nuts until I found the right combination to stop the low risk changes from popping up every minute.On the good side it upgrades virus database often -- certainly dail;y sometimes more. It is a good choice for anyone running XP. Don't know how vista will work with it.
62623,1,"I don't have this version of the software, but the previous version can really teach you to read and write kana. I have tried a lot of language software and books that did not work for me. If you follow this program, you will be able to read and write the Japanese phonetic language. It won't give you a lot of vocabulary, but you will be able to sound out Katakana and Hirgana. You also won't be able to actually read Japanese since many chinese characters (Kanji)are also used in written Japanese, but it is agreat start."

13180,1,"How quickly people forget the pain of managing RAW images with just the operating system and a copy of Photoshop. Thanks to Aperture (and its subsequent imitators) managing (and interacting with) huge RAW libraries becomes invisible and easy.I specifically like the full-screen mode, which puts the images front and center. Likewise, the Loupe tool lets you check focus on an image without taking the focus (no pun intended) away from the photography. And you can make changes to the images without having to convert them, then edit them, then hit Save-As everytime you have a new idea. Aperture is completely non-destructive. The RAW image is loaded and adjustments to it are tracked seperately (yet seamlessly) so that you never have to worry about losing your master.There's a lot more in the app beyond these things, which is what makes it such an amazing piece of software. Its a digital SLR's best friend."
36559,1,"This is a very good game. My boys are just turned five and seven. They both can play it, as they have appropriate content for both of them. The best part is that they can pretty much play it all by themselves. It's easy to navigate. I have some other games that are hard to navigate, and I have to sit there the whole time and assist. My eldest was really having issues with enjoyment of math. He can do it just fine, but was beginning to convince himself that he was terrible at it, and that it was awful. This has helped him immensly he has a renewed enthusiam and thinks it's really fun. I have positve feelings toward scholastic products. I have been really pleased with most things I have purchased from them and this is obviously no exception"
14865,1,"The amount of off the wall choices this game gives you is very nice. The amount of customization is astounding. The custom stalls and signs is a very nice touch. The scenarios are nice, more then Soaked but still not enough. Sandbox mode is still very fun. Overall, this game is a good buy for the price and is the best Tycoon game out there."
70537,1,"Norton 360 for 3 PCs is a good value. I never liked having to pay for my annual Norton subscription, but at this price, this version of Norton's protection software is worth the price. Along with the ""basics"", virus protection, spam protection, etc., it combines a lot of features I used to buy, install or execute separately- disk defragmentation, file backup, temporary file clean-up. Having two gigs of free online storage available is a nice feature (but most users will probably need more).The software was easy to install and set-up- maybe even a little too easy. It makes a lot of assumptions and uses a lot of defaults, so tweaking settings can be a challenge.I'm not enamored of the change in interface (I upgraded from Norton's Internet Security), but for most users the simple, almost stark appearance probably makes a lot of sense.Despite the peculiar misgivings I mentioned, I highly recommend Norton 360 for 3 PCs."
54192,2,"There are too many kinks in this program to work out. The layout is great, but execution is poorly done. As soon as this was installed on my computer, it crashed. We had to wipe the entire drive because of this. I haven't tested the DVD builder, but as for creating VCDs, it makes it difficult. There were so many problems with this software, that I can't even START going into it. For more information on these problems, though, go to www.roxio.com and read their their online support FAQs. Too bad I didn't think of doing that before I bought the software."

We just got Dig 'n Rigs the other day and I'd have to say that this toy is an order of magnitude better than the others. The user interface is excellent - everything is in 3D, yet it's easy to navigate. It allows kids to actually drive the trucks from the truck lot to various construction sites, then operate the fairly realistic controls. The game has more degrees of freedom than Tonka Workshop. My son (not quite 3 years old yet) would easily sit at the computer and play this game for hours if I let him."

9800,1,"This action/martial arts film should also be listed under comedy.It is loaded with tons of sarcastic remarks, many of which Christopher Lambert adds in.The whole movie plot is basically about a handful of people in training to save the world from a psychopathic, power-hungry emperor. The group of people includes the characters of g-man wannabe Sonya Blade, martial arts actor Johnny Cage, and Liu Kang, a former member of the Order Of Light Temple, or something like that.These people are on the skeptical side and these are the reasons why: Sonya is out for revenge, Johnny is on an ego trip, and Liu thinks fighting in a tournament for the fate of the world is nonsense, and he only wants to fight so he can find his brother's killer.As I said before, the cheesey lines are what's best about the movie, unless you happen to be a fan of Christopher Lambert, then that's the other main reason to watch Mortal Kombat.although not always true if you watch a movie with cheesey lines and at least one good looking actor it should be good.how ever it is NOT always the case."
67440,1,"I used the Garmin MicroSD Data Card in my Garmin GPSMAP 60Cx on a two week hunting trip in Montana in November,2008. Performance was excellent after I called Garmin tech support to find out how to view the topo data (that would be drill down in scale until the GPS will display topo data).The chips are pricey. I would have used a data CD but Garmin is not Macintosh friendly, so I needed to buy the chips for my hunt.The chips are not marked as to data content, so I used a small ziploc bag to hold the data chip and a note on the contents. Otherwise your option is to install the chip in the GPS and then view the title."
9322,2,"I have been attempting since November 18th to recover from my installation of NSW 2004 and Norton Firewall 2004. I have been using Norton Utilities/suites since about 1985, but never again. I had a perfectly good installation of NSW and Firewall 2001, but thought it was about time for me to upgrade. Looks like I should have sought out some of the early reviews; I would never have changed. In any case, after nearly a week of fixing things, I am at least back to where the computer no longer gives me frequent blue screen crashes, freezes, slow/no shutdown, etc. Also, even after a good shutdown, I often got an incomplete Windows ME load, and would have to do a power switch shutdown and recover. Norton GOBack was installed, and later removed, as whenever Disk Doctor or Speed Disk are run, Norton recommends disabling GoBack, which clears the restore history files. Of what use is this program? NSW is also a resource hog. I have 512MB of RAM, and the installation took me down to 47% resources free. I have had to trim out the startup files to get up to about 78% free, and, when later running Norton programs, there is a lot of memory leakage that lowers the free resources. My other applications seemed to work about as fast as usual, but Norton programs themselves seemed quite slow. This has been a big disappointment. I am not sure I have fixed this thing yet, but I have had two successful restarts without fatal exception errors on startup. I seem to recall in the Symantec EULA it said that if the user was dis-satisfied with the product they could get a refund within 60 days of purchase. I am going to check this out, and if problems continue, uninstall the product and request a refund. My recommendation: if you are satisfied with your current utilities, anti-virus, and firewall programs, keep them updated and forget about Norton SystemWorks 2004."
32510,0,A lot of money to pay for a small amount of 3D content making it less worthy of the price. Sure there was content but apart from a few scenes the content in 3D did not matter much. Interesting topic but a bit dated for 2012.

83194,1,"This new version of office has it all. Finally all the promise that we had heard was coming is here. In general all the apps are much improved. My only negative is that outlook takes a long time to start up and needs lots of memory. If you can deal with that, this is a huge improvement over previous versions.Right out of the box you are going to have to get used to the ribbon interface but once you get it down, it is much quicker than the old way.Most of the naysayers here are anti microsoft anyway so pay them no mind. If I worked at Sun or Apple I would probably badmouth microsoft all the time too. But I do not and I don't work for Microsoft, so I just use the software, and this was a great upgrade.The best part of it was the publisher upgrade which is a huge improvement over the last version of publisher. I use it all the time for making flyers, postcards, invitations etc.Excel, Word and all the others have been commented on by tons of people, but almost noone talks about Publisher. In this version it really is a competitive piece of software to the basic and even some of the advanced Adobe tools. If you could edit PDFs natively that would be great, but because ADOBE is a monopoly, you are stuck overpaying them to edit pdfs. Anyway, you can create pdf files in publisher and save them, which is all anyone really needs."
46846,1,"Quickeys 3 by Startly Technologies is a powerful utility to help the computer user create an endless variety of shortcuts that automate everyday, repetitive tasks, resulting in increased productivity.Quickeys can:* Launch and manage files, folders, servers and applications (ex. launch your documents folder, switch hard drives, copy or move a file automatically to another location for quick on-the-fly backups)* Launch web addresses and automatically enter passwords (ex. Check e-mail accounts, review bank statements, pay bills online)* Write automatic e-mails, documents and any other application requiring text entries (ex. Send an automatic reply to an e-mail, write an invoice,, automatically write your grocery list each month)* Calculate formulas and mathematical data* Select menu items including context-sensitive items* Select items based on single, double, triple and right mouse clicks* Launch apple script and UNIX commands* Combine shortcuts you have created into single click power shortcuts.Quickeys builds these shortcuts into the system interface and allows the user to:* Create hot keys and key combinations to launch shortcuts* Select shortcuts from a drop down menu on the menu bar* Enable shortcuts by speech commands* Launch shortcuts from the finder or only in specified applications (scope)* Launch shortcuts based on a specified day or time* Map any function or application to a key, dater, time or device.The program does for the Operating System what the actions palette can do to automate steps in Photoshop.Installing the program was as easy as dragging the icon into the Applications folder and launching the program. Quickeys comes with an indispensable 216 page user guide which requires some careful study before mastering the program, but if you give it some time at the beginning it will be worth your while. And if you are truly stuck, Startly Technologies offers a variety of support options including phone numbers, e-mail addresses and best of all, an online forum called ""Quickeys Community"" which is compromised of Quickeys users throughout the world. Best of all a link to the Community is built right into the Quickeys interface.The Quickeys 3 interface operates similarly to that of the finder. Customizable icons are available on a special menu to help the user become comfortable with the variety of tasks.I began the Quickeys learning process by creating a list of desired shortcuts I wanted to have automated and then approached the software to determine if they could be done. The first item I selected was to create a single shortcut that would launch Entourage, check for new e-mail, apply rules and spam filters, and move unwanted e-mail to the trash. I also wanted QuicKeys to log into my instant messaging accounts, and go online to check my bank balance... all with a simple one-time keyboard combination.This is where I really became impressed with Quickeys. Not only did Quickeys launch Entourage, but the built-in added options of selecting drop down menu items allowed QuicKeys to retrieve new mail, apply the filters and dump my spam into the trash.Quickeys also launched Yahoo Instant Messenger, logged into my account and hit the ok button and in a flash I was chatting with mom in Texas.Finally Quickeys launched my Internet browser, typed in the address for my bank institution, added my user name and password in the proper fields and logged me into my bank account.I was able to combine all three of these shortcuts together into a final single masterstroke. So now when I wake up in the morning, I hit a single key on my keyboard and have my morning coffee while Quickeys performs my morning computer ritual for me... and mom waits for me to wash the dishes and get back to my computer.As I began to write this review I had noted that the more shortcuts I created the greater the number of keystrokes - and resulting key combinations - I had to memorize. I was going to suggest that the software developers create a way to have the list of shortcuts available in a drop down menu on the Finder's menu bar. But last night as I was digging deeper into this program, I discovered exactly that feature. You beat me to the punch guys.Quickeys requiresMac OS X v10.3 or later128 MB RAM20 MB of free disk spaceCertain features require an Internet connection"
53278,0,"It is very annoying when you make a wrong turn. It will just keep repeating ""off route"". It does not recalculate unless you force it to.Because of danger of theft, you have to hide the laptop computer every time that you stop. There are a few too many cords with laptop charger and GPS sensor cords strung around the car.I like the built in options for distance, mileage, nearby attractions and large screen. I will use the vehicles built in navigation to get me to my distination, but I will use Streets and Trips to locate any nearby attractions. It is nice to be able to plan my trip on my home computer and then transfer the information to the laptop for travel.It does have a lot of roads that are not on most other GPS guides. I like the simplicity of choosing a route and being able to send that route to other people over the internet. It does give GPS coordinates and elevation. If you are a tech oriented person then this might be for you. If you like hands free, then a voice operated system is probably a better choice. This is an inexpensive alternative to the expensive navigation systems if you have a laptop computer."

QCM helps me a lot with an easy to use contact manager, and I love that I can sync it to Quickbooks.I also have an online store, hosted by Yahoo!, and Yahoo! store manager has a neat quickbooks export option. Using that with QCM as well was very helpful in maintaining my customer base.If you have a small business and need an easy to use yet feature filled contact manager and customer record database that also works well with quickbooks, then Quickbooks Customer Manager is a very good choice."

After wasting a lot of installation time (including the time to call the Roxio technical support that ASKS for money to offer help), I learned that the main CD was missing. But that's as far as the technical people went. They asked that I contact customer service to ask for the main CD to be sent to me.Customer service was absolutely awful. Sent them an email. They responded after exactly one week with a generic, non-intelligent response, that included a bunch of URLs and a suggestion to contact the technical support.Wrote back to the customer service and explained again on Dec. 16, 2004. They responded back on January 5, 2005 (that's three weeks later), with even a more un-intelligent response.Avoid Roxio. Save yourself time and efforts. Be aware that their customer service is absolutely poor and that their technical support will asked for money to help you."
60624,1,"I own almost every scrapbook software program out there and this is by far my favorite. I wanted something that had cool pre-made pages that I could just drop my digital photos into. This program has the most beautiful pre-designed pages that are all ready for you to personalize with your own titles and text! You could literally have a gorgeous completed scrapbook page in a matter of minutes. In addition, you can create incredible pages from scratch if you choose to, with all the great artwork and options contained in this program.It has such great features -- you can even change the colors of the clipart to fit a certain color scheme you have in mind. That's a real rarity in scrapbooking programs that have pre-made template pages. It also has the greatest paper doll cutouts that you can use on your pages. You can create darling paper doll duplicates of any individual -- match their hair, eye and skin color, dress them up in the same clothes that are in the photos, give them things to hold that go along with the theme of the page, etc.I can't say enough good things about this software. If you are a novice, you will want to actually READ the manual or at least go through the on-screen tutorials. If you've used similiar programs before, you'll probably be able to just install and start designing.I did read one helpful hint that I'm very happy I know about on a Sierra help page. It deals with how to insert digital photos into a template. I thought I'd post it here so that someone who gets this great software doesn't get frustrated like some of the people who've posted reviews have gotten.When you want to insert a digital picture into a pre-set frame or object, click inside the white space of the frame so that it selects this area. Right click and choose &quot;Replace Picture&quot; and the Graphics Grabber window opens. In the Graphics Grabber window select the &quot;Import button&quot;. Select an image on your computer and choose the Import button. At this point it adds the image to the Graphics Grabber window. Double click on the image in the Graphics Grabber window, and it will replace the white space with your picture. Resize it if necessary, and you're done in a snap! I think that understanding how to insert pictures correctly was probably the main trouble people were having with using this program.It sounds like this software has been a little hard for some people to figure out, but I thought it was pretty easy. And even if it does seem confusing or something at first, trust me, it's worth the effort to learn how to use it. THIS SCRAPBOOKING SOFTWARE IS THE GREATEST! You will love the pages you can create with it, even if you aren't artistic at all (like I'm not....) Everyone will be so impressed when they see what you've done with your pictures."

53796,0,"Let's face it - there aren't many options available for someone wishing to learn basic Amharic. And after using this product for a while, you'll certainly know more Amharic than you started with. It's a worthwhile purchase as long as you aren't expecting too much out of it.I do think it could be improved, though. In particular I would take issue with some of the choices of vocabulary it teaches - there are words and phrases which would be useful but don't appear, as well as some that just seem unnecessary. This is especially so in the ""phrases"" section, and it isn't helped by the fact that some of these phrases are so long and complicated that the odds of a basic student memorising them seem remote at best.And the customer service is TERRIBLE, so you'd better hope you don't get a defective CD.Until something better comes along though, this will do for the basic traveller."
18298,1,"When you buy a new, high capacity hard drive, it can be a real headache to transfer the data from the old drive to the new one. This software does the job for you.I first tried Drive Copy a couple of years ago after discovering that the &quot;sys&quot; command and the &quot;format \f&quot; commands no longer work under the version of DOS supplied with Windows 98, thus making it impossible for me to write system files to the new hard drive so that it would boot the system. The original Drive Copy not only wrote the system files, it made an error-free copy of everything on the old drive.My only complaint with the original Drive Copy was that it insisted on making the partition size on the new drive the same as on the old drive. Thus if your old drive was a 2 gig. drive and you purchased an 8 gig. drive, you ended up with a 2 gig. active partition and a 6 gig. extended partition. Drive Copy 3.0 has fixed this problem. If you copy from a 12 gig. drive to a 20 gig. drive, you get the whole 20 gig drive as the active partition (if you want it that way).The only reason I gave this software four stars and not five is that I think the instructions could be better. But this software really works, and you can't beat the price."

3548,1,"For my work I have to make a lot of Powerpoint presentations. For editing photos and graphics I've been using several advanced programs. I needed a sound and video editor as welll as new burning software so I bought Roxio EMC8. The photo editor works nearly as well as the advanced software I'm used to using. I haven't had to use another program when I'm editing photos. If you use their photo editor you can go directly to slide show maker or the burning options. Since much of my work is professional, I need to have backups. This suite has an auto backup utility. You can auto schedule backups to your liking. The video editing has been good to. I get requests to put the presentations on discs so they can be mailed or hand carried. I'm able to jump from making the presos to burning disks really quickly. This suite has been a big help in my work creation."

The licensing is good for 2 units, adding a third license is the same price as the original software, which is stupid. I ended up purchasing a second map so I could get 4 licenses for the price of 3. So the map gets 4 stars, but the licensing gets a 2."

Its use is as easy as Encarta's, and you can find everything about movie world (films reviews, biographies...). It is a multimedia product, with photos, music, dialogues, videos... Although it focuses in the USA, it includes international production too.I don't understand why Microsoft stopped publishing it in 1996. I suppose it was &quot;too good&quot; for the market, and that books' merchants thought it was a heavy competitor.I would pay a lot of money very happy if Microsoft produces a new version.Another option would be to integrate it with Encarta, as they did with &quot;Encarta Africana&quot;.

I wasted a whole sheet of photo paper by not feeding it into the printer in the proper direction. Once the sheet was printed, I started making folds in the wrong directions and although it can be undone, save yourself the extra work by making sure you're folding in the right direction before you crease the fold. I was very pleased with the quality of the end result and plan on ordering some more right away. I do have a concern about the pages separating at the perforations over a period of time and possibly this is something that can be improved on."

AppleWorks (as far as I can tell) has all the power of MS Office and is way easier to use.

6543,1,"Before I begin let me just start by congratulating the director on an exceptionally well thought out cast. I mean I liked all the characters in the film and continuity was super. Mark Ruffalo must be having a really good personal life or something because he has come a long way from the man standing in the shadows of a shot -> to a man who can just about carry such a difficult role with such ease.It aches me to see that films like this don't get enough recognition when you compare their success with BLOCKBUSTERS. Anyway, the film has the kind of TITLE which would make me watch it anyway unless it was an animation, then I'd think twice.Mark Ruffalo gets my honors for playing the role of PAUL with remarkable ease and my heart warmed to his character very early in the film .Moving on, Annette Bening - well - where does one begin. She's definitely the star of the film besides the older of the two child actors.Julianne Moore has come along way but age has not taken away from just how contemporary and sexy her look is in some scenes of the film.This film is more than the storyline will throw at you. It talks about loneliness, togetherness, love, lust, sperm donation, questioning your kids sexuality and such random things in life without ever discerning the viewer.I also loved the character names of JONI and LAZER and not to forget JULES.Running with Scissors and The Upside of Anger are EXAMPLES of similar films that tried hard but failed to move me but THE KIDS ARE ALL ALRIGHT is where the FILM-DIRECTOR (if I can put them all in one bracket) gets it right.Anybody who misses the charm of films like LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. STEP MOM or let's say THE SQUID AND THE WHALE will not be disappointed by this film.This is the sort of film HBO will play for the next decade or two.PS - it was good to see an indian kid play a small/ half important role"

74154,1,"I am a PC user, and I was originally upset that older versions of Canvas were Mac only, since it seemed the best software for my work applications.Canvas 9, for PC, was a bit unstable. Yes, it would crash a lot and have difficulty opening some files. I still have it on one of my older computers and frankly it is no longer effective as a program.Canvas X, however, is a gem!! Only on _rare_ occasions does it crash, and I only notice it as occurring when trying to convert an excel graph.As a design program, this is the best!! It has a lot of the functionality of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, but with complete manipulatability. Converting files to other formats is easy (but best conversion compared to other programs to tif files). This program maintains the highest resolution of photographs, better than other programs I've tried.Unfortunately, it is also lacking for conversion to CMYK color formats. If I need that format, I convert with this program to a RGB tif, and then have Adobe Photoshop convert to a CMYK tif.I highly recommend this program if you need such control over graphic files. I don't even know how to do half of its functions (primarily because I don't need to know), but this is such a rich program!"
51884,0,"I purchased this product a few months back, expecting to receive some very cool PowerPoint and Word templates, but was very much disappointed. PowerPoint temps are more for use in creating digital photoalbums, the ones that are dedicated presentation slides are very lame and drab I would certainly stick to the ones in Office. The ones in Word were very disappointing, its like they were trying to turn Word into a desktop publishing programme, its very difficult to navigate in application that was not made for creating postcards. The Outlook stationaries are satisfactory but I do not always use them, Excel is also satisfactory it has templates for creating book list and ""student register"". Overall I would suggest purchasing a third party app with much more pleasing templates than this. I was also expecting templates for MS Access."

All-in-all, diskeeper stands a head over the rest. It is faster, and much more thourough. My windows defrag utility took 2.5 hrs to defrag my drive, after one days use. Diskeeper takes 2 min after a weeks use. I must admit that though diskeeper is fast, it gets slower, and slightly less thourough (though still more so then windows defrag) when the volume is very full. After my computer reached around 90% full, the defrag took around 10 min, and left 2-20 files still fragmented, depending on how often i started using it. Still, it is an excellent program, and worth the price."

46546,1,"National Geographic topo maps are great if your understand their strengths and limitations. First, don't expect to import the actual maps into a GPS receiver. These maps are raster-scanned directly from USGS 7.5' topos; GPS receivers use vector-graphic maps that are only available from your receiver's manufacturer (and they are much less detailed than NG maps). But you should never expect your GPS receiver's display to completely replace a paper map anyway. It's too small to show much detail, and if your receiver fails, you'd be out of luck.Since these are based on USGS maps, they have the same high quality including tons of detail, but since many USGS maps are more than 10 years old, you won't necessarily get up-to-date information. Since topographic features don't ordinarily change as frequently as man-made features, you're usually OK, but keep this in mind.These maps allow you do a lot of other things with your GPS. You can create waypoints on the computer, either by placing a marker on the map or by entering in the latitudes and longitudes of your points, then transfer them to the GPS. This is much easier than manually entering the info through your GPS user interface. You can also download tracks from your GPS receiver onto the map to see where you've been. And you can draw intended journeys directly on the map screen, then measure the distance and elevation profile of the route. The elevation profile is a bit noisy, but you get a pretty good idea of how much elevation change you'll experience on a hike. The tool you use to draw the route on the screen could benefit from an improved user interface, but with a little practice you can get pretty good at it. If you make a mistake, hold down the right mouse button to erase the error. One thing I like is that you can print out a custom paper map, and if you print using your inkjet on NG's waterproof paper, you can get a custom color map that really is waterproof.The major limitation at this point is that the software is not fully compatible with some of the newest GPS receivers. I can't use the USB cable with my Garmin GPSMap 60CS, but it works pretty well with the Serial cable, other than garbling waypoint names. Hopefully this will be fixed soon."
5310,0,"OK. I do not own the software and am pretty excited about it even after I read some of the reviews. There is no place to put up this questions and am certainly not going to refer to the scansoft site. So, I thought I could post it up here and see if anybody who owns this can turn this into a different review:Here are my needs, see if this program will match them:I work at a publishing house in Mexico and often proof-read the English translation to see if it matches the Spanish, the text works for the printig version etc. In a few words, I read the English to see if it is well written, says the same as in the Spanish version and looks good on the pages with images etc.I would use this program for:1. Use the read-out-loud so i can listen to the Spanish while reading the English on paper. (both on PDF format)2. Read-out-loud the English to catch mistakes.3. Mark, correct, comment on top of the PDF file so i can send it straight back to the translator/designer/book coordinator.If this program can do this much I think it would be a big help for publishers... specially abroad. One concern I have is that the PDF files usually have a lot of images and notes on the images. How would the read-out-loud feature read them in order?"

17918,0,"Despite my love for the first three Harry Potter games, I held off for years before buying Goblet of Fire because of all the bad reviews this game received. It was obvious that this installment in the HP game franchise was a radical departure from the others in the series, and all of the criticisms of the player control system in particular convinced me to wait until I could pick up the game for as low a price as possible. Now, having finally played the game, I have to say that it isn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be. Certainly, the keyboard-only control system is awkward and takes some getting used to, but it certainly isn't impossible to make your character do what you want him or her to do. The graphics are also quite good - except for several cut scenes which feature pictures with no animation - and the game can be challenging in a few different spots. Still, there is no question that Goblet of Fire fails to deliver a true Harry Potter experience, and the trouble begins with the very concept of the game.One of the best things about the earlier Harry Potter games was the ability to explore Hogwarts on one's own. This is totally lacking in Goblet of Fire. Forget finding secret areas filled with bonus goodies; in this game, you're barely even allowed inside Hogwarts proper at all. There is absolutely no interaction with Hagrid, the professors, or any classmates apart from Ron and Hermione (even Snape and Draco are nowhere to be found), and the only thing resembling a mini-game is a set of laborious challenges courtesy of Mad-Eye Moody (and there's little to no fun to be had in these). The main areas you are given to explore consist of Hogwarts' exterior walls, the Herbology greenhouse and grounds, the Forbidden Forest, and the Prefects' bathroom. Until the end fight with Voldemort, your enemies basically consist of a small selection of annoying magical creatures. There is only the most rudimentary outline of a story, which means you are basically given a series of chores to complete - and the only way to advance to the final levels is to find TriWizard shields scattered among the various levels. When you actually find one of these things, you're immediately taken back to the main menu, which means you have to go back and choose that level again just to continue progressing through it - this is one of the game's most annoying features. Another drawback is the fact that you encounter challenges in the early levels that you cannot attempt until you've learned a certain skill in a later level.You just have to keep plugging away at the same few levels in a frustrating search for TriWizard shields in order to unlock the three TriWizard challenges and the final encounter with Voldemort. The TriWizard events themselves are simplistic and frustratingly mundane, and it doesn't seem to matter very much how long it takes you to complete them. You are only too glad to accept whichever trophy you win and move on because there is no fun to be had in doing these challenges again. Speaking of a lack of incentive, there is basically no point in struggling to stay alive when you're injured. When you die, you simply re-spawn right then and there with full health. Where's the challenge in that?I admit that I did enjoy the game to some degree, despite many of its frustrating flaws, but I think that is largely due to my love for the whole Harry Potter story and universe. I have gone through the earlier games on several occasions, but I do not see myself playing this game again anytime soon. It is just too frustrating and repetitive to truly enjoy, and those of us who bring our love of the earlier games with us to Goblet of Fire cannot help but be disappointed by the loss of so many game elements we had come to expect in any Harry Potter game."

After pinnacle released a few patches and instructed me to ""clean my registry"" to update things I got some things working better however nothing works quite as promised. I still have yet to get this to encode things in motion-JPEG format as the package indicated it could!The program let me capture video (after hours of tweaking settings and disabling other programs) at a fairly high data rate (high quality video) however when I went to burn the footage onto DVD, the program would automatically RE-encode everything at a very LOW data rate- resulting in fairly poor quality images. One of the main reasons that I purchased this equipment was to archive home movies in a high quality format. To date I have only been able to archive footage at low quality- even after months of discussion with customer support.I have had better luck using the crippled Ulead utility that came bundled with my DVD-burner that using this.Save your money to buy something else."

Alteast it allows manual entries, which is how I finalized my return. The software also has several disclaimers (on Schedules A &amp; D) that they are not finalized.

I just placed my order for the program. I haven't used enough of the other features to give it 5 stars, but it's worth the upgrade."
48337,1,"My son (6 yrs old) enjoys the Magic School Bus videos and books, so I figured he would like this too...He LOVES it. He's had it for a year and still enjoys it. We have added three additional titles and he loves them too. My husband is a computer instructional designer and is always frustrated with poor quality software for kids, but this is well written and thought out software that even he approves of!I would recommend any of these titles you think your kid would enjoy!"
73052,0,"After discussing some of the computer issues I was having on my home pc at work, a co-worker recommended SpySweeper. She had told me she had had success with the software and it sounded great. I then went to a local computer store and asked for further opinions. Again I was directed to SpySweeper. So I thought, what the heck, three people can't be wrong. Sigh.The software was ridiculously easy to install and I ran into zero problems doing my first ""sweep"". It seemed to be working wonderfully and I noticed numerous pesky adware names being removed. I rebooted my computer, jumped online, and, woo-hoo!, there were no pop-ups and the internet didn't crash once. The next day was a different story entirely.The next morning brought fewer pop-ups, but pop-ups nonetheless. And then the internet started to crash again. Aside from those issues--which I should no longer have been having--SpySweeper became annoying in and of itself. It swept at the drop of the hat. Even though I altered the schedule and options. And there were some spyware and adware that it just wouldn't get rid of.Overall, I was initially pleased with the software, but that has certainly waned. Now I have to go back out and find something else to help with this problem. If I could return SpySweeper I think I would be tempted to do so."
71988,2,"Microsoft has really screwed up with this 2003 edition of Streets and Trips...!!! All of the map information is OLD and OUTDATED. I've been a loyal customer of Streets and Trips since the 1998 version and this is the worst one by far. In Elizabethtown, KY, you'll find streets missing (Strawberry Alley), airports in the wrong place (Addington Field), cities in the wrong place (Fort Knox, KY), roads mis-named (highway 62 west), outdated airports (KSDF -- Louisville, KY) and the problems go on and on here in this one little county in Kentucky. This is a horrible effort littered with outrageous flaws over previous versions of this program. DON'T Buy IT!"
88027,1,Is it possible to wear out a softwear program?! My 5 year old has been playing this game for over a year and between this and Search &amp; Rescue he never wants to play anything else! He finds it incredibly rewarding - worthy of a good belly-laugh - when he can print out his works of art and certificates! We definately got our money's worth!
7774,1,"I have this game and at first, I only got to $100 or $200 but now I can reach like $8000 or even more! It is really really challenging sometimes. Sometimes it is scary when you answer a question that you are 99.9% sure is correct and you wait and wait and you find out it's wrong. I also don't like when they say you are a ""cheater""."

25546,1,"I wrote earlier of the problems I was having with Norton Antivirus 2003 and I was having a lot of problems all associated with Norton. I noticed as I read other reviews no one said anything they did to solve their problem. So this is what I did &amp; hope it will help someone else. First, I reformatted my hard drive, then upgraded from Windows 98 to Windows 2000 professional. Next I got DSL, my son's suggestion. Guess what?? I am having no more problems. Have my fingers crossed &amp; am back on my computer."
14382,1,"I've been using Money 2002 since it came with my laptop. I decided to upgrade to Quicken 2006 Premier and it's awesome. In typical microsoft fashion, I found Money to be quirky, hard to navigate and the general interface to be not pleasing.I have seen some people post complaints about switching from Money to Quicken, but I had no problems and switched 2 checking accounts, a savings account and a retirement account in 15 minutes. The only reason for me to keep money is for a record of old transactions.As good as this program is, don't pay $80. Google it and you can find it for less than $40; less than $30 if you do a little research."
31833,1,"I'm not a kid but in my mid 50's, and I love this game! It tests my visual perception, vocabulary and ability to foresee what moves are necessary to align higher-scoring words. The fact that words can be spelled out forward (left to right and up and down), backward (right to left and upward) as well as in a spiral, diagonally or in a serpentine manner makes it more fun and challenging. The extra points tiles and the burning tiles, desending to threaten burning down the ""library"" add to the excitement."

32582,1,Very prompt fast service. I have used this product for years. The instructions are user friendly. So pleased to be able to replace one that got broken.
58748,1,This product really makes my life easier. I think it's worth the price for the time I save. I also like the It's deductible segment for charitable donations. I've used Turbotax for many years now and would highly recommend this product. It really makes filing taxes a lot easier.And I like how it pulls your personal information fromt the year before so there is less chance for errors.

The program works well but I'll never buy anything from McAfee again."
54500,1,"TOPO 2008 has some good points: it's half the price of most of Garmin's other cartography products, and it doesn't require an unlock code. Read some of the reviews on Garmin's ""City Navigator North America"" product - there are some real horror stories about the problems people have had with Garmin's unlock code system.NOTE: In specific discussion of how TOPO 2008 interfaces with a GPS, the unit used in this review is a Garmin 60CX.What you get with TOPO USA 2008 that's good:1. It adds a lot of city streets and county roads that are not included in the base map. However, the positional accuracy of these roads is often pretty bad. But at least having them would probably help you find an address if you got lost in an unfamiliar neighborhood or rural area. Unfortunately though, the road network in TOPO 2008 IS NOT AUTO-ROUTEABLE. In other words, if you try to generate a point-to-point trip route in either MapSource or in the GPS itself, the route will not follow the roads or calculate turns. It will just make a strait line (actually a Great Circle curve) from Point ""A"" to Point ""B"". This doesn't prevent you from generating your own routes manually, of course. I guess the lack of auto-route capability is why TOPO 2008 is half the price of City Navigator.2. Since TOPO 2008 contains a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the coverage area, it allows you to generate a profile of your hiking/biking trail or road trip route. This profile capability is very nice when comparing alternate routes, and the profiles can be generated and viewed in the GPS or on the PC in MapSource3. The outlines of many coastlines, lakes, and rivers in the basemap are very coarse and downright inaccurate - TOPO 2006 offers a huge improvement to these outlines (but does not include water depth).4. TOPO 2008 includes thousands of searchable place names and POI's that are not in the base map.What's not so good in TOPO 2008:1. The coverage area is ONLY the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii). Unfortunately, there is no coverage in Canada or Mexico, other than large cities and major highways that are already in the basemap. If you need coverage of our neighbor to the north, the TOPO Canada DVD is pretty expensive at $110, almost double the price of the USA version.2. The contour interval is 1:100,000, which is probably fine for planning an automobile trip, but is very coarse if you are doing a hiking or bicycle trip. Garmin does offer 1:24,000 cartography, but it's expensive and covers only a limited set of National Parks. If TOPO 2008 were to cover the whole USA at 1:24,000, the amount of data would probably require many DVD's instead of only 1, and the retail price would no doubt be a lot more, so I guess the 1:100,000 scale is adequate for most users, and certainly more economical.If you already own the City Navigator cartography, TOPO 2008 might be a nice addition to your chartplotter-capable Garmin GPS, especially if it can display route profiles like the 60CX. However, if your primary need is for automobile routing, and especially if you need coverage in Canada, and if you have a limited budget, you would be better off buying City Navigator if you don't already own it. It's twice the price of TOPO 2008, but has a lot more capability.NOTE: For some reason, TOPO 2008 includes Alaska's Dalton Highway, from Fairbanks to Deadhorse (Prudhoe Bay), yet City Navigator, which costs twice as much and is supposed to offer coverage of all of the USA and Canada, does not.SUMMARY: A good value at $59.10 if you just want to upgrade your GPS's background map, and if you don't require Canadian coverage. Also a nice add-on if you already have City Navigator, as it allows you to compute road profiles anywhere in the USA (including Alaska and Hawaii). City Navigator does not have a terrain model built in, so it can not show profiles on it's own. For owners of large RV's or people who tow large boat or livestock trailers over long distances, TOPO 2008's road profile capabilities could be a really nice trip planning tool."
87509,1,I have a mac g4 with an older operating system. I needed something to defragment my system because I lost my original Norton systemworks. Good thing I found it here & it worked just fine. Now my computer is running better than ever.
45971,1,"This product contains everything a normal corporate or home user would ever need. That does not mean it has everything MS does, but the few things it does not have would only affect maybe 5% of the users. We have been testing the beta verion in our corporate network. Our users (8 with minimal computer skills in the testing group), have made the switch from MS Office to StarOffice with a minimum of difficulty. We have only had problems with the conversion of 2 spreadsheets that had macros, but have worked the problems out. Reading and writing of MS office files - fantastic!! The test group had no problems working with the rest of our corporate computer users who used MS Office. We are now planning to move to StarOffice for out corporate standard. Removing MS Office.By the way doesn't anyone find if funny how you can by a 2.0 Ghtz system for under [price] with everything. But to buy MS XP Professional OS is [price]and MS Office Standard for [price]. Microsoft charges for software almost equals the value of the system. All costs go down in a competitive arena, but where there is a monopoly the prices seem to keep going up. (prices stated here for MS products obtained from Amazon.com after special offers). Go back and look at the software versus hardware costs and how the software costs have kept going up as Microsoft has ...............- My compliments to SUN for such a good product!!!!!"
16643,1,"Ok, right off the bat here, I have had virtually no problems whatsoever with the 2007 PC-Cillin program and have been running it for almost two months now (our 2006 version expired end of July). I have a Dell XPS running Windows XP Media Center with 2 gigs of ram.The only issue I had in loading the program was with my Ad-Aware SE program. PC-Cillin advised me it had to uninstall it before proceeding. No problem for me since I simply reinstalled it later. I also have Spybot Search & Destroy and there was no problem with that one.Once installed, it brings you up to date with the latest updates, a process that only takes a couple of minutes or so.Once installed, I have had no problems with RAM or anything else other than when 'Cillin is performing a scan, the systems slows down just a little. But like before, you can specify when you want scanning done so that it won't interfere with you when you are most active.The frequency of updating daily seems about the same as the 2006 version, like three, maybe four times a day.What really impresses me with this version is, it is VERY pro-active in identifying potential spyware problems unlike 2006. For example, if you are about to visit a ""suspect"" site, PC-Cillin advises you via red-banner warning screens of the specific spyware located there and warns you to go no further. Sorta scares hell out of you when you see them flash onto the lower right portion of your monitor! You can make your own determination if those are nefarious or not and either proceed or back out. These screens are actually small windows that you can close by clicking on the ""X"".On one occasion the program identified two pieces of spyware which had gotten into my system, specified their names and locations and asked what I wanted to do with them. This is a feature also not available in the 2006 version.In terms of catching viruses, this program seems to be every bit as proactive as before, particularly with Trojans and Bytever versions, by catching them and quarantining them immediately.But if this program has a weakness it is still with spyware. One program still doesn't do everything. That's why I have Spybot Search and Destroy and Ad-Aware Se. Spybot is by far the best of the two and will identify specifically up to forty or pieces of spyware. I use Ad-Aware as secondary. These, of course, are free and there are other, better fee-based programs out there as well.Ok, who knows how effective any program really is since you can't see everything going on in your system. But what I can tell you is my computer performs flawlessly with no glitches or hangups whether I am on the net, or playing one of the new high capacity computer games. I don't use Windows Explorer for the net but Firefox instead and always ensure that my firewalls are turned on and auto-updates are working.My wife and I both use this program and are quite pleased. The wife uses it for her lap top. Never before have I felt this confident about exploring the net without fear of my computer being trashed by some scumbag's virus. And with an in-store rebate, we're getting this program basically for free!"

82060,1,"I began with eMedia's beginner CD-ROM and next moved to the Rock Guitar. One of the things I enjoyed most about the former was that it taught lessons with entire songs. However, in Rock Guitar, you only learn bits and pieces of songs--and fewer ones at that. Many are not titled songs, but something like ""a Nirvana-like song."" So if you loved the amount of music on the beginner CD, you may be a little dissatisfied. Additionally, some chords are taught with different fingering than in the beginner CD.All in all, I learn very quickly with emedia. I really enjoy playing along to their riffs and pieces of songs. Putting the voice to the songs to play with is probably my favorite feature (don't tell anybody that I sing along while playing in the privacy of my room).This is certainly a really great step towards learning the basics of rock guitar, but should not be your first eMedia CD-ROM (buy the beginner one first!)."

35161,0,"I bought this product for the huge collection of clip-art, photographs, and fonts. Then I opened the box to find a fraction of what I was promised. It wasn't long before I realized that no, I was not missing any discs, and I was not happy to say the least. Instead of a vast library to install on my hard drive, I was directed to the website clipart.com where I could download what I needed.The box mentions that instead of giving you a lot of discs you can download images from the Internet, and an Internet connection is listed as a system requirement, but there is no clear indication of the fact that this box contains only a portion of the promised 2.5 million images. This is misleading to say the least, and as I said, I was not happy.But once I got past the initial outrage (and once you realize that no, you are not missing any discs), I realized that this product comes with a whopping FULL YEAR subscription to the website--a $100 value--for the mere $30 I paid. THIS IS A TERRIFIC VALUE!If only they had been more clear on the box as to what you were buying. Maybe they'll sell more this way, but look at all the dissatisfied customers.Oh, and the image browsing program included with the set...well, I'm sure they spent at least an hour developing it, but if you have Windows XP there is absolutely no reason to install it."
60855,1,"I love this product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it would be nice to have a choice of aquarium backgrounds. To be able to change that once in a while would be nice. Other than that, being able to change the lighting and the fish is great. They look very realistic... almost as good... but in some ways better than a real aquarium. You don't have to worry about cleaning the tank or having the fish die. My granddaughter loves it and wants it to play all of the time. I love having the soothing bubble sound. I had to turn the bubble column off because it didn't pay properly, but once I did that, I still had the sound just not the bubbles. Love it."
65598,1,"Unquestionably the best program. If you like to delve into the details of disk burning and so on then try something else. But if you like the cut and run approach, try this. It takes little effort to burn disks with the program assistants. The same approach is used for the portable player transfers. I plug in the cell phone and the program does the rest. It id's the device and chooses the right digital format. I'm not stressing over choosing the right options and that makes it fun.A word about video transfers. Last year I bought a Dazzle video converter and it came with transfer software. The original software is okay for the transfer but I can do more with the roxio program. I tried putting the converted video onto a disk directly from the vcr. VideoWave, which is also in the suite will allow edits too. However I did find some lag working from the dvd and would only recommend it in a pinch. I ended up transferring to the hard drive and the editing speed was much better. I think I'll get another HD and use the disks for storage and playing on other media players.Simple, useful, comprehensive, and a pleasure to use."

62220,1,"I purchased this software for my niece who is 3 years old. She has never gotten on a computer before trying this software. I am a school teacher and very much into technology. It disappointed me that my niece had no idea of how to use a computer. This is probably because my brother and sister-in-law have zero technological skills aside from using Microsoft Word. So, I reasearched and found this baby and toddler software. I cannot say enough great things about it! I sat with my niece for 10 minutes, showed her how to move the ""hand"" (instead of the usual mouse arrow) around the pictures and games; off she went on her own selecting what she wanted to play. She soon told me that she didn't need my help anymore and that she could do it herself. The first time she used this software she sat at the kitchen table on my laptop for 1 1/2 hours. She was so excited about what she was doing and that she was doing it on her own. She continues to ask me if she can play the computer. She loves it! This game does not require your child to use a mouse to click on any items, they only need to move and place the ""hand"" on the item they are selecting. Once they place a the hand on an item a star appears. If they keep the hand/star on the item 5 dots slowly appear in each corner of the star. When all 5 dots appear the page then changes to whatever the child choose to play. It is that simple. My operating system is Vista and the program works fine. I would definitely purchase this item if you want your child to begin learning how to use a computer and get the hang of manipulating a mouse."
63751,1,"Rather than buy or download, I used the online version. I also did my tax return long-hand (i.e., I did all calculations myself and used the appropriate IRS forms). Both methods showed me getting a return, and the amount was exactly the same using both methods. So, the bottom line is that Turbo Tax appears to be accurate, but I'm not 100% convinced it's any faster. It did catch one error I had made when I entered the wrong year for my son's birth. Had I filed using long-hand, and not caught the error, I'm sure the good old boys in the IRS would have sent it back to me to fix, and my return would have been prolonged."
2457,1,"It is:1) A highly informative survey of many classical QGD lines and historic games.2) A very short overview of non-QGD openings.3) Garry talking casually and 80 mph about the above.4) A big database.5) Crystal clear on Fritz.6) For those who are interested in chess history & getting ""the big picture"" on an important opening.7) Nice to hear how to pronounce all those foreign names.8) Loosely structured around main variations and famous games.It isn't:1) For players looking for a repertoire.2) For beginners (which it might appear to be by the advertising)3) ""Instructional"" in the common meaning of the term.4) Clear enough for me on the DVD player.I really enjoyed the product because I didn't have any real expectations as to exactly what it would be like. I recommend getting Matthew Sadler's book on the Queen's Gambit Declined as well and then sitting down for some serious study! Garry doesn't really talk over your head, he simply covers a lot of ground in 3 hours and this can be overwhelming if you try to take in too much of it at one time."
72012,1,"REALsoftware produces REALbasic 4.5.1. There are two Macintosh versions to choose, the Classic and OSX, but this review will only cover the Classic version. Additionally, there are two editions of REALbasic, the Standard and the Professional.ADVERTISEMENTThe system requirements are a PowerPC or G3 or G4, MacOS 8.1 or later, 6.5 MB of hard drive space, and 4.5 MB RAM. The test system is a PowerPC 8100 with a G3 367 MHz daughter card, 136 MB RAM, several 4-8 GB hard drives, and MacOS 8.1 and 8.6, using Conflict Catcher 8. A 30-day demo is available for download from REALsoftware.The REALbasic DemoThe REALbasic 4.5.1 demo contains the complete program. REALbasic allows programmers to build both Macintosh Classic and OSX programs, as well as PC programs. Programs compiled by the demo will operate for 5 minutes and only for the trial period. In order to continue using REALbasic beyond the 30 days, it is necessary to purchase a license. The Standard and Professional editions each contain the license, an application CD, and printed documentation. Included in the application CD are examples, tutorials, and electronic documentation. The demo can be obtained from the demo website .The demo file is 8.2 MB. Using a 56K modem, the demo downloads in around 30 minutes. After REALbasic downloads just drag it to your applications folder, no extra installation is required. The demo folder contains the REALbasic 4.5.1 Classic program and six folders - IDE Extras, Internet Resources, Plugins, Read Me's, Soundtracks, and Stationary.The IDE Extras folder has sample coding scripts and allows other applications to be added to the REALbasic menus. Weblinks useful to most REALbasic programmers, as well as links to other REALbasic developer sites, are included in the Internet Resources folder. Plugins add new functions to programs and REALbasic allows for this with the Plugins folder - simply install a plugin into the folder and it is installed as REALbasic starts up. Important development files and release notes are available in the Read Me's folder. Finally, the Soundtracks folder contains sound effects for use in REALbasic and the Stationary folder allows programmers to set default settings for projects. Most demo users, however, will not be using any of these folder features at the start.The program started with no difficulties. Conflicts have been non-existent since installing the program on the test system, in either MacOS 8.1 or 8.6. During testing, Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0 was run along with REALbasic to view the many PDF tutorials. On several occasions, Word 98, Netscape 4.74 and Adaptec Toast 4.1.1 have also run without any problems.REALbasic has a toolbar-based interface, like PhotoShop and PageMaker. At start up, several windows appear: the Control Palette, the Project Window and its untitled Window Editor, and the Properties Window. Providing various Button controls, ListBox controls and EditField controls, the Control Palette contains over 30 interface objects. Drag and drop the required interface object to the Window Editor window to place it into the program. The Project Window lists the items in the program, such as menus, the untitled Window Editor, and any other windows that may be added. Each object, including interface objects, has a Properties Window. This window contains a list of properties and values for the currently selected object. When another object is selected, the Properties Window changes to show that objects properties.Build a First ProgramTo build a first, simple program, such as ""Hello World"", start with the start-up windows: Control Icons window, Project window and its untitled Window Editor, and the Properties window. File > Save As the Project window to HelloWorld.rb. Change the untitled Window Editor name to ""Hello World Program"" on the Title field in the Properties window.Drag and drop the PushButton Tool and the EditField Tool to the program window. Edit > Duplicate (Command-D) the PushButton Tool twice, and renamed the buttons ""DisplayHello,"" ""Clear,"" and ""Quit"" in their respective Properties Name field. Rename the EditField Tool ""TextDisplay"" in the Properties Name field. Place the ""TextDisplay"" EditField at the top of the window with the ""Display Hello"" and ""Clear"" buttons on the same line under it and the ""Quit"" button at the bottom.Add the code to the PushButtons and the EditField. From the program window, Option-Tab to get the Code Editor window. From there, click the disclosure triangle to the left of the Controls icon and for each button add code. In the ""Display Hello"" button, placeTextDisplay.Text=""Hello World""in the Action item. The ""Clear"" button hasTextDisplay.Text=""""and the ""Exit"" button hasBeep Quitadded to the Action item. Choose Debug > Run (Command-R) to test the program.Build the stand-alone applications by going to File > Build Settings. Choose whether to build a Macintosh program or a PC program or both. Name the program ""Hello"" for Macintosh and/or ""Hello.exe"" for PC (using the pop-up menu). Click OK and File > Build Application. REALbasic then builds the application(s). In all, the program should take about 15-20 minutes to build.Additional TutorialsREALsoftware also has several REALbasic Tutorial PDFs on their tutorial website . The main tutorial is 4.5 MB and involves building a simple Text Editor program, similar to SimpleText. In 12 separate chapters it covers such topics as Working with Documents (Ch. 4), Adding Drag and Drop to TextEditor (Ch. 6), and Printing Styled Text (Ch. 9). Each chapter is short and specific, explaining the steps necessary to build a workable program.The Text Editor program is easy to build and will take several sessions with REALbasic. In order to get more experience in specific parts of program building, a new REALbasic programmer should refer back to the Text Editor program because it contains elements required in more advanced programs.Other tutorial programs available include building an URL manager. There are also many websites that contain step-by-step REALbasic programming tutorials. REALbasic University is an excellent resource for the novice programmer, with 73 lessons at last count.ConclusionThis is a very impressive program. The user-interface is excellent and the features are helpful. The possibility to build new programs for both Macintosh and PC is of great benefit. The demo was used on the test system for the full trial period, with at least one hour per day using the program. Many of the tutorials were used during that time to explore the program. While the learning curve can be steep for some new programming languages, the author found that this was not the case. In fact, learning REALbasic was much easier on one's own than his experience learning C in the classroom. The author believes that the novice would have little problem picking up the fundamentals of REALbasic, especially if the many Internet resources are used. While not yet achieving several hundred line programs, beginners can gain confidence as they build more applications, adding new and complex code and features to them."
72604,1,"I am sorry to disagree to what have read in one of the reviews, because as far as I know, ""GOBACK WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REVERT A SYSTEM BEFORE THE DATE FROM WHICH IT WAS INSTALLED"" since the reverting takes place referring the Goback history (I hope the Gobackio.bin), and the history is logged only after Goback's installation. The software is otherwise of a great help as it recovers the files/system at all of the conditions except during mass system activity, which disables logging, resulting clearing of Goback history and putting the system in haywire. Goback is certainly of a great support and it is highly recommended to PC lovers."
64683,1,"My children have loved Pajama Sam for years. They're now 7,8, and 10 and they're still interested in getting the latest versions. Pajama Sam proves that kids can enjoy games without guns and violence. He's cute, he's hip, and he's funny. My favorite thing about this game is that it all takes place inside Pajama Sam's closet, and it's a mess - dirty socks and all."

26514,1,"My son is ten and he says it's challenging. It make you think and has a lot of different challenges. It has several levels. Therefore it does not get boring. It's very similar to the movie but has a lot things that does not have nothing to do with the movie. The game focus on the main idea of the movie. Compared to other games he's played it's longer and challenging. As a parent, I would recommend this to age 7-14."
10097,1,I purchased this software because of a great price and I wished to upgrade from Word 97. It came as expected in great shape and ready to be installed. Works great with Vista and interfaces with all my saved files. Fast delivery and no problems. A great experience
11805,1,Storefront 2000 is an excellent product. I have using it since it was Storefront 99. Works great with FrontPage 2000...all kinds of built in tools for building your own custom ecommerce site from start to finish. I have downloaded and tested at least 20 other &quot;ecommerce/shopping cart&quot; packages...this is by far the best if you like controlling your own design and layout.

7608,0,There is a problem with Quick Time and Microsoft Media Player. As soon as you install the Quick Time it tries to take over all sound formats and does a really bad job of it. If the Quick Time would restrict itself just to the 101 Languge I would love it just fine.
83967,1,"Yes I like the product, but Amazon misleads you about when they can ship it. Said USUALLY ships in 24 hours and I paid more to get 3 to 5 days shipping. Now they email me saying there is a delay (AND YOU CAN'T CANCEL THE ORDER). I ordered on Oct. 17, 2006 and their email now says the new est. date is Oct. 26th through Oct. 29th. AND...what is NOT funny... the web site says if you order it NOW you get free 2nd day delivery. I guess they needed my software to sell to someone else. They are still making me pay for the 3-5 day shipping and the only way I can stop this order is to wait until it arrives and either reject it (won't happen since this is a company) or I'll have to spend my dime, time, and trouble to return it. WATCH OUT about AMAZON misleading you on the availability."

9700,2,"On the reccomendation of a sales person at Stanford Bookstore, I bought MacDrive 7 to help migrate from my old Mac to my new PC.I ran the installer that came in the package and the computer hung up. I re-booted Vista. This time the installer ran and told me that this version does not work with Vista. I called Mediafour customer support and was directed to where I could download MacDrive 7.something that is supposed to work with Vista. I ran that installer. MacDrive then worked long enough to copy all my user files from the Mac to the PC and then stopped working.The worst is that My PC still asks to look for a driver for a device I don't have, the doc, or whatever Micro Soft calls the thing at the bottom of the screen won't hide itself, and my email program can't send email.I could ask for a refund, but that wouldn't fix my email."

Otherwise, the audio in your CD or DVD will be ""staticy"" in places.Other than that, this product is very easy to use! Worth every penny if you want to easily transfer audio tapes to CD or VHS tapes to DVD using ""point and click"" menus."
76899,1,My granddaughter needed some help getting started but soon caught on to the tasks of collecting arrowheads to trade for items needed to free Spirit's friends and to feed Rain. She also loved racing the Eagle which proved to be quite difficult for her. She spent a happy 5 weeks solving the many challenges to free the horses and make the range safe again. My biggest problem was how to get her to stop playing so that she would take time to eat. Her biggest challenge and mine was figuring out how to deliver coal to Harold. Finally I discovered the answer under hints at the back of the instruction book.It may be necessary to set the quality of the graphics down a notch or two on some computers before the program will work. A terrific program.
9803,1,"This fast-paced and very fun video-game-turned-movie directed by Paul Anderson is an exciting film filled with neat-o martial arts and some cool special effects. Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, and Rayden get into combat with Scorpion, Sub Zero, Kano, Goro, and worst of all, Shang Tsung in a tournament that will determine the fate of humanity. Unlike the weak &quot;Street Fighter&quot; movie, this film brings all of the favorite characters from the video game to life with almost flawless accuracy, and with exciting action to boot! Instead of excessive cheesy humor, this film wants to be taken seriously, which is possible, if not hard to do. Probably the film's only flaw is that it's not too original, but it feels fresh, which is a big plus."
33622,1,"This version 3 is not Obsolete, even though version 4 is out.I personally would not pay $1,300.00 for the newer Version 4 Scholars Library Gold, however, I believe around $400.00-$500.00 is a great price for an older Scholars Library Gold Version 3 considering the printed value of all the books is around $14,000.00, and you get the same books as version 4 provides.I have version 3 Scholar's Library Gold and found out verson 4 is a free download from Logos. The version 4 core system upgrade(without books) is a free download from the Logos Website. If your version 3 Logos Libronix Digital Library is installed on your Hard when you download and install Version 4.0 upgrade. The new version 4 will recognize the unlocked licenses for all your books from version 3, and will automatically download the newer version 4 updates of every book from version 3 and install them unlocked on your computer free (no upgrade cost involved).The version 4 free upgrade can also be installed as a stand alone original install, that you can purchase individual books to build your own library. Logos calls it an upgrade, but it is really a full install stand alone, but without any book libraries. The upgrade is a bare bones install.Pros: Full Version 4 upgrade is free.Cons: You do not get CD or DVD for the Upgrades, because they are downloaded from the website, and requires high speed internet and still takes significant time to download. However, once downloaded, you can save all your downloaded books to CD or backup hard drive should you later need to reinstall.You may be able to purchase the upgrades on CD or DVD, like the version 3 used to be able to do. Those version 3 CDs are no longer available, but I suspect the version 4 CD upgrades may be available. You have to check their website to confirm. Since I downloaded my upgrade, I did not look for the CD or DVD upgrade discs.All version 3 books are not compatible with version 4, and will be updated to version 4 books automatically. You can not use the newer version 4 books with version 3 logos. Logos still has all their version 3 books available for ftp download on their website, but newer books will no longer be available for version 3.Weighing the pros and cons, this is a great deal, since you get the same material as the $1,300.00 version 4 material when you consider the upgrade is free.Even so, just because version 4 is out, if your like me, you may prefer the version 3 format over version 4. I really do not like the version 4 format which loses some features, and to me is harder to use. Being used to version 3, I am choosing to revert back to version 3 for now.I have a sufficient version 3 library, do no forsee any need for any newer books that are published in version 4 only format. Should I ever need them, I will later go back to using my version 4 upgrade.Finally, you can have both versions installed together on your PC. The new version 4 upgrade did not overwrite the old. Because I lacked space for version 4, it installed on second hard drive, so now I have both versions and can use either one that I choose to use."
19311,1,"As a homeschooling mom, I love this game. My older son loved the game but aged out of it quickly at almost 6 (but he's very bright). My second son doesn't enjoy video games as much as his brother, but he still prefers the game over bookwork. At 4 1/2, he is improving in most of the areas fairly well. He gets frustrated easily with a few of the games that require more motor skills. I love that there is a skills test that shows his scores in each of the subjects so I know where he needs more work."
15898,1,"This training got me up and running in ONE DAY. I have been struggling to learn Final Cut, and had even taken a class at a local digital media training center here in New York. I had tried a few other self-paced courses as well, both online and CD based. My problem was that I am not the most technical person, and all the other trainings seemed to focus on every single button and option in the software - it was overwhelming. A friend suggested this company, Magnet Media, and said they were really good at teaching you to actually complete a project, rather than trying to teach you every detail about the software you were trying to learn.So at this point I was skeptical about the whole thing, but this training changed everything. They include video files and the (professional editor) trainer shows you how to take the files and create a cool commercial out of them. You have the choice to create a simple, straightforward commercial, or a more advanced one using different techniques. The whole thing took less than a day, and I was able to go back and forth to the specific lessons I wanted to learn or was having a hard time with.That night, I was already applying what I'd learned to the footage I've had sitting here for over a year - now my project is finished!! This training gave me exactly what I needed to FINISH PROJECTS and to be confident that I know what I'm doing. There were some more advanced lessons on the DVD too, and one day soon I'll learn those as well, but for now, I got what I've been looking for. I hear they have other training and tutorials for different digital media applications; I'm glad to have found such a great resource."

69515,1,"How is it that only ""Where in the world"" and ""Where in the USA"" are made to include an XP version, but ""Where in Time"" doesn't? What are we supposed to do? Downgrade? I think that would be completely pointless even if we did so. I recently ordered it, assuming it also was made for XP, but had to send it back. I would like to have ALL three of them. But maybe the company who makes these games should consider making ""Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego"" available for Windows XP. One could change the compatibilty settings, but it would have to be installed first. But then it wouldn't be incompatible if it did."
2764,0,"I've been a Quicken user for more than 12 years and have always been a strong advocate for this software...until the 2007 version. I was quite satisfied with the performance and features of Quicken 2004. The only reason that I upgraded to Quicken 2007 was because Intuit had announced that they would discontinue software updates and downloading of financial info and stock quotes for Quicken 2004 as of 04/01/2007.I've found that Quicken 2007 provides little, if any, improvement in functionality or features compared to Quicken 2004. Furthermore, I've found Quicken 2007 to be quite sluggish when performing certain activities (for example, when reconciling an account or adding the purchase of a stock) compared to Quicken 2004.If it weren't for the discontinuance of updates and downloads for Quicken 2004, I'd switch back to that version and await real improvements in a future version of Quicken."

Maybe not as important as 10.3 to 10.4, where 10.4 was finally a truly stable iteration of OS X, but still an good step. I haven't implemented backups with Time Machine yet, which is a big feature of the upgrade. Otherwise, apps load faster, OS boots faster, shuts down faster. A good upgrade."
13453,1,"We really enjoyed Beyond Atlantis. It's relaxing to play, with beautiful graphics and puzzles that are stimulating, but not so mind-bending that we'd get bored. I enjoyed playing the game as an after-work mental exercise, and our ten-year-old was spot-on with comments, clues and solutions to the puzzles, although he didn't have the patience for some of the map and maze explorations. We ended up playing the game together as a team and had a wonderful time. I highly recommend it for adults who enjoy a little computer fun, but also like to play with their kids."

41515,0,"Having tired of the numerous Windows updates and having adopted Mozilla and OpenOffice as my primary tools, I decided to step into the Linux community. I downloaded two distributions (one was SuSE Personal 9.1) before purchasing the SuSE Professional 9.2 product.I've come away 90% satisfied, but the remaining 10% is keeping me away from a complete migration to Linux. SuSE installed on an old machine (P-III) without issue. The two stumbling blocks I encountered: I never was able to access shared files on other PCs on my home network (the non-SuSE trial package I tried did not have that issue) and Support informed me that several packages (Nvu in particular) are only on DVD format (the package comes with 2 DVDs and 5 CDs). Having only CD units on my PCs, I'm disappointed in the last limitation. It strikes me that I'm about 6-12 months away from being able to have a transparent migration to Linux."

11543,1,"I was able to try the software at a friend's house a few years ago and enjoyed the Petey the Parrot feature that pronounced Latin nomenclature. User friendly. There are good searching and cross-referencing features. The library of species is more extensive than any book I've seen. I like that there is geographic distribution data, population information and song files. It is so much easier to listen to a song file than read ""two wee"" in a field guide and get the same effect of information. This software helps with research presentations. The quizzes are great too. I like that the photos available for each species carry mulitple view whenever possible. I think in the absence of photos, drawings could have been included to cover the gap, especially since females are usually the gap and comprise 50% of the species population, so this is important information. So far that is the only short-coming I have noticed."

It took him a little while to figure out some of the puzzles - it took ME a little while to figure out some of the puzzles - but is very playable and enjoyable. One caveat is there is a middle part of the game where you will play the same puzzles over and over and over again. If your child is easily bored - beware. However, my son doesn't seem to mind this - he just tries to get better and better at each of the little games."

31002,2,Don't buy this product if you plan to create AVCHD disks to play on Blu-Ray players.I bought this product specifically to genereate AVCHD DVD's from my HD camcorder. The AVCHD disks are supposed to play on Blu-Ray disk players. They do not play on my Samsung BD-P1400.

68470,1,"I have used Adobe Photoshop 2 for about 3 years and LOVE the Album portion for organizing and tagging my photos. My photo editing attempts have never been more than cropping & red eye, but I wanted to learn more, so here we go. New laptop & PSE 5. I did have a serious problem when I tried to import the catalog from PS 2. Like the other reviewer, I lost the entire catalog of over 10,000 photos. I was able to recover it from a backup on a hard drive with a LOT of frustration and effort. If you want to try the organization/tagging features and simple editing, download the FREE PS 3.2 version from Adobe. I did this for my mom and it is plenty of features for her purposes. (You do need to register, or it locks up after a month.) Try it, and if you need more, buy this program."

I did purchase the MPEG converter for authoring DVD's. Kinda reverse salesmanship there.My only complaint is that importing tape is limited to large, hard drive consuming files. I want to import as MPEG as some others do. I have two 60 GB HD's on my laptop that works well for 1 movie at a time.

66173,0,"Till recently, words like ""Firewall"" and ""Hackers"" were limited to corporate networks. However, today firewall software for home computers has gained as much importance as the virus protection software and rightly so. With fast, always on internet connections and computers that don't need to be shut down every night, your home pc is an easy target for hackers looking for a host pc to run their web pages or applications, to steal informatin like credit card numbers and address or just to hone their skills. This is why you need the firewall. There is no question about it.The real question to ask is ""Do I need to spend close to 60 bucks to buy ZoneAlarm?""The answer is NO.Firstly, if you are on Windows XP you already have basic firewall protection. Please look at your manual to see how to turn it on. For most users this is enough. If you are really interested in getting more protection, read on.If you have a router to share your internet connection with multiple home machines, then check the router manual. Many have firewall capability which is very powerfull and can protect you from most attacks. This firewall is as good as ZoneAlarm.If you don't have either, you will need something like ZA. But before you rush to order it, I would encourage you to try the free trial version available from www.download.com. At this website, you will also find lot of other firewall programs for free.Finally if you still wanna buy ZA then you should be aware of following problems:1) If you have virus protection software like Norton or McAfee, ZA may actually mess your system up as all these softwares try to grab same files at startup time causing conflicts and system crashes. I had such a hard time that I had to uninstall ZA and clean up my entire system. The problem can be so bad that you may actually not be able to log into your machine at all.2) Poor customer service: ZA doesn't have good, knowledgable customer service. If you run into technical issues, don't expect quick, easy to follow directions to get out of the mess.That said, I still consider ZA to be a good alternative if you do not have Windows' built in firewall or router with firewall capability. However, do try the free version before you buy ZA Pro."

28241,1,"I have been using The Master Genealogist, (which we all call TMG) for over five years. I picked TMG as my genealogy program because it offers me a way to enter every piece of relevant genealogical information, and record the source of that information. It also permits me to keep track of conflicting information, and even information that is known to be in error.The current version of TMG (version 4.0d) takes some getting used to because was written for an older version of Windows. But it is still head and shoulders above the competition. There is a new version on the way. For a preview you might want to check out Family Tree SuperTools.But don't wait! If you are just starting out, or if you are switching from another program, you won't go wrong if you join us satisfied users of TMG.Two of the biggest benefits of buying TMG are that you will find a great group of users in the online TMG mailing list at Rootsweb, and you will find, if you happen to need it, excellent user support from Wholly Genes. Most people never need to contact technical support.My advice to both beginning and experienced genealogists: Buy TMG , subscribe to TMG-L at Rootsweb, and vist Tmgtips on the web.Special note: I also suggest upgrading to the Gold edition. Buy the Silver here at Amazon.com and you can get a downloadable upgrade to Gold from Wholly Genes. It might seem mildly expensive to upgrade, but it's worth it."
88839,1,"In 1985, I didn't have a VCR. I loved ""V"" in 1983 and enjoyed ""V The Final Battle"" in 1984. I was really happy to hear that the struggles of Mike Donovan and the rest of the resistance were coming back as a series. At the time I worked at a local grocery store and, as fate would have it, I was usually scheduled when V the series was on. As a result I only caught a few episodes here and there when I had a day off. It was not as good as the two mini series but I thought it was entertaining. After a mere 19 episodes the show was cancelled and V was gone forever.Since that time, I ran across friends who didn't like the series. Whenever I found articles about ""V"", the series follow up was always dismissed as crass exploitation of the franchise. Last week, WB released the series (possibly to test the wind for a new mini series) on DVD for the first time. Finally, after nearly two decades (can it be that long?) I have been able to finally discover what the series was all about. Here are my impressions:There will be many SPOILERS so please do not read further if you want to be surprised.1. This series isn't bad. It is not as good as the two mini-series but it is entertaing in its own right. I also think that this show was innovative in the field of TV Science Fiction. Prior to ""V"", Science Fiction was very episodic. Star Trek, Space: 1999, Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes, Buck Rogers and to a certain extent, Battlestar Galactica all told self contained stories. The plot was resolved by the end of the hour. ""V"" The series was different in this respect. It had story arcs and continuing plot threads. Every episode ended in a cliff-hanger and it left you wanting more. In this aspect, it has a modern flavor. Like Babylon 5, StarGate SG 1 and Season 3 Enterprise, it tells a big story over a run of several episodes.2. People could die on ""V"". For most TV shows, you know that the heroes will make it in the end. Not on ""V"". Over the 19 episodes, long-standing characters like Dr. Maxwell and Elias Taylor buy the farm surprisingly abruptly. This raised the stakes dramatically and kept the viewer involved in the narrative.3. The cast was great. Marc Singer was perfectly cast as heroic Mike Donovan. Micheal Ironside ruled as perfect tough guy Ham. Jane Badler was very memorable as Uber-B**ch, Diana. June Chadwick was suitably catty as Diana'a rival Lydia. Duncan Rehgar was fantastic as Charles, the leader's envoy. His fight with Donovan in ""The Hero"" is classic. He was a great villain and it is a great shock when he is killed after a mere 4 episodes.4. There is a sense that this is merely a peek at a global war with the Visitors. For the first 12 episodes or so, The Freedom Network newscaster, Howard K. Smith ( A real journalist by the way) reads the headlines on the state of the war. We learn that the Visitors are sweeping through Spain and so forth. This makes us understand that The resistance in LA is only one story in this global conflict. It really gives the story a certain gravitas.5. The stories are often action adventure tales that are on par with anything that was on the air in the mid 1980s. Unfortunately, the sociological aspects that made the first mini series so memorable are ignored completely. The show, evan though it is watered down, is entertaining in its own right.There are some things that are unfortunatle about this show:1. All the SFX are recycled from the two mini series. (I think one new shot was filmed for ""The Dreadknot."") Even entire sequences are lifted from the minis. Remember when Donovan is on horseback and is being chased by a skyfighter? Well, the entire sequesce appears again in ""The Champion."" After a while, it becomes really grating to see the same shots over and over. I know that SFX on TV was really expensive back then but WB should have spent some money on new shots.2. As the series goes on, it is clear that there was less and less money bugeted for each episode. The first episode, ""Liberation Day"" has an outdoor crowd scene with hundreds of extras. By the last episode, we only have the main characters walking around on the standing sets. By the end, the production valules of the show looked rather thread bare.3. The producers decided to exploit the alien lizards by showing them without their Human masks. This was a mistake. The people who created the lizard makeups were not as artful as John Chambers. As a result the lizard appliances were very stiff and immoble. By showing the Lizards in their natural state too often, it undermined their credibility as a frightening threat. The full face lizards were about as scary and convincing as a halloween slip on mask. It became a bit silly.4. I hate cliffhangers that are unresolved. I can't understand why they would create a cliffhanger for a show that was doing poorly in the ratings. It is really unfair to viewers who watched every episode.5. The Star Child. One of the big weaknesses of ""The Final Battle"" was the ending where Elizabeth gets all glowy like Decker in Star Trek the Motion Picture. Elizabeth uses some kind of super powers that come out of nowhere and saves the day. In the series, the Star Child goes through some type of metamorphosis and comes out of a cacoon as a 17 year old love interest. Elizabeth's powers become a crutch that the writers could use to solve any problems that face the main characters. This undermines the drama of the series and cheapens the series. The powers were kind of kooky. The Star Child could levitate objects and people, mimic voices, had a photographic memory, raise the dead etc. She could do whatever the plot required. It was strange that they spent so much time on her character. I guess, as a writer with a deadline, she was really handy to have around.Well, thats my take on the series. I reccomend that if you like V, chances are you will like the series. It is a more cartoony version of Kenneth Johnson's creation but is worthy as entertainment and a nostalgic trip back to the 80s."

This beat them all due to the following features:- Unparalled help - the ""Show me how"" feature is amazing, an interactive tutorial that teaches you how to perform an activity- The prevew video is clear (not choppy), and allows you to accurately view your project- The interface is intuitive - powerful yet still very easy to use once you have passed the small learning curve- Even though the DVD burning software is separate, it presents many of the same benefits (easy to use, professional results, and intuitive- For the price, I would recommend this product over Premiere, Pinnacle, and any other movie editing software product in the $100 rangeJust seems to make sense all the way around."
55886,1,"The 2006 version of QuickBooks is even better than prior years editions. It is much easier for clients to use and learn. It helps them do their bookkeeping and makes it easy for me to support them.The Accountant version lets me access almost all of the 2006 versions of Quickbooks so that I can share data with my clients easily and remotely. There are also big improvements, such as expanded MS Office import/export features, a fast audit trail capability, and a new homepage for users that makes it easy for them to understand what steps to do next in their daily work.I think every accountant should try out the 2006 accountant version. Once you see the 2006 product yourself, you will probably want to recommend one of the other 2006 versions to your clients (such as Pro or Premier)."

74888,1,"This is definitely the product of an older time, when Macromedia QuickTime documents were all the rage, and 640x480 was an acceptable screen resolution, and no one minded the artefacts left in a music or sound file.However, that doesn't remove any of the joy and wonder one gets from wandering the Holy Land, seeing the churches and places Christ would have walked 2000 years ago. True, it looks a lot different from 2000 years ago. But this presentation of the popular landmarks of Jerusalem and the surrounding Israelite countryside is spectacular. Always playing in the background are Christian hymns and songs and probably excerpts of liturgies from around the world including ""Vals del camino"" (a Spanish song), ""Blazhen Muzh"" (A Russian version of Psalm 1), and many others. They're not as pristine and crystal clear as most of us would like, but they are still lovely.Yes, the technology level of this presentation is a bit dated. Yes it's not perfect and pristine like so many of the things we're used to. But it's still amazingly... spiritual.I ran this on an XP; I can't speak for 64-bit machines or anything newer than XP. But if you have any version of QuickTime 5 or above it ought to work just fine."
4071,1,"I became seriously upset reading the 1-star reviews of MAC OS 10.2. What are these people doing? How can they hate it so much? Are they really using the same glorious OS that I now am? In talking to a few people in and around Pittsburgh's design community I've come to a conclusion: these people who hate 10.2 either aren't giving it a chance or aren't letting it work correctly. If you waste your time trying to get it to function just like 9.2.2., then of course it's going to be clunky and awkward--and it will probably crash. If you let it work the way it was designed to--and you just work with it--I swear, it'll be the smoothest, most productive, most enjoyable OS you'll ever touch. This is NOT OS 9.2.2. Forget about it. This is an entirely new--and improved--animal. And I can back this up. I'm not a light weight home-user. I work for a design studio, here in Pittsburgh and run a freelance studio out of my house. I have three MACs, all are now running 10.2, and I have never been happier. My professional applications (Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Flash, InDesign) work flawlessly and intuitively in OS 10.2, printing and scanning are so easy it's ridiculous, my digital camera has no problems with the OS--and my fun applications (iTunes, iPhoto, iChat, iMovie, Mail, the new Sherlock, etc.) really are FUN. Nothing ever goes wrong. Nothing ever freezes or crashes. My music, my pictures, my family and friends, my everything is there for me, all the time. My G4, at home, basically hasn't been shut down since 10.1 came out--and with 10.2, now, my digital lifestyle is even more life-like. This is a brilliant OS--it becomes an extension of your life. It effects the way you live and work and think about things--and it's so simple. Easy. Fast. Beautiful. Smart. Intuitive. Almost perfect. And it never crashes unless you're stupid enough to make it crash--and I suppose that's the reason you'd be trashing it on Amazon with a 1-star review: stupidity. Good work, Apple. Can't wait for 10.3."
28690,1,"First things first... this OS will not run on native 64-bit hardware, unless you can get your hands on one of the third-party ""recompiled"" kernels which can be found on hobbyist sites on occasion. If you have early 64-bit hardware (say, the first 64-bit Athlons) you'll likely be able to make it work, or any 32-bit hardware. Drivers for more modern hardware (video, audio, etc) are occasionally ""fan-created"" and out there, but the base OS will likely not support your hardware today. So, your best bet for playing with this is to revive an old PC sitting in the back of a closet or in your basement or wherever. (You can also run it in a 32-bit virtual machine, by the way, which I'm doing on my i7-based system in my office)The main draw to having this now would likely be to either revive old hardware which can't support modern OS's, or to explore REALLY GOOD OS DESIGN. Yes, the BeOS is still the best example of what I'd consider PROPER operating system design I've ever seen. It was designed from the ground up, in a very logical, very efficient manner.Key to the advantage of this OS is that it's the only ""pure multithreading"" support OS I've ever seen. If you have a windows machine, and occasionally notice that one application will ""take total control"" and will freeze up other applications... this CANNOT HAPPEN on the BeOS. The worst case, if you really overtax your system, is that everything will keep running, but will (proportionally) slow down. Nothing will ever ""hang"" due to not being able to get to system resources.Also key is that this OS is, for all practical purposes, unlimited in terms of the number of CPU cores available to it. Windows artificially limits the available CPU cores, while BeOS will simply farm off threads to any available core or processor, at any time, where they will run with minimal oversight from the operating system. The OS does only what an OS SHOULD do... it plays ""traffic cop"" for the running applications. (Now, imagine a version of this which was recompiled to run on today's multi-core, multichip i7 type processor cores... which would be relatively trivial for a company with the right resources... OS source code, a programming team, and Intel's core command set and timing references.)This is the best ""set"" of stuff you'll find. BeOS r4.5 isn't the final release, but it's the last release which has hardware OpenGL support (Microsoft illegally denied, through a ""filibuster/veto"" action in their role on the OpenGL ARB at the time, BeOS's ability to implement OpenGL for v5.0/v5.1) and works just fine. The BeOS Bible is a great book, and is really crucial (in my view) for getting the most out of the OS, and for understanding how to set it up, and how to really use it.And ""Gobe Productive"" is a terrific office ""suite."" Gobe actually put out a Windows build of this and I use that, fairly often, even today, on my main working machine. It's a low-overhead, fast, totally integrated application which has pretty decent (although now dated) MS Office compatibility. The nice thing is that this is not a series of applications making up a suite, but rather a single program which can handle all varieties of document types - and can integrate elements of them into a single document, pretty much seamlessly, without needing anything like ""OLE"" to accomplish it. You can insert a fully-functional spreadsheet into the middle of a word-processing document, just for example, not as an ""external object"" but as part of the document itself. I LOVE that.I'm still sad that BeOS was beaten down by (illegal, in violation of antitrust laws) actions from Microsoft... but it's a moot point now. Be is long since gone, and their employees are scattered to the winds.But... the FUNDAMENTAL OS DESIGN here is absolutely sound. If someone were to use this same approach, today, but were to write native 64-bit code and provide support for native 64-bit hardware, and modern drivers for modern hardware... AND provide for OpenGL and OpenAL video and audio...... that OS would beat anything else on the market today, in terms of power, efficiency, ease of use, and programming compatibility.The main drawback would remain ""most software is compile to run in Windows, using elements of Windows,"" and those would need to be re-compiled, or a ""Windows virtual machine"" would need to be provided to allow for basic compatibility for the majority of contemporary software. Those programs would run essentially the same in the ""virtual machine"" as they would on native hardware and Windows OS, so there's be no loss, but also no advantage.The advantage, then, would come with running software written to be ""Native"" to this supposed ""BeOS-like OS."" That software would run circles around anything running in Windows.And, I suppose, you could have every ""windows"" application running in its own ""Virtual space"" and thus no ""windows"" application would be able to lock up and interfere with other applications... so that might be an advantage as well.Treat the BeOS as a learning tool today. Learn the architectural approach used by the original team at Be. Learn how they did things, and WHY they did things... and, hopefully, take those lessons into the creation of a new OS.Windows 8 is terrible. It really, really is. I've tested it, and find that while the ""kernal"" level is sound, the user interface is a disaster of the like I've never seen before... making it essentially impossible for me to use a computer the way I want to, and NEED to, for both personal and professional reasons.As a result, I fully expect another renaissance in the ""alternative operating systems"" market soon.Maybe, under another name, the BeOS's concepts may see the light of day again? Maybe it was just way, way ahead of its time!"
16308,0,"As a CM on a project using Visual SourceSafe I speak wth first hand knowledge when I tell you it is very limited. For a small project it is sufficient as long as your manager doesn't start asking for multiple labels, all types of history queries, multiple views, et cetera. Otherwise you will be spending all your time writing scripts to fill in the holes this product leaves. The other annoying problem is documentation. Not only did Microsoft force you to print all the help, very few other publishers have put anything out on it. ""Real World Software Configuration Management"" and a couple others have been helpful, but I put together my own manual and tools from some good info at some Forums.Look hard at RCS or ClearCase before buying this one. We had SourceSafe inhouse so they wanted to use it. I point out the limitations, but I will say it is fairly easy to use and with no more than 4 GB database. It runs relatively error free and is easy to fix with Analyze if you run into problems. Pricewise it is decent, but it lacks the features and support you may find your project wanting. If you have a small database, don't mind writing some scripts, and want to keep cost down, then this may suit your needs."
56285,0,"I have used Paint Shop Pro since it was FreeWare available for Windows 3.1, that's a long time. I have watched this product grow and progress from a simple editor that only handled .gif images (since that was all there was) to what it is today.The people who worked long and hard to build JASC Inc.(the company bought out by Corel), built a solid broduct and a SOLID customer base. It is sad to see Corel abandon all that in order to capitalize on a great product.This latest release of Paint Shop Pro is faintly different then the last. The best improvment is the implementation of the browser interface as a toolbar in the main GUI. Other than that, there are a couple of tweaks here and there, some good like the ""flash fill and background fill"" filters, and some bad like no more Gamma adjustment.If you're new to Paint Shop Pro and want to buy a copy, What the heck, go for it, you won't be disappointed.If you allready have Paint Shop Pro 9, Don't waste you'r money. Wait until they REALLY come out with an innovative upgrade that's worth the money."
61979,1,"I was receiving so much junk mail each day that it was getting to the point that communication through email was getting impossible. Out of 5 &quot;real&quot; messages, I would have 30 junk messages. My email address was on my business cards and other material, so it would be difficult to go to another email address. I purchased iHateSpam about a month ago and after some &quot;teaching&quot; the software what was junk or real, it slowly got better and better. Now, it catches 95% of my junk mail when used properly with Outlook Express own rule system. I found that it is a good idea to send the junk mail to your delelte box so you can make sure it did not just dump a good friend before deleting all of the junk. The only problem I have found with the program is when it makes or you make someone an &quot;Enemy&quot;, it is very hard to change that back to &quot;friend&quot;. Even after I remark them as a friend, the next day it still treats as ememy. Overall, it has beat everything else I tried hands down. I do wish it had a system to bombard the spamer with spam back to jam their servers as the internet community trys to save itself from this junk! David-Chicago"

80516,2,"While it's great to see Quickbooks on the Mac OS X platform, the program has two fatal flaws that most Mac users should think seriously about prior to purchasing and expecting it to work back and forth between Windows and Mac (roud-tripping) -First, it won't allow for the download of credit card or bank statements like each Windows version since 2002. I suspect that was a very highly requested feature since it was touted at the beginning of the beta period but has not be implemented. Why?Second, if a Windows file is open in the Mac, any downloaded credit card or bank statement information that was present on the Windows file that has not been input into the chart of accounts is lost when the file is open on a Mac (and therefore not even available on Windows when the file is sent back from a Mac to a PC). At least Intuit could have put that info in a &quot;holding&quot; location for use when the file got back to Windows rather than stripping it out completely.So much for cross-platform compatibility and round-tripping."
39683,0,"This was the first Nancy Drew game that I tried. Compared to most of the other games in this genre this is not a very difficult game. It is probably aimed at children around the age of 10-12. The story is very nice and you do end up learning a lot about Maya culture, putting this game in the edutainment category. The graphics are way below par and the interaction is mostly Myst like. There is not much depth added to the game to make you feel for the character you are playing.Overall it is a good game if you are taking a break from the tougher adventure games, and do not really mind the graphics and clumsy interfaces."
54661,0,"For the price...Picture It! is a suitable program that works well for the beginner.There are few, if any, bells and whistles on it. For somebody who is just starting photo editing, that could be a plus: You have basic cropping and red eye reduction features.The low points are that the selections of what you can do with the photos is severely limited: you can change a color photo into black and white or give it an antique look. This is nothing special as most digital cameras (see Hewlett Packard) come with software you can load that perform this trick. The antique look isn't sepia, just a washed out affair that makes you wonder why they even bothered giving it to you.Picture It! came with my version of PUBLISHER, which happens to be an excellent program. So, if you got it as an add-on, explore it and learn the basics before you move onto a more sophisticated program. If your digital camera came with software for photo editing and printing, you'd probably be better off using that. This isn't a bad program - just one that does little but waste disk space."

3254,1,"I think the program is great. I don't know much about graphics, but PhotoImpact is well-designed and -suited for web images (which is why I got this program.)I give Four Stars for a couple of reasons. I think the product itself deserves a five-star rating. Although the overall design is unconventional (if you are used to Microsoft Office's way of things), I like its uniqueness. I like its manual that it tells you how to customize (by setting preferences) the product to your own liking after a brief introduction in the first chapter. That's a sign of user-oriented design in my mind. You can tell that the product is web-oriented since there is a menu dedicated only for this purpose. (On the other hand, Paint Shop Pro 7 has this feature scattered around the program, it's difficult to find the quick'n'easy ways to manipulate graphics for the web.) I think the price is just right for what PhotoImpact is capable of. The program is intuitive enough, but you will get a lot better understanding if you dig through the features yourself with some help from Online Help.The negative factors are Ulead's support and the lack of available resources. While I was shopping around for a web graphics product, I contacted both Ulead and Jasc. Ulead took forever to answer my inquiries. The phone support is not toll-free. Although Ulead did eventually answer them, I am not confident that my technical issues will be answered promptly. I am guessing on this, but since PhotoImpact is probably not well-known as Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro, the general resources, on the web, books, the newsgroup, are not as abundant as for other products. That's a shame, since I think PhotoImpact is better than either one.Despite those annoyances, if you are looking for a web graphics product with a different flavor, I highly recommend PhotoImpact 6."
31337,1,"Illustrator is probably the BEST product around for anyone seriously creating drawings and artwork on a computer. It packs in all the usual features, Bezier curves, color models, line and artwork control, and it has dozens of nifty new features. These include a powerful macro facility (direct or via Applescript), a rubber stamp like &quot;symbol&quot; facility, artistic styles that can be applied to surfaces, filtering &quot;effects&quot;, gradient meshes for creating shaded surfaces, and the ability to define your own keyboard shortcuts.Yes, it has a serious learning curve. No, it is not a paint program. Yes, it has some flaws and a few bugs. No, you still have to have some artistic ability to use it.I've tried Freehand, Expression, Corel Draw and several other rivals. They are not bad programs, but they lack the completeness, the immediacy, and the sense of control that you get in Illustrator. If you are serious, you would be hard pressed to do better."
8455,1,"I recently upgraded from version 5 of Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I find that version 7 has better and faster recognition than the previous versions. I had a little trouble just now getting it to insert text into this text field in Internet Explorer. But once it got going, it is much easier to dictate corrections to text here than in previous versions.Any voice dictation system is going to be more annoying to use than keyboard and mouse, if a keyboard and mouse are easy for you to use. For those (like me) with a typing injury, this program quickly and simply takes away the need for you to type lots of text. Unless you have some sort of physical injury, I still recommend that you use the mouse and keyboard to do anything that you find annoying to do by voice.I definitely recommend this product, especially if you can find it at a good price. And yes, I DID use it to dictate this review!"

343,1,"While Microsoft has certainly made some serious mistakes in its tenure, as a developer it is hard to escape their world. WHen it comes to web applications, a good majority of the companies out there have at least some development in either ASP or .NET. This means a good developer should have a great set of tools.With the price, MSDN is not a good buy for a hobbyist. FOr a business, however, it is the best way to go, as each developer's Office installation, developer tools and all development servers (up to 10 installations for most server products) are covered with a single license. When you add up the cost of the software, it is one of the best bargains going, esp. if you develop on a variety of Microsoft servers. (In many ways, just using Visual Studio, Office and SQL Server developer more than pay for the set).In addition, you get monthly updates to your subscription, so you always have the latest Microsoft software.If you do not venture into the Microsoft world, MSDN is a gigantic waste. If you do, it is the best way to fly."

We contacted the company and they told us its because we have an up to date machine trying to run out of date software. So if you understand all you need to look for to make sure your computer can run the software, this is a wonderful program. If you're like me, you just have to buy the newest thing thats out for now.

Each function comes in a floating window which you can move to anywhere within the dialogue box that suits you, and the functions are accessed via drop down menus in the floating windows. Each window can save presets and there is in addition a preset button which allows you to access the overall presets for the relevant plugin. A full PDF file manual is included on the disk and it's a good idea to read it.Each plugin is a computer program in itself and can be used to create many different effects. I love the spray brush in the Gel plugin which creates a bubble effect when dragged across the image!I had wanted this set of plugins for some time before I took the plunge and purchased, and I have not been disappointed. It's well worth the money."

799,1,"Easy to read, very easy to navigate and easy to cut and copy scriptures. It has a search feature that can locate phrases and/or words; then provides easy access to those scriptures. Don't hesitate because of the 1996-1998 release date. This product was designed very well and is worth the list price of $65-$85. I purchased a used version for $28. WINDOWS 7 users, you will need to install XP Mode from Microsoft, and run it from there. Zondervan has some of the best comprehensive NIV bibles in hard copy and in software. Make sure it is Compton's and uses Zondervan text. (I saw some impostors.) The CD cover is vanilla and burgundy, with Jesus on a background of a map and scripture. Only downside might be that the advance search option does not have very good instructions and may be difficult for some people. To strip out the reference when using cut/paste, copy the text into NotePad first, then from NotePad into MS-Word. The hard copy Zondervan Student bible (not to be confused with their ""study"" bible) is very good too! You can't just read the bible, you really have to study it. If you don't understand, ask God to show you; you'll be awestruck when HE answers your request. Remember, to the Lord's delight, King Solomon asked for wisdom. 1 Kings 3:5-14; 4:29."
40756,1,When is the next one being released? My son 2yrs 8 months has spent hours enjoying this game. Every weekend we play it together. Highly recommended.
73768,1,Great all around productivity suite. not too many changes from 20 but still worth the upgrade
90585,0,"I love the search capabilities of Outlook 2007 but it freezes up frequently. Sometimes I will log off Outlook, wait several minutes and then shut down my PC.When I restart my PC and Outlook, I get an error message indicating that the Outlook database was not shut down properly. Then Outlook takes about a minute to scan the data for errors. This is annoying. And note: I have a very fast processor so the database scan only takes a minute on my PC. On my previous laptop, with a slower CPU, it took five to ten minutes to scan a database for errors."
61502,1,"A comprehensive flowcharting package. Having also used Visio, I find the latter easier to use when trying to impress with fancy diagrams but Flowcharter is way ahead if you really want to focus on the processes. New users may find a steeper initial learning curve as there's so much in it, especially if your first use is to draw a basic chart - but once you've found your way around, and set up your preferences, it's easy.Two niggles:1) Some of the features in the menus suggest you already have features that you'll only get if you buy the extra packages. I wish there was a setting that would remove/suppress these ""preview"" features - especially as I work alone and don't need them to interface with people that have the other packages.2) The SPC add-ins are better than when I previously used Flowcharter (version 7) but they still need improving as far as presentation is concerned; for example, text appears to be embedded as bit-maps so get very blocky when scaled or pasted into other documents."
62878,1,"I bought this software because my nephew is adopted from South Korea. He doesn't know Korean, but I know someday he'll grow up to probably have some interest in his heritage, and I thought it would be a cool thing if I knew a little Korean by that time.I worried about blowing such a wad of cash on this software, but I took a risk, and I've been very happy with what I got. I'm still in the first ""unit,"" so I have a long long way to go before I can actually speak or understand any real Korean, but I have found the exercises entertaining, and I have discovered that the knowledge does stick. Learning anything is hard; learning a foreign language so very different from English is super-hard, and learning it as an adult is downright daunting, but I'm finding that I'm not worried about that, and I'm just enjoying being exposed to something totally new.I think this software could definitely benefit from some better directions; since everything is in Korean, you have to learn even the basics of navigating the lessons just by doing, and I found that a little frustrating at first, since I was already feeling pretty overwhelmed by the weird language. And there are lessons where they're going over the difference between boy and girl, man and woman, and sometimes the photos aren't clear enough to tell what gender the subject is. I have also found some sort of bug in the written exercises, where you can click in one frame and it'll react as if you clicked in another, but that doesn't go wrong very often.I've had the software about two weeks. If you're in a rush to be able to ask the way to the bathroom on your upcoming vacation to Korea, this isn't the right approach for you. But if you're looking for a fun way to stimulate your mind and to learn something interesting and new while you do it, this is ideal."
66888,1,"This is the easiest program to use for keeping accurate information about each person listed in the data base.

83252,1,"Working Memory and Learning: A Practical Guide for TeachersAs a special education teacher, I have had a number of children who just didn't get reading, writing and math, that I just couldn't help. I wish I could go back with what this book has taught me, and try again. With the push for scientific based research and RTI, this book provides both special education and general education teachers insights and interventions for students who are suffering with working memory deficits. It is an easy read, as neuropsychological books go, and it provides scientifically validated evidence based research on how working memory affects learning. Anyone who works with special education students should read this book."
561,0,"I agree with the other reviewer. I was setting up some printouts for an upcoming birthday party and things were going great until I noticed that the cost comparisons only go to 2003. So I did a Google search on the software and found that an update for 2006 is available, but for $24.95. Now I have to decide if the upcoming event warrants the purchase of yet another piece of software that will become dated within the year."
30671,1,"At around 2 years old my son began showing interest in computers. His dad is an IT Administrator so our son was around computers all the time. Also, he was (and still is not) interested in learning the traditional way (through books, play, etc.), but rather through computers. We were NOT disappointed with this piece of software! Through this program my son has learned most of the alphabet, shapes, numbers and colors. We have had this one for about six months and he has not lost interest in it.However, there are some things that I was not pleased with. First, this product is recommended for children 18 months-3 years. It would probably be more suited for children 2 1/2 to 4 simply because it requires basic knowledge of how to use a mouse and the program does NOT teach this skill. Also, the concepts it teaches (letters, numbers, shapes, colors, music, animals, memory skills, etc.) are more geared toward the preschool crowd. Second, the layout is ""busy"" and it is hard to see all of the different entrance areas (even for me an adult). Finally, another minor complaint (it is very minor) is that the duck's voice can get annoying after 15 minutes or so for me, but my son enjoys it so this is tolerable.Overall, I highly recommend this software, however, for children over the age of two."
12485,1,"I've been running BETA versions for some time now, and am quite impressed. My hardware is fairly stock stuff, and XP has had no problems. Very stable (even earlier BETA versions), and relatively fast, if you have the hardware. I started using it on a PII 333MHz system with 128MB of RAM. Pretty pokey, especially when compared to Win98SE. But... Now that I've upgraded to a Duron 850 with 256MB of RAM, it runs quite nicely. I have a dual-boot between 98SE and XP. Once XP officially ships, though, I'll drop 98SE (not that I've even booted to SE in quite a while, mind you). Great support for home systems with multiple users, easy to use and very stable. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I think Microsoft has a winner here."
21684,1,"Alright, for those of you who are wondering, this is THE COMPLETE FANTASTIC FOUR! That's right, you won't ever need another collection!Although it does *not* include crossover issues, this fantastic dvd-rom includes every issue of the Fantastic Four ever published!I have been a die-hard fan of the old comics since I was ten, so when I popped this baby into my laptop, it actually brought tears to my eyes to see the full-color reproductions (scanned onto disc!!!) of the original comics, complete with the ads they ran with and everything!Of course, if you like the more modern comics, you need look no further! This collection, I believe, runs all the way up to 2005!I would also like to point out that Marvel has recently issued collections of its older comics, the seminal works in the series. A collection from the Fantastic Four series, containing about 20 issues, costs me anywhere from 10-20 dollars, and it's just newsprint bound in paper. Therefore, to get over 18000 pages in scanned comics for 40 dollars is almost ludicrous!I think my decision is clear - buy it, you'll never regret it!"
23579,0,I purchased this to run older Windows OS's on a new PC. It has taken a month and a half to finally find out from Avanquest that the reason this does not work is because it does not run on a 64 bit system. It is a shame because it is supposed to be a great piece of software - hopefully they will come out with a 64 Bit system soon.

80394,2,"This program is great...at first, then you get lured into it and the bugs keep getting more and more annoying until you are forced to upgrade. We started using the payroll service a few years ago and now to change would be a big nightmare, so we pay every year for upgrades and tech support for all the little &quot;bugs&quot; they put in the program. It seems that at about a year the &quot;bugs&quot; get really annoying and the program itself keeps prompting you to upgrade, asking if you need improved performance and such, which you do because I think they program it to get more sluggish so you upgrade and you are stuck. If you don't want to pay forever and ever, stay away from Quickboooks."
75287,1,"To whom it may concern:Please don't listen to &quot;togre&quot; about the activation issues. I totally agree that this information needs to be disclosed on the cover of the box but that should deter you from using the software.Software piracy cost companies billions of dollars annually. I am not sure what type of company Togre is running but imagine if piracy didn't exist, every company would be more profitable.All in all, this is a nice product to use for small business owners, I would recommend it without hesitation. As a web guru, it's nice to have a product that meet my 5 stars from an usability perspective.Good Job &quot;Best Software&quot; and keep up the good work."

Perhaps I am not using it to it's full potential, but the process of setting it up and using is very straightforward.

I will have to tinker with it more, but as of now, I could take it or leave it when editing photos."

82306,1,"This program teaches you basic words and phrases in Cantonese. (i.e. no grammar lessons). Some of the phrases are a bit geared towards tourists, such as &quot;Where are the suitcases?&quot; and &quot;Someone's stolen my passport.&quot; However, there are many different topics, so you can use it even if you are not a tourist. Some of the topics include: food, countries, colors, telling time, human body parts, and numbers (1 through 20). The games are a great way to learn the words... much better than drills and repetition. I'm trying to learn Cantonese and this software has really helped me build up my vocabulary."
5376,2,"I have been using Quicken for several years, and currenty using Quicken 2002 (I did not update after reading the reviews...THANKS for the customer reviews!). I use Q for investments and keeping up where I spend my money. I took a chance with Money 2004 Delux to see if it was any better, since Q was 2 yrs old. BAD MOVE!After using M for 2 weeks, I am going to return it ( 30 day money back guarantee....first I have to figure out where to send it). Since I use Q mainly for investments, Q has MUCH superior report capabilities. One click on Portfolio brings me right to the screen that has all the data I need......plus the capability to modify the colums for different data. To get to the same screen with M, I have to run a report, and the options for modifying the columns for data I want (e.g. daily profit, etc) are non existant.In Q, to view a list of all the securities (investments) you have, 2 clicks and you are there. In spite of going all thru the help screens, including the on-line help (which is a task itself), I followed the instructions to the T and never did find the way to show all the names of the different securities that I had in my portfolio.To top it off, I use Turbotax and I tried to download all my investment data (dividends, etc) to keep from re-entering it in Turbotax. Well, it didn't work! Only one account showed up. BUMMER!! That was the last straw.M has some good features...sorta bells and whistles....like biggest winners and losers in my portfolio for the day and some other stuff. But the basics of what I need and use are inferior to Q 2002. I sure hope the folks at Q step up to the plate and get Q 2004 fixed so that I can upgrade and stay with Q."
61884,1,My 4 yr old son absolutely loves this game. He plays it constantly! Very educational.
55851,1,"The reason I recommend this CD is the practice tests and the vocabulary builder. When I took the GRE the first time I had reviewed my math and practiced my vocab, but I was not used to doing the problems in a strict time limited environment. This CD has practice tests that mock the real GRE, so you can get used to working under a time limit, and answering the questions on a computer. The vocabulary builder was a real help too. It is a game where you try to match the words with their definitions in a limited amount of time. The only problem I have with this software is it comes off alittle cheesy and childish when you do some of the lessons. Other than that, its worth using."

If you are stuck, don't worry because there are many ways to get help. There are how to videos, searchable PDF user guides, an online forum and knowledge base on their web site, plus I found their email tech support to be quite responsive. Editing digital photos was clear-cut and easy with Photosuite, and with Storyboard you can create slide shows with mixed digital media (photos and videos) and include, pan and zoom effects, special effects and transitions, overlays, and multiple audio tracks. Sharing these productions with family and friends is easy with DVDbuilder, which lets you create projects for burning to recordable discs - DVD, Video CD, Super Video CD, or DVD on CD. Easy Media Creator 7 is an excellent product and if you aren't using it you're missing out."
18874,1,This is the first genealogy program I have purchased. I tried Roots Magic because they had a free trial version but purchased FTM 16 from Amazon because of the good deal I was able to get. It is easy to use and I have imported files from an old version of Family Origins that a relative had. My computer is 6 years old and has XP and since a review for FTM 2008 claimed it to be a memory hog I decided Version 16 would work for me. My brother has version 2008 and doesn't like it. I do wish it would show when a divorce is associated with a marriage when you view that persons page. I am very happy with FTM 16. Get it while it is still available.
12848,1,"I purchased this operating system back in November of 2002,and since then it's been great! Great realiability,great features,great looks. It's sad that some people don't like this OS. Maybe it's the activations that XP Home have that made users wary of any XP. I don't know. XP Pro is memory hogging though,and you need alot of RAM to run it at top speeds.One thing I love about XP Pro,is no activations like it's HOME EDITION. You can install XP Pro many times with the same product key! And it is as stable as Windows 2000,only prettier!If you need stability,great features,have the cash,and want to install on many systems...get XP Pro a try!"
24841,1,"When I first starting looking for family tree software I noticed some of the other software packages were companies that would try to get you to subscribe to online programs or heavily tried to get you to buy additional products. One thing I liked about RootsMagic was that this company does not do that. They let you buy the product and then leave you alone.The tutorial was quick and simple. I immediately started entering data. It was extemely easy to learn. I was worried there would be limitations on the amount of data that could be entered and also didn't know how certain things would work such as re-marriages, divorces, and step families. The program exceeded my expectations on being able to adapt to most all family situations.I would recommend this program to anyone interested in documenting a family tree or family history. I am very pleased with this purchase."
91948,0,"This Nancy Drew has a good plot idea but probably one of the easiest. The change in countries is great idea because all the others were in the states. It has some difficult challenges but not as much suspense as previous games.Most of the things she is required to do is run aroungd the city collecting things. There are not very many chances for Nancy to die or be sent home which is good and bad. It is bad because it is sometime funny to see her die but also it makes the game to easy because you cannot mess up. The ending does not really fit with the plot and the story did not build up in which then the ending would have fitted a little better. All in all, this game has some interesting innovations, such as the metro system and the case files of previous cases."
82054,1,"Though I've odered many times with Amazon, this is the first time I have been excited enough to review a product! I'm an adult who wants to learn guitar for fun and didn't want to play ""Mary had a little lamb"" and scales for months. I have only used the software for about an hour, and have already been playing parts of songs I actually like! I have been playing guitar for a total of one week prior to receiving this (without any instruction).This is perfect if you don't have the patience or desire to learn the traditional way. I wish I had this when I was 14, I would have loved it.I can't vouch for the whole thing yet, since I've only played with it for an hour, so I give it 4 stars instead of five. From what I've seen I have no reason to expect that it will let me down and highly recommend it."

Learn the Hebrew alphabet and beginning reading with the Hebrew Alphabet Tutor CD-ROM included with your purchase. Practice speaking Hebrew through exciting and realistic street scenes. Also featured is the eloquent melody of the recorder and a selection of the Psalms sung by a cantor.This is not a complete course, but its a good place to start, especially since so many get stuck on the alphabet. This CD will teach you the accurate pronunciation of the alphabet - at your own pace. Once you've learned pronunciation and reading, the dialogue section is a lot of fun! You'll like the graphics of the Israeli city: the market place, food, friends, hotel, even the taxi! It's a cultural experience."

I like it so much, I'm ordering another to keep at the office (shhh, don't tell my boss!) Well worth the minimal cost for some brain-working fun!"

69176,1,"Bought this for my wife to burn non-copy protected DVDs. It was easy to use with just a couple of button clicks. Note that the instructions and help menus aren't helpful. As another review noted, the instructions say to click on menu items that don't exist. The only problem that I ran into initially is after the burner reads the DVD, it will pop out the DVD, say it is done reading, and then hang. I had the main window open on my laptop and the main window would become unresponsive and wouldn't even minimize down. What was happening was a diaglog box opens after it is done reading the DVD and it would hide behind the main window where I couldn't get to it since I couldn't minimize the main window. You have to minimize the main window after starting the DVD read. This way the dialog box is in view after reading the DVD. The dialog box asks you to press the button after inserting the black DVD. After I figured this out, I didn't run into anymore issues and it copies DVDs just fine."

I was very skeptical when I ordered Singing Coach. After installing the program, I went through all of the lessons several times. I could see my improvement in my scores and hear my improvement in my singing. I discovered that I had been trying to sing in a range much above my natural range. I intend to continue to practice using Singing Coach. I will never have a ""professional"" singing voice, but at least now I'm not embarrassed to let others hear me sing."

The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus. This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively. I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing. The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program. In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program. They were very responsive and helpful.."
74133,1,"DVD is nice, but you have to keep stopping it periodically to catch up with the steps. The beginning shows every basic fold....EVERY BASIC FOLD....and is pretty, um, dull. But I suppose that's necessary. The rest is worth the wait. Certainly easier than reading it from a book and trying to figure it out alone."
40895,1,"I've tried many audio books, CDs, and even taking classes in order to get rid of my French accent. This program is definitely the best so far. Well worth the investment (much cheaper than taking a class) and you can go back to it over and over again. Personally I think the best way to use it is to study 30 minutes a day. There are so many words for each sound that it takes a while to master a sound. One of the best features is that you can save words for review later. So you narrow down your list of words to the ones that you want to practice in particular. Another great feature is to see the IPA pronunciation next to the word you are listening to. It really helps understand how the words should be pronounced. I love the on-line dictionary linked to [...]. It allows you to learn so many new words by just the click of a button. There are so many features that it takes a while to master them all. You need to spend 1-2 days to understand how the software works. If you don't take the time to learn, you can become easily frustrated. The only drawback is that there are quite a lot of bugs in particular when you need to download an update. Just be patient. The creator of the software is very reponsive and helpful in helping you redownload the software. I highly recomment this product. But again, practice is the key!"
12126,1,"I am amazed at some of the recent negative reviews, but you cannot please everyone. Simply put, Windows XP is the BEST operating system to ever come out of WA.To those folks who chose to upgrade to XP from ME, the problems you experienced and the bitterness you feel, is more a result of the fact that you had a virus (ME) on your system. And you can complain that the upgrade from ME to XP isnt fun, because it isnt. ME is a pain. My in-laws bought a new Dell, with ME, and ME actually nuked the hard drive. When the Dell service guy learned he would need to replace the drive, he told them 1-go to XP, ME is a virus, and 2-they got lucky in that its a fresh drive, because ME to XP conversions have HUGE issues.I just was doing one for a neighbor, and it crapped out midway through, because ME kept fighting the upgrade. Had they not cared about settings and whatnot, I would have taken WipeDrive to the hard disk and started fresh.The only other Windows OS i would run is 2000, but XP is a solid choice and with good reason.to the complaints about some legacy software not supported, or not supported well? Yes, it sucks. But MS needed to move on and up past some previous issues, and to do so in some cases meant needing to cause some compatibility issues. In the long run, it will be a good thing. but in the event of 3rd party compatibilities, it is not MS's fault if a 3rd party vendor cannot meet more stringent requirements for XP certification.Bottom line, if my mother-in-law can navigate XP safely and easily, its as good an OS as there could be for a home user."

22249,1,"This was the second game I've completed from the Nancy Drew series, and it was really good. It was fun, had a great storyline, and lots of different places to explore. The different people (suspects) were great too, to talk to them, and do things for them. Having the Hardy Boys there as well, was a nice touch, and something fun. The other features, like Nancy's phone and notebook are very helpful for solving the puzzles, and getting hints! The graphics are again, extremely good-looking, and the puzzles were challenging without driving you crazy!Hint: Have a pen and paper beside you when you play this game!Highly reconmended."
36684,1,"Visual Basic 6 is a very easy to learn language. If you have ANY knowledge of programming at all, then you will be able to pick it up in under a week. If you are a beginner, then this is the language for you. I was writing trainers for games with this language in under 10 days, and i'm only 14."
73845,1,"Hello, I'm StoryMaker, a JumpStart fan. JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade was among the first JumpStart games I've owned; only JumpStart Kindergarten (Deluxe, not Advanced, version) predates it. I think I (or someone else) got it for Christmas a LONG time ago. Since this particular version of JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade comes with 3 CD-ROMs, I will review each individually. (There is also a 4-CD-ROM version, BTW.) My review will be pretty long, 'cause it's really more like 3 reviews stuck together with little extra bits at the start & end. If you don't want to read all 3 parts, just read the first ""Fundamentals"" part and the bit at the bottom. Here we go!#1: FUNDAMENTALSThis is, by far, the BEST CD-ROM in the set. It was originally sold individually as the original JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade. In this game, a little dog named Squirt is just riding his scooter peacefully when Jimmy Bumbles, a weasel & school bully, knocks him off and breaks his scooter. Luckily, Squirt's OK, but no longer has a scooter. However, the prize for winning the JumpStart Scooter Tournament (which is coming up) is a new Super Scooter! Unfortunately, Squirt can't really win it, because...uh, he has no scooter. More familiar JumpStart friends such as Frankie the dog and Hopsalot the rabbit are determined to win it for him. However, Jimmy has supreme scooter skills, and the only way the JumpStart pals can stand a chance against him is to add gadgets to their scooters. All of your JumpStart friends will be happy to give you gadgets to add, but they need some favors to be done. Also, some of the gadgets need to be obtained in special ways. Kids complete these tasks in the form of games to earn scooter power-ups.This CD-ROM is very good. Not only are the games VERY fun, but they teach a wide variety of 1st Grade subjects - everything from math to early zoology. I think this is where I learned adding double-digit numbers, alphabetizing, and ordinals. My younger sister, Chocolate Dog, also benefited from it.This game, like other JumpStart Advanced ""Fundamentals"" CD-ROMs, has a feature called the ""All Star"". At the start of the game, kids are instructed to ""take a quiz & find out their learning style"". As a young child, I found this confusing, and I think I ended up just clicking on my favorite character. That's the bad part. The good part: In the corner of the screen of the main game, there is a star. When clicked, a phone pops up. You can call up your JumpStart pals for info on all the subjects taught in the game. Each character gives different kinds of information. I usually find Hopsalot's straightforward answers to be most helpful. Sometimes, the scientific nature-loving CJ Frog is a help. It really depends, and I don't think kids just have a single learning style.I think that JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade Fundamentals is quite good. There are a few things that bug me, though. For one thing, some games, such as Casey Cat's Phonics Soccer & CJ Frog's Spelling/Math Swamp Game, must be played over and over and over and OVER again to earn a single power-up. Because of this, we avoided them. Also, since many of the games are arcade-styled, you can sometimes get an incorrect answer simply due to obstacles, bad aim, etc. In additon, you can trade power-ups, which I think is good, but I had to go to the online user manual to find out how - it wasn't clear at all. However, this CD-ROM is overall the best one in the JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade 3-pack, hands down.#2: MUSICThough Fundamentals is very high quality, this CD-ROM, ""Music"", takes a deep dive downward when it comes to quality. In this game, Hopsalot the rabbit gets sucked up into an heirloom gramophone. Totally bogus, huh? He is whisked away to the weird & wacky world of ""The Land of Music"". A big weirdo guy named Sir Sournote is causing trouble and making all the music sour. So duh, Hopsalot has to stop him.Not only are the activities & games on this CD-ROM very BORING, but they are also very difficult. OK, so there's this game (actually, a lot of games) where you must repeat a beat. IT'S SERIOUSLY HARD. This game is for ages 5-8 and, even if you're way over the top of the age range, it is still difficult to get the beats right. And if you don't get the beats right, then the characters might insult you: ""THAT'S BAAAAAAAAAAAD!""This CD-ROM frustrates and annoys MUCH more than it teaches. Please DO NOT buy the individually sold version of JumpStart Music! You might find that your money is wasted! We have not played this LAME GAME in YEARS. If you seriously want to get it, PLEASE get it in with JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade ~OR~ get one of the 4 different JumpStart Fun Packs: Preschool, Kindergarten, 1st Grade and/or 2nd Grade. I've never played any JumpStart Fun Pack, but all of them but Preschool come with JumpStart Music. Not that anybody would actually want JumpStart Music...#3: ART CLUBJumpStart Art Club is the only disc that comes with JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade that was never sold individually. Indeed, it comes only with this pack (and the 4-CD-ROM version). It is sorta in-between Fundamentals & Music: not super good, not super bad, just in-between. In this CD-ROM, you make storybooks, crafts, banners & greeting cards starring your favorite JumpStart friends. It is pretty fun to make the crafts & entertaining to make all sorts of stories for the storybooks, but it is a very simple CD-ROM. There really isn't any animation in it, and all of the projects are simplified (the storybooks can only have up to 6 pages, you only design the front of the greeting cards, etc.). You never really ""draw"" in any of the projects - you mostly just use stickers. Coloring in spaces is the closest you ever get. Also, it really doesn't have educational value. It *sorta* teaches *a little bit of* creativity, but other than that, zero-zilch-nada. Overall, it's OK, MUCH better than Music, but definitely worse than Fundamentals.Overall, JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade 3-CD-ROM set is pretty darn good. The Music & Art Club CD-ROMs aren't so great, though, so you might consider getting the original JumpStart Advanced 1st Grade with only the one Fundamentals CD-ROM. You might consider the 4-CD-ROM version, though I've never played it. Check out some of the other great JumpStart games & workbooks! Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
5418,2,"I have MS Money 2004, which Microsoft elected to discontinue supporting the online stock/fund updates without any warning or notification to me. Money 2004 was great while it was fully functioning with the online financial updates, but now....? Why would anyone want to buy this product that Microsoft no longer produces or supports?I am switching to Quicken 2010 as soon as it is available. I have no choice."
29005,0,"This is a real good deal, compared to the prices that people normally pay where I live, in Europe (about 25-40$ for a single cd-rom). All you do is race cars around, dodging obstacles etc., but it is a nice time-passer and interactive so a little better than TV. OK, it is mindless and there's nothing to learn, but there is a place for that!Recommended, if you know what you are getting."
78109,0,"Well, I have only been using flash for about 2 years, but I thought I had a pretty decent knowledge base, Though I find Flash MX professional very confusing compared to just Flash MX 2004..... with regard to actions and interactivity even, it seems like the help menu and tutorials i have been able to find only apply to Flash 2004. So!. I guess you really do have to be a professional!. ha. but. it has worked ok for me so far, no crashes or anything, I still think Im gonna go back to MX 2004 for my next job."
53399,1,"I really like this game a lot. I am almost 8 years old and love the Disney Action game series. There are 14 fun levels of game-play. Also, you get to defeat the evil Zurg in the final battle. The graphics and 3-D animation are great, but it's kind of hard to figure out how to get past some of the higher levels. Overall, this is a really fun game for fans of Toy Story 2 or the Buzz Lightyear of Star Command cartoon."
51362,0,"Part of what helps with these clip art libraries that are so huge, is a good, easy to see printed book. This one said it came with two books and showed that they were of decent size. I received a very small, single book that is hard to see all of the artwork. It will be very hard to be creative with this small printed book."
71817,1,"I bought this product in order to get my 6 year old son more interested in learning to read. So far, he has loved using it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good program for education and fun."

38800,1,"This is a great program. I got it for my 3rd grade daughter and we both thought it was a lot of fun. It covers areas such as fractions, logic, sentence structure and geography. You have to collect different items that let you progress through the games. This is all done by completing the various puzzles and activities. The game progresses like an adventure story. You have to complete one activity before having the option to go on to others. She used the various JumpStart and Reader Rabbit programs when she was younger, and I wanted something fun to teach those basic skills now that she's older. This is JUST what I was looking for. We both highly recommend this series!"
34861,1,"I needed something that would handle SVCD better than Roxio and everyone and their brother directed me to Nero. Nero made me a coaster for every two good burns. So I downloaded six other software trials from the web and ran the month out on each of them. Within two days of using version 6 of NTI CD Maker I had deleted all other burners on my machine and ordered the serial number. Absurdly easy interface, extremely stable operation even on an old machine (P500 with a 8x burner running win98) and an inital software conflict was resolved by the program's installation interface. I have no idea why this isn't famous. Buy it and love it."
27784,0,I gave them a 3 because of something shady they pulled in an email to me.they told me it was time to renew and i would receieve a very great discount if i renewed for another year.so i said sure went to they're website.and entered the client code and guess what.NO discount at all the we going to charge me full price FULL PRICE and that includes no cd and no book and no box.so why the hell should i renew with them when i can buy the oem version of they're product at much bigger discount and get the cd???
69828,1,"Used the expansion memory card in Gdansk, Poland; Frankfurt, Germany; Paris, France; Birmingham, Luton, and Brighton, UK.Excellent for walking around each city, especially when lost and trying to return to a hotel in central Paris. It does take a little longer to acquire the satellites after changing countries, but once the location is set, the GPS was flawless.I discussed some of the Parisian restaurants that were displayed in the POI list with various hotel and brasserie staff, and the lists were current and spot on.I will never travel abroad without the Garmin - reliable and very convenient."
86674,1,I have been disappointed before when upgrading this product.But this time I was very pleasantly surprised.There was definitely a significant improvement to warrent the cost.I did not give it 4 stars because it still has a little ways to go.I have a soft and indistinct voice so it will tend to be less accurate than for others.But even so--I am very happy with the results.
85221,1,"I recieved this game in the mail yesturday, and I just cant stop playing it! This is the best version of petz ever! The graphics are updated and they look awesome!

75730,1,"I am not a real big computer guy. I have a pretty basic machine, and not a lot of money to buy a new one. A buddy recommended this to me, I bought and installed it, and it has worked just fine.It took a couple of restarts to really see a difference, and since I only have an old modem, the speed increase was pretty noticieable loading the webpagesAll in all, I think this product does just what it says."
10307,1,Good edition of office for anyone who needs a good office program but doesn't want or need to pay the price for the latest edition of the product. This will do the job with some bells and whistles but not all the flash.
86701,1,"I am a new user to Dragon NaturallySpeaking. I purchased the software just before Thanksgiving, and have been using it sporadically since. I have it on my home PC, but I am so impressed with the results, that I have requested my employer to install it on my machine at work. I am writing this review with the software, dictating it directly into the Amazon WordPad. I'm not a very good typist and my e-mail machine is a notebook computer. When I was typing,I found I was having lots of problems with the placement of the cursor. It would jump around the page, as I was writing my e-mails, inserting text in all the wrong places. I found the slightest touch to the touchpad was doing this. NaturallySpeaking has solved this. I'm still learning how to dictate and I still have many words for NaturallySpeaking to learn. However, it is very easy for me to put together a rather long document in a very short period of time. This review took me less than a few minutes. It would have been quicker had I not had to stop and think about what I was going to say next. So, if you're looking to improve you're typing or speed it up, this product is for you."
72090,0,"Program works good and pattern file updates are frequent, but don't get PC-cillin 2003 if you have more than one computer and/or operating systems.

I am a &quot;single user&quot; with a desktop and notebook. Between the two, I multiboot with 5 Windows OS's. You do the math and then decide if you want to use PC-cillin."

Inside the box (deluxe edition, anyway) is a coupon for the state rebate, or you can do it online. You can either purchase it from a store, download it, or as a ""product shipment from intuit"", whatever that means. In short, the rebate is there, up to 29.99. Hope that helps, cause I know I was confused.... [...]"
9379,1,"Both of these have saved my computer more times than I care to count, or can count for that matter. Somehow a floppy disk of mine was messed up. After consulting my friends who tried various tricks, I remembered the Norton Disk Doctor feature and it fixed the problem like that! *snaps fingers* Awesome, it saved me several days of redoing a school project. Worth every penny and I have recommended this several times.I see some complaints about the firewall which is suprising because that's the best part, in my opinion. Before I got this, my dad's computer had such bad pop-ups that the internet would freeze, my sister got a nasty virus that required that she wipe her hard drive. And I got some nasty bug that got into my start-up menu and wouldn't let me turn off my laptop without restarting about 5 + times. But ever since we installed the firewall, no one has had a major computer problem. In fact, the subscription is going to expire in a few weeks so I've already bought the 2005 version as a replacement. I see no point in trying out anything else when Norton has given such excellent results for several months!"
82780,1,"This contains Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Barbecue! Bible (Cook'n and Grill'n), and Taste of Home. The packaging is very cheap - the four CDs are snapped into a plastic holder, and all of them had come loose and were rattling around the box when it was delivered - but none were damaged. I took one star off the product for this, the CDs could very easily get damaged. Very wide selection of recipes, my mother was very happy with it."
70259,1,This product is very well put together and a wonderful learning tool for both school and yourself! I really love the detailed work put into the quickstudy series of foreign languages. Two thumbs up.
79334,1,"I recommend Smart Draw very highly. It is a versatile program - lots of templates are provided, and they are easy to adapt and modify. The symbol libraries give a wealth of images, and the program easily imports images from other sources as well (including photos). Smart Draw also easily exports designs to other programs - again adding to its versatility. I appreciate that I can make things available to people who don't have Smart Draw - I use Word and Power Point often.I have found it easier to use than other graphics programs, partly because it's so easy to edit diagrams. The documents look great too. Lots of help features are built into the program, which helped me to get oriented.I design a wide range of images for clients, from Mind Maps to Flow Charts to Floor Plans to Family Trees, and Smart Draw both inspires my creativity and simplifies my work."
89714,0,I recieved a cd with the wrong product code. the seller sent me another that also did not work. A friend tried ten codes before we found one that worked. for the price this was bad.
40379,1,MSNmoney discontinued the best stock portfolio in the world but is available with this older Money version. Now I am back on track literally keeping track of stocks that I first discovered and how they have performed since. Thanks to Cary's_Store on Amazon.
58390,2,"This program is ok, just ok, and even then, only if you have time to kill. After terribly long waits to do almost anything, you will have the nicest scrapbook pages that a three year old could produce. Amateurish to say the least. Having a lot of experience in scrapbooking has taught me that only an image editing program can truly do all the steps necessary to produce a good scrapbook page. The easiet and best of these programs is definitely Paint Shop Pro. Try to find version 9, which was produced before the unfortunate takeover of Jasc software by Corel. You will be amzazed at what you can do with this program and how easy almost everything can be accomplished."
8526,1,"I teach mentally handicapped adults with the average mental intelligence of kindergarteners and first graders. Although ultimately, this game was too hard for my students to play on a regular basis, parts of it were definitely suitable for my students in being both challenging and fun to play. I would definitely recommend this game for first graders and older and that in the beginning, it would help to play this game with your kids until you feel they are comfortable enough to play this game by themselves. All in all, a great game for Scooby Doo lovers!"
92722,1,"Overall, pretty good product, but am still familiarizing myself with all of the many features of Outlook, (love how it easily imported my old Outlook Express stuff), Word, etc. I asked a Help question and it actually answered it and the answer ""worked"", so to date, I am quite pleased."
35674,1,"I've tried learning Mandarin a few different ways, and this is by far the best way to get started. I'm about halfway through the DVD, and we've probably covered about as much as I learned in a semester I took in college about ten years ago (minus the characters, about which more below).My main recommendations are: (1) GET FLUENZ, (2) Register your copy, so you can download the podcasts, (3) If you travel, and have a phone with WM5, consider getting the version with Mobile(Fluenz Mandarin 1+2 Learning Suite + Mobile (Windows), Including DVD, Audio CD, Podcasts, Fluenz Mobile, and Fluenz Navigator. Next-Generation Chinese Language Learning Software) so you can practice without schlepping a DVD drive.PROS:- Plenty of exercises, in different forms that engage different ways of learning. Hearing, reading, and writing the words does a good job of drilling in each lesson. Compared with audio-only lessons (e.g., Michel Thomas, Pimsleur) this really helped me learn and remember tones especially.- They make it pretty easy and engaging. The software keeps things moving so it's not boring, and there's no extraneous effort required - all the exercises mean you don't have to make your own flashcards, etc. I also really enjoy the podcasts, which have a fun back-and-forth between a native Mandarin speaker and her friend who's just learning.- Very good explanations in English. Rosetta Stone drove me crazy because they had no grammar explanations, and it was impossible to figure out the patterns.- Focus on high-value vocabulary, with a lot of repetition. I've taken some language classes where the teacher made us learn pages of vocabulary we'd probably never use (""Today, we'll learn vegetables! Be sure to remember how to say eggplant!""). Instead, Fluenz introduces key words and uses them again and again in different contexts so you really learn the ones you need.- Vocabulary and grammar build on one another, and are introduced in an order that makes sense. I think they've thought this out much more so than, say, LiveMocha, which seemed to introduce concepts at semi-random.- Very good interface. It's easy to write tones, look up words in their glossary, go back, go forward, see answers, etc.- Podcast are great, especially for their dialogues which combine the lessons with stuff you DIDN'T learn, to help train you to use what you do know in real-world situations where people will use unknown vocab. BTW, the audio CD is included in the box, but it's not obvious where to get the podcasts. You just register here: [...], and then you can download them.TRADE-OFFS:- You don't learn any characters. But I think being illiterate for a while is a reasonable trade-off for being able to speak a lot more up front. After all, kids learn to talk before they learn to read- They use some simplifications early on that aren't technically correct. As another reviewer mentioned, they teach the generic measure word ""ge"" first and use it for things where you really should use a more specific one. But as they explain in the podcasts, people in China really would understand what you're saying, and Fluenz wants you to get the concept down before introducing more specific measure words.CONS:- Only runs on a DVD drive. ARGH!!! This is a big pain, because it means schlepping around my huge external drive when I'd much rather just load the whole thing onto my laptop. I understand this is for copy protection, but It's a PITA. I wish I'd realized there's a package that includes the application for mobile devices ... it would be totally worth the extra $50, and wish there were a way to upgrade.- The instructor who does the introductions and English-language explanations isn't a native Mandarin speaker, and this is a disadvantage for her pronunciation. It's not bad enough to lose a star, because all the exercises are done by a native speaker, as are most of the audio CD and the podcasts, but it's weird.I also wish there were more podcasts or audio dialogues for each lesson, using the vocabulary and grammar concepts in different ways. I find what they have really helpful, good to listen to when I'm away from home, and just wish for more.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend Fluenz for anyone learning Mandarin for the first time or brushing up on very rusty skills."
50066,1,I installed Leopard on a 1.25MHz eMac after upgrading the RAM to 1GB. Everything runs at least as fast as before if not faster. Leopard itself represents a huge difference from the OS 10.3.9 I was running previously. My favorite feature of 10.5 Leopard is Time Machine.
78993,1,"Excellent product. The 'over $450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value. During installation, the 1 year free trial to [...] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support. Ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their US Deluxe product over the phone and didn't ask for a credit card number for renewal. To me, that's a sign that they're a reputable company. Some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation CD but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the GenSmart software."
63646,1,"I am a relative &quot;newbie&quot; to Photoshop (about a year) and I put off upgrading. I guess I figured I hadn't gotten my &quot;money's worth&quot; out of Photoshp 5.5 yet. But, when I finally upgraded, I was so glad I did! I love this upgrade!Improved Layer Styles, improved Gradients, improved cropping. I know there's much more, but I still am kind of a newbie, I can't remember them all. And the most dramatic and fabulous improvement - the TEXT function! Oh my gosh! No more annoying pop-up window to type text into! You just start typing on your image. Editing and changing fonts and sizes is so much easier now. Also, I like the taskbar thingie at the top of the screen. Very convenient, I don't know how I lived without it. ImageReady is also improved. I find myself using it more and more.Also, I want to warn everyone - make SURE you have your CD of Photoshop 4 or above on hand. During the installation process, Photoshop 6 will want you to put in a previous version of Photoshop in your CD drive, to confirm you are qualified for an upgrade. They seem to only accept versions 4 or above. If you don't have a CD of at least version 4 of Photoshop, you need to contact Adobe support, and they will help you &quot;unlock&quot; the Photoshop upgrade, so that you can install it on your computer. Obviously, you must be a registered owner of Photoshop (any previous version) to qualify for this upgrade.I read on Adobe's support site that sometimes it's better to drag the upgrade installation file from the PS 6 CD to your HD. Have your previous version of PS in your CD drive, ready and waiting. Then, start the PS 6 upgrade installation from the install file on your your HD. When you come to the part where PS 6 asks for a previous version of PS, it's right in your CD drive. (This way, you avoid the annoying and tricky &quot;CD-swapping&quot; right in the middle of the upgrade. Trust me on this one!) Anyway, MAKE SURE you have a CD of a previous version of Photoshop on hand. Just having the program installed on your HD isn't enough. Contact Adobe about getting a replacement if you lost your original CD to the previous version of PS.Even though I am still a beginner/intermediate Photoshop user, I am finding MUCH to be excited about with this upgrade. I can imagine that most serious pro Photoshop users are elated. There's certainly a lot to be excited about. I cannot recommend this upgrade enough."

75250,2,"this product runs the slowest out of all of them. I tried to run it on my laptop but it would just lag to much. so then I decided to run it on my newest computer, just got it in 2006 and it is designed for gaming but it was still to slow. The software is to advanced for what you are really here for. It focuses on to many things other than making music. Although it is a little more advanced than the other ones but the beatz are kinda soft. They could have made it a little harder. But over all i recamend hip hop ejay 5. Probably the most advanced but simplest to use and good sound quality out of all of them."
25001,0,"My biggest grips with this game is not the cheating by playing out-of-turn - it is the fact that you cannot save the settings for another time.Each time you start it up - even if you have a game saved - you need to go through the tedium of manually switching off the voices for the narrator, the voice for the playing pieces - and any other settings you want changed.I like to be able to open a game / application and have it ready for me to use - Monopoly3 does NOT let you do that, you have to make all the changes to your preferences each and every time - while the narrator offers you his cordial greetings - once again.Graphics are good, cheating is bad, no save option for settings is a right pain in the behind."
78188,1,"This is an excellent program which has some incredible, incredible sounds. I have unfortunately never had the pleasure of messing around with an original ARP, but this thing sounds amazing. As the reviewer before me stated, you can save any sound patch you make. Words cannot describe how excellent this feature is. As far as programming, you have access to unlimited patch chords, and there are plenty of factory settings to explore also. I have a Behringer BCR2000 rotary controller, which is solid nobs (32 to be exact) so I get to tweak it hands on instead of with the mouse, which I would heavily recommend doing. If you need a classic sound, it doesn't get any more classic than this. It's very simple to use, as long as you have some experience in programming synths. I really enjoy this, and would recommed it. I'm using an OSX mac, and this rocks on it."
92188,2,"I bought this program because it said it was easy to use on the box, well it turned out it was anything but that. I couldn't figure out how to use the different options and after about an hour of playing with it .. I gave up."
72612,1,For anyone who loves the Residence distinct sound this is a great one and I highly recommend it to any true fan.
53938,1,It has many good exercises. Good to learn and have fun. I believe the first product for Lithuanian language study that will not bore you to death. Great stuff for an awesome price for beginners! I loved it.
21831,0,"Having owned SnapStream products in the past, these do a fairly decent job, especially for those who wish to transfer their recorded TV shows to another device, such as a PSP, or a Pocket PC, this will convert your TV shows to those formats. However, the quality of HDTV just doesn't compare to Vista Home Premium's own Media Center. I would probably recommend that one go with Windows Vista Premium or Ultimate, or MCE 2005. There are other programs that can convert TV recordings better than Beyond TV to an MPEG format for other devices."
30367,1,"My three year old loves playing ""Finding Nemo"" I love the educational, memory building games as well as the movie clips... a reward for completing 5 levels of play on each challenge. The feeding the shark ping-pong is a fun, slightly challenging game, and my son loves to swim with the sea turtles and play the ""concentration""-type rock roll game. There is also a traditional ""shell"" game and a ""simon""-like memory game in which you repeat shape patterns made by the moonfish. And of course, the highlight is the swimming with nemo adventures. I would highly recommend this software. It was easy to install and it's easy to use. My son can play it all by himself, changing games as he likes. He really likes the independence."
49796,1,"After becoming frustrated with the way Cakewalk handles system resources, I began to shop around for another option for my main recording software. A couple of years back I tried a fully functional demo of Samplitude (also made by Magix) and was highly impressed, though it was rather out of my price range. Just recently I found Music Studio in a local store, and the screen shots caught my eye because it resembled Samplitude so closely.Hoping that this program could handle system resouces much like its bigger brother, I decided to take a chance. For $70, I found it hard to argue with. To put things into perspective, I'm running a 900Mhz processor with only 384 of RAM in XP. With Cakewalk, I could usually get up to 8 tracks before I noticed my resources starting to take a major hit. Real time effects were out of the question, except for maybe a general reverb patch. With the Audio Studio portion of Music Studio, I recently recorded up near 30 tracks, rerouted via virtual submix busses, EQing most channels, and adding some real time processing, and my system was perfectly fine. And if a situation might come up where your system is being hammered, Music Studio offers the option to freeze tracks in order to clear up resources.Further, although it lacks some of the nice additions that Samplitude has, all of the everday basic features (and then some) are still here. The wave editor has some nice features for cleaning up tracks, and the time stretcher, when set to ""Smooth"", produces some impressive results. The various scopes and meters are a nice touch (spectroscope, phase correlation, oscilloscope, spectrogram, and more).I really enjoy the realistic layout to the mixer view, along with the ability to assign a particular mixdown to a preset so that you can save and compare up to six separate mixdowns side-by-side.It would be nice to have MIDI and audio built into one single program, but most of these issues can be resolved by downloading a free virtual MIDI router. I suspect (though I could be wrong) that these (MIDI and Audio) are two separate programs in order for the Audio portion to be programmed strictly around audio to allow for better handling of resources. The reason I suspect this is that I have generally had poor results with programs that feature audio and MIDI capabilities in one program. I could upgrade my system, but it makes a strong statement for a program to be able to produce the results that Music Studio does on the resources I have available.In short, if you enjoy recording as a hobby and want quality results, Music Studio is the way to go. There will be a slight learning curve, but with a little work you will feel right at home and content with this program."

71886,1,"I first got this game was I a kid. I loved it then and I still love it now. Perfect for family home evenings, lessons on LDS Church History, family histroy lessons, and for kids learning about the Oregon Trail or life in the mid 1800's. And at the price its being offered, its a steal. Even now as an adult, I still find the game educational and entertaining. And if your a LDS parent who can't afford a Church History vacation, take it in your living room with all your kids by playing this game. The first edition was cool in a 16 bit mode but the second edition is more colorful, realistic and educational. Happy hunting!"
27142,1,"I am thoroughly enjoying this game, esp. the competitions. The grooming does get a little old every once in a while, esp. once you have won several horses. I like that the game has 3 levels (easy, normal, hard) and that you get different horses to choose from and even different color clothing to choose from when you ride. Practicing is fun, so is galloping on the beach and blasting around the trails. I also like that you can pace your horse during practice and the competitions - he walks, trots, has 4 different canters/gallops and backs up. Like one other reviewer, I am a lot older than most of the people who play this game (early 40's), but I grew up showing horses and missed being able to do things with horses so I looked for a computer simulation. This game has really met my needs. I bought another game called ""Jump and Ride"" and it is horrible - it takes forever to move from screen to screen, there are no courses and the animation is pretty bad. Just FYI. Now, one more thing: The only problem I am having with this game is catching or following the ""night rider."" I get messages like ""you got too close and the rider saw you"" or ""you were unable to follow"" when he jumps the boulders. If you have solved this problem, please write a review of this game and put in the solution. I've tried various ""cheat"" sites, but couldn't find a thing. Thanks!"

21413,1,"My six-year-old loved this game. That is, until I had to make him take a break from it because the adaptive difficulty was moving him too quickly. He was getting multiplication problems right (but taking forever because he was doing problems like 12x9 by taking 12+12+12+12+12+12+12+12+12--he didn't have the problems memorized yet), so the game bumped him up to division. he's just not quite there yet, so he can't play the game again until he is, which is a shame because he loves the game."
2706,1,Great for managing your basic accounts and finances. Easy to use. Worth the price. Interacts well with online banking services.
64511,1,"Started this one without a walkthrough. When I finally found one, I restarted the game. It is a time based game, so certain things happen or are available at certain times. Good graphics and audio. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to Stay Tuned for Danger."
14155,1,"It took a little time to go through some of the activities at first, but once my 4yr old got used to it she is able to play game (mostly) by herself. She especially enjoys the part where you look in a picture for items that start with a certain letter.Although if you intend this to be a teaching tool you do need to play it with your child, since I found my daughter was just clicking though some lessons and not really trying to complete the objectives. Some parts of the game are very repetitive, and those were normally where she was clicking just to advance the story.I reinstalled Windows XP on an old computer from 2002 (1.2GHz, 256MB ram, 1MB video, 40GB HD, 16x CD) and this plays fine, although at times a little slow and some hesitation when loading between puzzles. I would recommend a bit faster setup, more RAM and discrete graphics would help a lot, but this should work fine on almost any computer from 2004 onwards."
14587,0,"I banged out a no-frills website in a few hours with Frontpage 2002. It is true that if you cut the software loose to generate all of the Microsoft exension code that the result is not very compatible with many ISP servers, e.g. AOL. If you just disable all of the options (in the compatibility area of page options)and use Frontpage to generate the rough HTML for a page layout it does save time and effort, like avoiding all of the table layout grunt work. You will have to have some HTML coding and enough Internet/website construction knowledge to be able to fly by the seat of your pants, as it were, and actually get the website up to your internet server and make it function (the latter is mainly a matter of keeping an eye on the way the web page files are generated, so you don't end up with unnecessary folders within folders and generally server-annoying voluminous subfile references--if you keep it simple and just generate your own htm/html files (i.e., don't let Frontpage run wild with its own maze of folders and subfolders and machine-made spaghetti code) and upload them yourself to your webserver (keeping an eye on the url/relative file link information for your pages) it is a pretty nice tool for about half of the Macromedia Dreamweaver MX Fireworks product (which admittedly I would rather have if I had $300 bucks to spare)."
44854,0,"I used my friends 2.0 version and liked it, but it had problems downloading from my Garmin e-trex unit.Good things: 3D, profile building, different zoom levels and covers the whole U.S. The funnest software package I have. I can go out and map a mountain or road bike course and get an idea of mileage and elevation gain and loss before I go. I print out the maps to take with me.Bad things: Don't expect it to give you the detail of a 7.5 minute Topo map. For life and death dependancy on a map then buy a more detailed map before you head out. Also don't depend on a GPS because it's batteries may die on you.My Garmin downloads but it doubles up on my tracks. I have called Delorme about it and they are suppose to look into it.Bottom line: For $100 to get this much information on the whole US with all of it's features, I am amazed. Sure this is not a perfect program but in my opinion it is a great one. Great for area overviews and in most cases it will get you there and back."
33987,1,I am a huge Nancy Drew fan! I have solved and own all the games and never get tired of them. Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake and Secret of the Scarlet Hand are some of the longest and hardest games (thats good by the way)!Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake's mystery is all about dogs haunting a house by Moon Lake that one of Nancy's friends own (she left so you are all alone). This game is definitly on the scary side because of one of the beginning scenes so this game probably is recommended for ages 10 and up. The game is long and has fun puzzles and funny characters. I loved the dogs in this game!Secret of the Scarlet Hand definitly takes a while to get in to because at first all you are doing is learning about the Mayans and doing tasks. However after the theft the game gets very interesting with twists and turns that will get you hooked. The game would probably be hard for younger kids to comprehend and really get into (they'd probably get kind of bored) but the game is great for history learners.Overall these games are great and I play them over and over! I love the Nancy Drew games and can't wait for the 16th game to come out later in 2007!
35921,1,"I can't beleive I'm first to review this! This is the only time that's happened. I will devide this into sections saying what's good and bad about each one. We'll start withTHE PLOT: A queen bee magically shrinks Frankie small because he digs up the entire backyard because he thinks it's his own. He pertends he's on a show called, ""How to make a mess in your own backyard"" hosted by Frankie, top digger. He meets another bee named Ruby and a worm who hates Frankie because he was top digger. Now that Frankie's small, he's the top digger and he plans to keep it that way. He must play games to win the bones he burried so he can make a stair case up to the behive, collecting magic dog tags on the way.ANT ROUNDUP: Frankie meets an ant who talks like a cowboy. He needs help getting all the ants to bed even though it's still daylight. You have to open gates to herd the ants into the proper bedrooms. You have to organisie the ants by all sorts of regulations which they don't tell you. I like this game."
62289,1,"I highly recommend this CD series. My son started playing with it at the library when he was 3, and learned so fast that we bought the program for our home. After just a few months, he's sounding out words, reading street signs, and is very enthusiastic about learning. Mattie the rabbit and her friends are cute sweet creatures that captivate a child's attention, and their antics are funny enough to make adults laugh. My son likes the different accents used and the animation as well. An A+!"

95027,1,"Endnote 9 escapes some of the apparently terrible glitches with Word that plagued version 8 (which I have heard about but haven't tried).Some of the other features haven't changed since Endnote 5, including the essential Z39.50 search feature. What this means is that you can click on ""Connect"" and go to the Library of Congress or other libraries or databases (OCLC FirstSearch, for example, although this one requires a password) and download the entries directly into Endnote. You then have all the references in your own Endnote library without even going to the library site. For example, if you need to search Psych Abstracts, you can use the ""connect"" feature to search for and download the references, including the abstracts, right into your Endnote library.Also, most university libraries have a feature through which you can select and download your citations into Endnote, Procite, or RefWorks. I don't know about the ""drag and drop"" feature touted by the company and complained about by another reviewer because with the other automated ways of generating citations that Endnote provides, I haven't used it.Yes, there are a few quirky features that still linger from the old versions. The interface isn't as modern as, say, Procite's, but Endnote still works well. It is well worth purchasing and will save you many hours of additional work if you are a graduate student or academic. I'd seriously consider it for undergrads, too, if only for the time and headaches saved in converting from format to format when you're writing papers. Does anyone really want to memorize the differences between CBE, MLA, APA (5th ed), Chicago A, Chicago B, and so on? I didn't think so, and with Endnote, you don't have to; the program will automatically format these references for you.*Note: Some of the language in this review is the same as one I posted for Endnote 5, since the features are the same."

68285,0,"My dv camera had no video input option, only output, so I wanted something that would allow me to record from tv/vhs/dvd. I bought this product because it was the only option for me at the time so I learned to deal with any of its flaws. It takes a while to open and has crashed a few times, but the times it has worked correctly far outnumbers that. It will occasionally drop frames if the vhs quality is too rough. If I'm only recording a short clip and I see frames have dropped, I'll simply stop recording and start again and that seems to fix it. I've never had a problem with video and audio sync, not even after an hour of recording. I could let my computer go to the screensaver and come back after a long time to find its still recording properly with no dropped frames. After recording it automatically saves the video in its entirety in your videos folder. The quality is decent and you have a few quality options to select from. The editing is pretty basic, but you can split clips down to the smallest time increments. No complaints about exporting. I've done very little editing with this program. It's easy to work with, but I don't love the setup. I already had premiere elements installed, so as soon as the capture was over I would close the program and do my editing in premiere. There were problems opening some video files that were already on my computer though.I bought this package for the video converting which has served me well over the years. I would give that aspect 4 stars. As for the program used to work it, I would give it 2. This program doesn't work with windows 7 64bit. There are better options for better prices."

Thought I needed a new PC. Turned out, I just needed a new OS.However, I am extremely disappointed that SuSE does not support RAID. Am unable to install it successfully on a small server with RAID. The installation allows me to select and install the AACRAID drivers into the kernel. But, the boot hangs. When I contacted SuSE, they informed me they don't support RAID.Again, great product for the PC/Laptop. If you want Linux on a server using RAID, try another distrobution."
23346,0,"As far as the software goes it tracks your small business activities fine. The problem is that the program is hard to work with and hard to find your way through. The documentation and help menu's are poor at best. For the price of this software, Intuit should provide the documentation manual with the software, not expect you to buy it separately. You would expect them to be better at documentation than this."
60423,0,"I want to make clear that this is essentially Sea Dog's 2 and has little or nothing to do with the movie Priates of the Caribbean. However, if you want a down to earth, well rounded, ship/land based naval game set in the sixteenth century; POTC will deliver.You begin the game as an unknown freebooter with a small ship. You follow the onscreen script as a sort of tutorial and learn how to move about on land, fight with a sword and pick up items. From there you disembark from your ship with the choice of doing pretty much whatever you want. You can choose to deliver cargo as a trader or fight for one of the five nationalities (six including Pirate), or anything else that can make you some ""coin"".Much of the game play is similar to SD1 and the controls are almost identical. Contrary to what some may say, I found the controls to be rather simple and easy to learn although bothersome to change. Character relations with people grow throughout the game and your reputation will change based on the choices you make. For example, if you deside to play the game in a cut-throat fashion, killing all who step in your path and plundering every ship you see, you will begin to be feared and this will have an effect on those you talk to.The learning curve is steep but add's an element of realism to the game. You need to use your judgement when traveling at first or risk being attacked by pirates. The graphics are astounding, showing every ripple in the water and every drop of rain. Sunsets are moody and filled with emotion, it is really something to see. Ships will now have a crew bustling around on deck although their animation is somewhat blocky and pre-mapped (it all looks the same after awhile).The soundtrack is great for anyone whose a favorite of those long classical scores (i.e. Master and Commander) and will change with your environment. You can now get ambushed in the city and will have to defend yourself with sword, knife, pistol, or whatever else you happen to have. Items are abundant throughout the game. Some give you skills, others for combat but you can view them all in the (albeit clumsy) inventory menu.Unfortunately the game has some downfalls. Character interaction sometimes seems a little rushed and the game has some issues with bugs. The Bethesda website devoted to POTC is a joke and hasn't been updated since the game shipped to stores and no official patch has been released to the public. This is where my 3/5 star rating comes from.However now for the best part of POTC, the mods. A number of websites have posted mods for downloading, one in particular is called the ""Build Mod"". It incorporates an array of upgrades such as new ships, wearable clothing, 100's of new quests and characters to interact with, and the ability to change the character you play as (you can now be Johny Depp, Will Turner, or a ton of others). Ontop of this you can now berth ships at islands and feed your crew so they don't mutany. If only this mod had been released with the game, then it deserves a 5 star rating.Bottomline: POTC is a great addition to the Sea Dog's line but falls short of being as good as it could've been. If only Bethesda could have released a good patch for the game or an expansion, fortunately the player created mods have solved most of the problems and actually added some elements. For fans of Sea Dogs, there is no other choice.-Xantier M. Werner"

The various levels maintain the challenge for the student. The CD is easy to use. I appreciate that the steps in the process were outlined and all I needed to do was to follow them. However, one can also choose to skip steps and still benefit from the practice with the CD. I definitely recommend the CD for all students of French who want to understand and be understood. Thanks Christian!"

They both love it and cannot get enough of it! They enjoy bringing their creations to life (everything from unicorns to pink poodles to butterflies). I would definitely recommend this product to any parent/aunt/uncle/etc. who wants to give the child in their life a new twist on expressing their creativity."
10987,1,"There are a few other software products that you could use that try to do the same thing as InstantCopy, but none do it better or as easily:DVD95Copy: Still had a few bugs with the audio stream processing when I tried it, and it will not burn directly to discs.DVD2One: Does not currently do DVD9->DVD5 copies (although they are working on this for the next version) and does not burn to discs.DVDXCopy: Does not currently do DVD9->DVD5 copies, but will make an exact copy of your source DVD by spanning two discs (this requires you to swap discs during playback.)Cool features of InstantCopy:- Lets you keep all content and menus if you wish.- Offers one-click automatic processing if you are a novice.- Allows you to choose video tracks, subtitling tracks, and audio streams to include in the copy.- Allows you to individually tweak the compression used on the various video tracks if you want to. (This is useful in boosting the quality of the main feature, while turning down, or eliminating the disc extras that you might be less interested in.)- Burns directly to your media (DVDR or CDR)."

62477,0,"Street and Trips 2002 has a lot of features that are very easy to use. Surprisingly, the response is extremely fast even when calculating long and/or complex routes. The ability to dynamically change a calculated route by dragging it to a different position is fantastic.There is, however, a major problem: the map data is out of date. Several spots near my home are almost two years out of date. Other spots I am familiar with in the state also suffer from incorrect data as well as some incorrect road naming.As for the comments about the GPS function, I don't use it and I would bet most users have no need for it. I do use GPS while on foot and know that the unit itself, a high end version, takes time to react depending upon the satellite visibility and surrounding terrain. Inside a fast moving car, a handheld GPS will not react instantly regardless of software. This is especially true in a city or town due to the numerous obstructions."

All the existing software packages I have tried (5 so far), seemed like they were missing something. Vegas Movie Studio made me wish I never wasted my time on the other packages out there!I can time splice my MPEG 2 recordings to easily remove commercial breaks and easily create the remastered video back to MPEG. I have no noticeable delays while editing either. The video software also features layering which I am using to display messages from time to time.If you decide to use this suite make sure you have at least 1gb of memory to bring it to it's full potential.The DVD creation software is remarkable. As a programmer I enjoyed the ability to tune each menu object's parameters from the tool windows. I created a Flash file for the intro menu and was able to easily load it in. DVD burning is very fast.I really feel I am just scratching the surface of what this software can do. The manuals that came with the software are easy to read and informative.Finally, if you are in the middle of a tape to DVD conversion take a look at the K-World DVD Maker PCI card. I am able to rip 720x480 video from old UMATIC tapes seamlessly at almost 30fps."

PowerQuest's PartitionMagic 8.0 was a great program, then they came out with the update to it (which is suppose to help) and it screwed my computer up. This program has a great UI; very user-friendly! The biggest problems, excluding the patch, has been the DOS version of this (which is included on the CD) and the fact that is will not run on my 64-bit system. So, unless you're running an Athlon 64-bit processor (or another processor that has 64-bit extensions) this program is great!"

36943,0,"This is a very complicated software package with so many options it can be intimidating due to the lack of intuitive function for each of the options you can select. Maybe if you're into the construction business you will understand some of the terms used, but I don't get many of them. A comprehensive glossary would be helpful to show what each of the design options means. But given this is an attempt to put home design within reach of the masses, perhaps it's the price we have to pay. Prepare for a steep learning curve!I have struggled with the elevation settings ever since I got the package installed. Trying to put the house footprint onto the site plan has been difficult; at times, the software puts the structure underneath the terrain and I can't figure out why. I have a narrow sloped lot and getting the house to fit with a daylight basement was the goal of getting this software. I'm still trying to identify the key variables after several weeks.The wall textures seem to be reversed each time I have created a floorplan. The result is the exterior of the structure has the texture of inside walls showing and vice versa. I've had to manually fix each wall after building a plan.The wall cutting tool is hard to use. It doesn't clearly show exactly where the cut is being made. Only after you select the cut-out section do you see what part of a wall is actually being removed.Many of the roofing options are very hard to decipher. Putting a roof over a bay window has proven to be a real chore with trial and error being the only way to figure out what the end result is going to look like. Lots of wasted time.Building a porch have proven hard when trying to specify if the porch is over the foundation or an extension from the foundation. I'm still not sure I have it figured out.The room build wizard is the best way to start out to get a basic floorplan generated. Building a wall at a time is painfully slow. And the instructions state you must build walls in a clockwise pattern or they won't all connect up properly.Having the ability to place furniture in rooms gives you a better sense of how practical your design really is.The framing view is so small it is impossible to see any detail of the lumber. I have yet to figure out how to zoom in."

The interface is pretty good for searching through this monster, and automates the easy export to a wide variety of formats for various uses.It's important to note that despite the &quot;media&quot; statement at the top of this page, this is on DVD, not CD-ROM; which is a good thing, as the 30GB of pictures would take up nearly 50 CDs, weight a ton, and need a much bigger box!"
38626,0,"Although there really isn't a whole lot in this software suite that's terribly new, it's still worth taking a look at. From what iI can tell iPhoto simply scrolls a little better and added a photocast ability (which sounds fun but is a little less practical than one might think). There are some cool additions to iDVD but its still not as customizable as I would like. I haven't used the new iMovie yet, and probably won't (because I have FCP). Garage band has more features but most serious musicians won't use it anyway so what's the point? The most exciting thing about this suite is the new program iWeb. This is a fun program and when you play around with it you can create some cool websites. Overall though, not as much freedom as I would have liked. The other MAJOR downside is that a lot of the cool features require a .mac membership to take advantage of. iWeb in particular is more or less worthless without it. As much as I love the Apple line of products, it is semi-expensive upgrades with minimal new features that make me question my loyalty. Buy it if you can get it for cheap or if you just can't live without it. Otherwise think twice."
12541,1,I first installed the upgrade just as soon as I recieved it and had compatability problems.So then I reformatted my hard drive and installed Win98SE and then immediately upgraded to XP.Then I went to the net and got all of the latest drivers for my hardware and it has been trouble free since.Now I couldn't think of going back to 98 or ME.I love it especially the stability.

41551,1,"While playing on a computer at our library, my children visited Trudy's Time and Play House. They each would play for about 30 minutes and throughly enjoyed it. So, I purchased it through Amazon.com for a very reasonable price. In my daughter's own words, ""I get to work in three levels of time, hour, half-hour, and all other times. After I complete this they cheer for me when I get it right. If I get it wrong, I get another try. There is a spaceship to take me around the world and show me different places and things about that part of the world. Then there is a quiz. If I get the answer right, they cheer for me. When I get it wrong I keep trying. There is a sandbox. I get to click on tiles to complete puzzles that make cities, rivers, roads...There is a game where an ant has to find jellybeans. As the ant finds each colored jellybean, it turns the color of the jellybean it finds. Then when all the jellybeans have been found, they cheer for me."" As a parent, I am pleased with the education aspects being presented in a positive and understandable way. I will be looking at more products by this company."

39156,1,"I purchased VC Plus after reading about it's various awards. It truely does what it claims. I bought the Logitech Pro 4000 webcam to use with it at the same time. Installing both products, configuring the camera, setting up proper lighting (two 500-watt halogens from my garage bouncing light off the ceiling), and tweaking the green-screen background effects took about two hours altogether. After that, wow! Recording professional broadcast videos on my PC (Athlon 1600XP with 512MB RAM, GeForce 2 400MX, and WinXP Pro) is easy and fast. Honestly. I'm recording a series of training videos for clinical microbiology students. Incorporating PowerPoint slides (as JPEGs) and shot video from a DV camcorder is easy. Adding screen shots of Windows apps (alt+PrtScn) is also easy (use Paint to save to JPEG first). All this content can be set to trigger during broadcast recording with various transition effects (they give you tons of effects to use). You can rehearse as often as you like, then do a recording. After that, you then publish the recording in either AVI or Windows Media format (I strongly suggest using Windows Media format); you can use third party apps to convert an AVI-published broadcast to Real or QuickTime formats, but I found the Windows Media format to give the smoothest and sharpest display with excellent compression. Why bother with anything else? Soon the SeriousMagic website will offer an upgrade to allow recording in Windows Media 9 format (which is absolutley unbelieveable in quality and compression). The VC Plus package microphone worked fine, but I suggest laying the included green-screen fabric on the floor and placing books on it to reduce the fold creases, otherwise fine lines will appear in your recorded background. There is a new (11/02) VC Pro version available only on the SM website, but the extra cost (double) did not justify the price for my needs right now. VC Plus gives you everything you need to make terrific training or announcement videos for any purpose. Wonderful stuff. Also included is an Alpha GC Titling editor that you can use to create your own broadcast-quality screen titles and text (if you don't like the numerous included ones). The manual is great, but I wish some extra ""advanced"" tutorials were included or available on their website...I'm already moving beyond ""novice mode"". Gone are the days of tedious video editing. You can add MP3s and WAV music clips anywhere along the broadcast. Truely nifty. The SM website has loads of sample videos to watch before you decide to buy. VC more than delivers as promised. By the way, I don't work for the company...I work for a rather large medical center in Los Angeles."
40338,0,"So I pay $100 for a software, comes in a cheap box and even the cd/dvd is cheap, it's one of those u buy at a retailer and burn ( with the blue area ). I was pretty disappointed that it looks as if someone made it in his mom's basement.Then insalling it, everything fine.. but again I feel disappointed, it felt empty.. I thought it would do a lot more than what it did, I feel that it does not do enough to be worth $100. Does it do the job right ? I have no idea, I can't really tell much difference on my laptop."
88428,1,"With GB, Apple gives you 1000 loops to make songs with. After awhile, you'll find that you've done you can with them and lust after more.With Jam Pack 3, they got the bases covered. Lots more loops and some real tasty guitar licks. Sure there are drums and whatnot, but what I was looking for was more variety in guitars and this really hit the spot."
44685,0,"This is very basic budgeting software but the cost is low and will at least get you pointed in the right direction of your budgeting plan. The price is next to nothing so it's hard to complain about its lack of features. The seller was quick, I wouldn't shy away from ordering from them again."
79471,1,"I downloaded ProShow Gold v3.0 the other night after hours of toying around with 4 or 5 slide show programs that came with equipment packages. (I've done quite a bit of video editing and originally planned to use that software, but it squashed portrait photos and I needed to get a job done). After hours I could only conclude all ""free"" bundled software for slideshow editing is junk.So I started up PSG 3.0 and found the interface was competant. There was room for my WMA, or MP3 or Wav audio which I pre mix with Music Studio. I imported the slides, set the auto timer to match the music and ran into my only problem with PSG3.0. It appears all of the slides load into RAM and if you have too many (I had 300 slides with I think 500 Meg on my laptop)the program chokes.Now I knew 300 slides was more than I could expect any audience to watch anyway so I cut the number (and organized them using letter prefixes) then loaded 140. After that the program worked like a breeze.There is quite a lot I have yet to do with this PGS3.0 and am anxious to start. The pan and zoom features are especially remarkable as they add an incredible amount of focus and grace to a production. My bottom line is that for $80 this is a program I can work with and can, together with a separate audio editor, create a slideshow I can be proud of."
33944,1,It's a pretty good program over all and pretty easy to use!
29686,1,"I don't know what people are complaining about here. I got my copy at a pretty low price--about $30.00 which is a lot cheaper than the other editors out there. You can't expect top notch quality at a low price.However, once you learn to use this product it is actually pretty good--except it doesn't convert Quicktime and some AVI files right. However, if you use one of the other various formats such Realplayer and Windows Media Player formats it is an excellent product. There are a lot of good things this product does if a person takes the time to go through it and figure out what it does."
46327,0,"I picked this up in the hopes of visualizing some possible landscape options for our front and back yard without having to pay a professional landscaping firm for a consult.First, the good. The tutorial videos are straightforward, easy to follow, and easy to learn from. The user interface is also pretty good, and I managed to make a reasonable approximation of our house in under 20 minutes. There's also a ton of trees, plants, shrubs, and so on, and the ""zone finder"" is very helpful in narrowing down what will grow in your particular area.Now the bad. If your yard is at all hilly in an unusual way, that is, if it's not perfectly flat or gently sloped, you're going to have a nearly impossible time getting your yard laid out with this software unless you have a degree in cartography. I consider myself pretty bright, and pretty adept with maps, and I still cannot manage to lay out my yard correctly with this software. Given, I have an unusual yard. The driveway slopes down, but the front yard remains level until it hits a 5' retaining wall. The back yard has at least three distinct levels. Still, this software claims it can handle odd yards, but it does a poor job at it.Second, if your tastes in landscaping run to the extreme, hire a professional. There's plenty of ""garden variety"" gardens in this software, but if you're looking for unusual water features, perhaps asian-inspired accents (very popular here in the Pacific NW), look elsewhere. While heavy on plants, decks, and lawn furniture, anything unique or slightly out of the ordinary isn't included here. My own design called for a basalt fountain. Not to be found, even for download on the website. And oddly shaped stone patios? Don't even try, unless you want to individually model every stone. You may as well just skip the software and get right to real landscaping.For a vast majority of people going with very tried and true, non-experimental and non-extreme landscaping designs, this will probably be very adequate software. Want to arrange some flowers, trees, and bushes on your mostly flat yard? This is money well spent if you have no talent with pen and paper. However, if you're looking for a solution to unlock your hidden creatvitiy, look to a professional, or stick with your existing artistic skills in the medium of your choice."
62962,1,"My son, who is barely two, started playing with this about a week ago and is now a ""mouse master."" He can open/exit the program by himself and navigate through the basic menu to play the games he wants. There are no ""wrong clicks,"" so it's very easy to use. Includes counting, colors, ""first words,"" opposites, body parts, etc. Really is an amazing program that requires ""active"" participation. Much better than sticking your kid in front of a video for twenty minutes. I'd recommend this to any parent with an extra computer sitting around the house."

6015,0,"While I feel secure with this product and am thoroughly satisfied with the antivirus software, it has the annoying tendency to ignore the user's orders. Specifically, the software allows you to allow, deny, or automatically configure other programs on your computer which try to access the Internet. But after you provide a setting, weeks later it will ask you again whether to allow, deny, etc. as if the program is totally new and had no idea what settings you had put in previously. In the long run this becomes tedious and annoying. However, friends have had the same trouble with McAfee..."
74193,1,"I've only been using this program for a week now but i'm loving it. It does however, some of the time, have an error pop up when your trying to start it... but everytime i go to restart the program, it runs fine... Didnt take me long to figure out how to work the program."
86277,1,THIS IS THE BEST AND EASIEST SOFTWARE TO USE WITH 7 UTILITIES BUILT INTO ONE PROGRAM(LESS ROOM TAKEN ON YOUR HARD DRIVE)...VERY FAST RUNNING...EXCELLENT GRAPHICS....SO EASY THE BEGINNER COULD USE YET HAS FEATURES ONLY AN ADVANCED USER WOULD EVEN WANT TO ATTEMPT TO USE...AWESOME ..MY DAD GOT ME STARTED WITH THEIR ORIG.

46198,1,"Elements is a program that is packed with many of the same features as the more expensive full version Adobe Photoshop. The features that it doesn't have, like duotones, channel palette and Quickmask, can be worked around with an extra step or two. It is a terrific value.That said, the learning curve for those new to the world of Adobe, can be pretty steep. I should know - I use it to teach a digital scrapbooking class at an Educational Center in California (yes - a FREE course). For those of you who have not used Adobe Products before, there is 3 to 5 ways to do just about everything - this can be confusing for beginners. Besides a menu bar with drop down windows, there is a toolbar, a tool editor, as well as palettes that dock and separate from the main menu bar. The Layer Palette (A wonderful and useful thing) seems to be particulary hard for beginners to understand.My suggestion is, if you are just starting to use Adobe product, find a school and take a course BEFORE your purchase. Most of my student do end up buying the software, or a scanner that includes it, by the end of the semester."
38811,1,"I love the Cluefinders series. I discovered it in a pack of learning software and have always loved it since. They are very good at combining entertaining plotlines with educational games.This particular game is one of my favorites, partially because the plotline is the most interesting and the games still challenge me even though I'm no longer in fifth grade (Which makes me sound stupid I guess)To start off, I'll talk about the games. The games generally combine fun with education. One game has you rearanging stories, which I find really fun, and another has you figuring out geography puzzles- like, how can you get from Iowa to Tenessee without crossing the Mississippi river? They are also challenging for most kids- though some might need adult help. For example, in that geography problem, I couldn't figure it out because I didn't realize you were allowed to cross water- the gulf of Mexico. Another game, that has you putting together electrical circuits, is also very fun- the first few times, but you don't learn anything new by having to repeat it twelve times. But overall they are fun, and fairly educational and challenging- I'm not very good at judging educational value; keep that in mind hearing that.I probably already said I love the plotline. This is where Cluefinder's games really stand out; they interwind the plotline with the games so well I don't find it irritating. The characters are also funny and interesting. Although this plotline seriously tests your suspension of disbelief, I usually put up with it because it's entertaining and makes the game fun. And it's not good to be analytical I guess. It also is a good motivater to continue the game- they keep the plotline moving as you play, so there aren't many 'dry' patches where you play games forever without plot incentive.Cluefinders Software is a great way for your child to review educational skills while having a whole lot of fun. And if you're just looking for a fun game- hey, it's good for that too. I highly recommend it.~RBW"
73544,1,It does require time no method is so easy as not to require some sacrifice on the part of the user. I am learning very fast and am driving my wife and son crazy speaking spanish to them. Put the time into this product and it is worth it
88663,0,"After first installation, numerous 32-bit errors appeared. On my own, since e-mails to McAfee were not answered to satisfaction, I found a patch on their web site which fixed the bug. If you buy this program and have Internet Explorer 5.0 you WILL have to get the patch if version number of First Aid is 6.0. Now--- with the patch the program does perform alright (considering cost). The biggest plus is the crash protector which has gotten me out of a few jams. Although this is OK, you are probably better off spending more for a more comprehensive and more stable program."
68940,1,"PhysicsTutor Excalibur, formatted just like ChemTutor Excalibur, is a must have for students who want an excellent resource for the Physics SAT II and AP tests. This software allows students who are currently studying material to focus in on many major areas of concentration within Physics. By asking series of multiple choice questions, students are able to find out what they have a good understanding of, and more importantly, where they need to spend more time. The ""explain"" and ""learn"" buttons show students how to solve problems, and allows them to see where they are having trouble. Students can choose specific sections to work on as practice and review, but can also set up tests, choosing only the major areas that will be on their next test, to focus in on that information. Because the questions are asked just as they are on the AP and SAT II exam, this program is especially helpful in creating the mode of thinking necessary to do well on these important tests. This is an excellent program for any student who has a passion to excel."
56217,1,"If you're like me, and don't entirely trust the public education system to do its job, then the Elementary Success Deluxe 2006 may be what you're looking for. My children often come home frustrated from a long day at school, and their spirits seem to rise when I uncover this DVD package as they exclaim, ""Time to do some REAL learning!""Though I warn you, this package veers dangerously close to home schooling, so you'll have to restrain yourself lest you give your children negative stigmas associated with the home-schooled-kind."
73675,1,"This is a wonderful game. It is a little challenging, but you'll definitely figure it out. I still enjoy it after months of play. There is also a special restaurant that awaits you at the end of the 49th level. I also recommend you get Diner Dash 2, you should defintely get the two games together deal. Both of them are fun, but definitly master the first before moving on to the second. Overall, have and fun and enjoy this HIGHLY recommended game."

53348,1,"I think BigOven is a great program for storing and sorting all my favorite recipes. It lives up to its claims.I also read the review of BigOven that wanted shopping lists and menus all ready for shopping, and I think the program they are looking for can be found at savingdinner.com. They send out 6 dinner recipes, along with a corresponding categorized shopping list. One Menu Mailer even gives you all that plus Breakfast, Snacks and Lunch, called the Body Clutter Menu Mailer. You can also find a book at your library or here on Amazon called Saving Dinner, and it's the same thing, and you can even print the shopping lists from online as well.Should you decide to do Menu Mailer, please tell them that I sent you. My email address is flymommy@gmail.com.I hope you find this helpful. Good luck in the kitchen!"
20692,0,"This software isn't very good unless your going to actually sit down and memorize hundreds of phrases. No sentance structure is given so, unless you have a book on Japanese grammer, you wont actually know how to change one of the sentances to better suit a situation you might be in.Also, this software didn't go into the Japanese writing systems (Kanji, Katakana and Hiragana) except in a chart of the kana sounds and a few signs that you'll see around Japan. Other than that, the whole things was written in Romanji. You can learn to talk from this but then you'll have to go and learn all over again if you ever want to actually write or read any Japanese.The additional features are ok, though not the best. This also comes with a Bonuc CD which had GrammerPro! and Unitype Global Writer. Unitype Global Write is, in my opinion, a great idea. But, sadly, it constantly has problems and needs to be re-loaded to the computer. (Which it never wants to do because the CD doesn't, and never did, work quite properly.So, before you resort to buying this CD, I suggest you look around for some other software or a good book. If you do resort to buying this CD, try to find it on eBay or somewhere cheaper, as it isn't worth my fifty bucks."
69353,2,"I worked with the customer service reps at Microsoft for days (phone calls lasting hours) to finally reach the conclusion that there were too many bugs in this software to allow it to function properly. I ended up returning it, very dissatisfied. My advice - do not buy this product! It wasted so much of my time."
74701,1,"I like this game a lot, but it sometimes has problems. Also I think that it should have more tracks. It only has 6 tracks. 1.kitchen/living room 2.kid's room 3.greenhouse 4.garage 5.sandbox and 6.game room. And they all have different music when you click on the picture of the track in the track selection. I like the fastest car: ""way 2 fast"". You should get this game if you like to rebuild computers. The game messes up other programs after a while. I have loaded this software on 3 different computers (windows based o/s) and it worked fine for the first few days. after that, when i would start the game, I would select a track, then I would hear repeating 4-second segment music chunks. The next problem is the color. The color gets messed up. Half of a second it is normal, then the other half of the second my mom says it looks like the polarization feature on a digital camera. A bigger problem is in the tournament when you get to the sandbox track the whole game freezes up. I hit ctrl+alt+del and esc a few times and the windows task manager pops up and has messed up colors too. Then I would end the game and the colors are back to normal. The biggest problem is, over time, the game program messed other programs up and then over more time, the computer became so messed up, my dad had to rebuild it. i really like this game but i didn't want so many bugs. :-("
70378,1,This program so far has been great. I teach piano lessons and my students really enjoy it. They really feel like it has been helping them learn along with my lessons. I would recommend this product to anyone.
53955,0,"The program is put together well and it is fun to use. However, when it said it was for beginners, it wasn't kidding. I didn't know that there would be so few words on it. I don't think I'll even be able to say an entire sentence. This is a great product if you want to learn the basics before you go on vacation, but it is not a good product if you truly want to become fluent in Swahili."

Now outdated, they are often ignored in favor of google or some other internet map source.I liked the Geographic ones for their overlapping of quad sections, so that prints could be more nicely managed. Also, when scanning, they simply moved in any direction without edges. All TOPO does not do that. To move from one topo map to an adjacent one you mark the spot on the next map and it will bring up that map at that mark. They can't be blended, therefore inconveniences arise in viewing and printing."
6267,1,"Hey, I know it is really trendy to bust Microsoft's chops, but I really must give credit where credit is due. I have looked at all the major office suites for Mac and Windows, and this really raises the bar - sets a new standard. The new features are really impressive, and the user interface is vastly improved. I am writing this for the upgrade version because I have just installed this over my well-worn Office X. Here are a few random thoughts after a few hours of playing with it:a) Installation is well thought-out. The installer looks for prior identities and moves them to O-2004. Address books, old mail, calanders, preferences are all set up with the first boot.b) Tool windows are now translucent, which adds real appeal to the user interface.c) Repetative items, such as making labels, envelopes, and proofing tools are much more intuitive.d) MS did their homework on the notebook feature. OK, they borrowed the idea from NoteTaker, but what NT does well, MSO-2004 does one better. I wish I had this when I was in Medical School. Drag and drop links, pictures movies, outline notes, insert references. I could go on.e) I have not tried EndNote or ChemDraw with it. These are make it or break it applications for me. I suspcet they will work ok because the tools section works the same way.f) I confess that I liked the last version of MSO for Windows, which I run on the solitary Windows machine at home. MSO-2004 is so much fun, so intuitive and so clean that I now have no reason whatsoever to run Windows.Every time I break down in a moment of weakness and consider succumbing to pressure to abandon my beloved Mac, something comes along to bring me to my senses, and remain loyal to these wonderful machines, really appreciating how wonderful the Mac really is. MSO-2004 is such an application; I am sure I will win a few converts when their quizzical looks turn to avarice."

The ribbon groups make it fast and easy to locate what you are looking for. The newer applications (OneNote, Groove & InfoPath) enhance productivity and help the user prepare documents for sharing via Microsoft SharePoint Services.

Firstly, in the light of the first review, above -- we too thought that we had a defective copy because we couldn't get past the first stage and couldn't find all the objects. However, the key to success is that rather than ""giving"" the help-objects to Arthur to carry out tasks with, you have to ""give"" them to the thing you're trying to get. Once you've figured this out, it becomes much more straightforward to progress.Second point is that this game also goes under the name of Arthur's Wilderness adventure, so, Arthur fans, don't accidentally buy the same game twice!I think this is an unusually creative and imaginative game for young kids and would recommend it."

36011,1,"Just a word of caution - if you're planning on using the Audio Conversion section of the Microsoft Plus Digital Media Editon to convert WMA files to MP3 files, this won't work out of the box if you have WMP10 on your system (you will get an error noting an ""incompatible codec""). This is a known issue with Microsoft and they have a patch that you need to download from them. It's a small, simple patch to download and install (but you have to look for it - hint: enter the error message you get into the MKB Search) and everything works fine after you install it. Other than that it's a good program, although I agree with the other reviewers that, for the most part, this is a collection of enhancements that should have already been included with XP."

56180,1,"Okay, i didn't want to buy a logo software, since I already had Paint Shop Pro 8.0 and my plain but-trusty Microsoft Paint Program, which I use for all graphics needs. So I decided to put my own art skills and creativity to the test using graphics programs to create my logo, instead hiring somebody to do it for me (spending a ton of money and I might even like it as much as if i do it myself!).I was able to put together a few logo ideas with those graphic programs of mine, but it TOOK SO LONG, it WAS NOT POLISHED AND CLEAN, I WISH THERE WERE LOGO-LIKE TEMPLATES. I bought a few cheaper logo softwares (under $50 range), and this software was the best out of all of them.I would not call this a 99 cent type of logo software. There's far worse than this. The good points about this one compared to other crappier software IMO:- Sharp looking templates- Templates offer a wide variety of colors- Templates do not look cheap and drawn out, or way too flashyMind you, I was going for a ""large corporation look"", rather than a cheap, low-budget, internet start-up look. So this program really had the style to accomplish this objective of mine.(The other software had a lot of flashy templates, where you could create logos for perhaps a bar or nightclub down the street, not for a professional company that would to be respected by serious clients.)As far as a software to help me brainstorm ideas, and easily put together and test out a wide range of colors and shapes, that come out looking clean, sharp, and refined...the software really eased my ability to do so. The other graphics programs (however good for pictures and drawings and other applications), were not designed specifically or making logos... thus they took a lot longer and ended up being less clean and polished than what this logo software could produce in a lot less time.I'm glad I shelled out the $30 i did to help me develop my very own logo with my own mind and bare hands. If you care about your company, but still are on a budget, and want something that will pop out prospective logos easily (and let you tweak all your ideas easily) this would be worth the $30."

Many states have *no* coverage. And coverage is limited to (at most)50 items per category. So even for major cities it lists only 50 hotels, 50 restaurants, etc, and many times far less. The SD card is 128mb, but only 20mb is used for data! You can copy the data from the SD card to the GPS, and there is no activation code, so the data isn't locked to a single GPS.Most expensive 20MB of data I ever bought."

Well, it turns out the train's name is not Nancy. The person playing the game becomes Nancy Drew and that might be a problem for some males. If you don't like being called Nancy, then I wouldn't recommend this game for you. I started thinking about this and it can't be good for sales since the game only caters to half the population (plus guys who don't mind being called Nancy, which I don't think is very common). So if you're ready to become Nancy, slap on those heels and get ready for a wild and mysterious train ride through the land of secrets and Toronto."

35727,1,"As a technology teacher in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY, I'm always looking for ways to expose my students to new and exciting software. Fluenz Mandarin has been the perfect teaching tool.I'm able to keep 28 students focused, engaged, and learning despite only having one copy of this software - I use my laptop and project it to the overhead screen. Fluenz Mandarin has been a great way to keep the kids learning when we have a few extra minutes left at the end of the period.I have one particular student who has had many struggles; she's been in and out of prison all year and has flunked all her classes for the last two years -- a shame because she is extremely intelligent and creative. When I introduced Fluenz Mandarin to her, she embraced it completely. The lessons move at a great pace, they challenge but don't frustrate or overwhelm, and they kept her motivated. No teacher has been able to harness her interest in the way this program does. While this student doesn't have a great attendance record, when she isn't absent she comes to my computer lab everyday after school to practice for 30-45 minutes. Every so often she'll burst through the door, beaming, and say ""Guess what? I had a conversation with the delivery guy from the Chinese restaurant on Irving and Putnam."" This program has done wonders for her self esteem. It might seem silly but my hope is that Fluenz Mandarin will save her from the streets.Obviously I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning Mandarin but even more I would encourage teachers and school administrators to invest in this software. It will make a difference."
66037,1,"This program is incredible! I've always needed some type of outside motivator for my workouts (a person that is expecting me to show up, or a class I'm required to attend), and Yourself! Fitness is the perfect version of that. You start off by doing a block of fitness tests to see where you are with different types of physicality (for example: flexibility, heartrate before and during exertion, etc.). After that each and every workout is tailor-made for you - you tell your new fitness instructor whether a certain section of a workout was too hard, just right, or too easy, and she makes note of that and changes the intensity/difficulty of that section for the next workout. You get to choose a workout focus as well, which is great, seeing that we're all looking for something a little different! For example, I know that it isn't good to target the same muscles in workouts on consecutive days, so I pick a few that I rotate between (core strength, weight-loss, and cardio), and therefore have so much variety (she changes the moves for each workout, as well as gives you the option of different environments for you to watch her perform these exercises in. There are also meal-plans and a meditation option where you spend time doing yoga/pilates moves while she is doing the same in a garden and water setting. I love how she cheers you on, it really doesn't seem to matter that I know she can't see me, because the program is, after all, asking me quite often how things feel for me and how motivated I am. I HIGHLY reccommend this for every level of exercise ability. It's just so fun, too!"

71750,1,"The entire game focuses on the idea of stealth. You cant just go running with phasers firing at random. The away team is an ELITE away team who use lastest starfleet technology to enter into missions with the maxmium stealth. You can use phaser, phaser rifles, sniper rifle, grenades and plenty of special tools to do a stealth operation. This is not a shot'em up game, its a stealth game. You cant just go into a mission and shot the enemy because in some missions, that will cuz a mission failed. In one level, you cant even be seen by any guards. So buy this game and think of ways not to be seen by guards and sneak around corners. There is no beginners level to this game, however first 3 are easy enough to get your stealth up. Buy the game and prepare for stealth operations."

The same applies to the effects although the configuration is not particularly flexible. And there are always things you miss like a multi-head tape machine such as a Meazzi in order to produce those wonderful ""Shadows"" echoes.

In the spelling disk, you catch falling fish with the correctly spelled word on them, click zooming crabs with the letter that fills in the blank in the word you are spelling, and play a sort of racing game that I'm not sure you can lose.One of the best parts is that you can put your own math problems and spelling word into the game. However you must also put incorrect spellings of the word you put in.Math: Fun: B+,-on the higher side.Education: A+ -Terrific, and you can put in your own problems.Music: C -Err... it's fine.

45748,1,"I started using Suse 9.0 Pro as soon as it came out. All I can say is I absolutely love it. I use it at home and work for my desktops.I see other reviews here saying it deleted my hard drive and other various things like it does not support NTFS etc. Well of course it doesn't support NTFS its not Windows and since MS has not released the NTFS specs how does anyone expect someone to decipher a convoluted file system like NTFS without any help? You have many file systems to choose from which are designed so that they don't need to be defragmented.As for the people saying it deleted my hard drive. Was it Linux that changed your partition table by it's self or did you tell it to do it and didn't realize what you did? If you were going from Linux to Windows would there be a chance of you wiping your Linux partitions?People that bought Suse Linux and complained that it's not Windows should have downloaded the evaluation version from the Suse website first. Then they would know it wasn't Windows and would not need to buy two operating systems. It's there, it's free, download it first. Where is the Windows demo?Suse provides a nice Linux distribution with good configuration tools but Linux is not for everyone. (At least not yet.) Linux will do just about anything you want it to but you have to know how to drive it. Windows is easy to drive but won't do nearly as much."
19447,1,"Borland C++ builder, makes coding easy.Let me explain. You have a simple console program. You have transferred your concept from paper to a program. The C++ Buider has console project that you can create, to slot your .cpp file in, and then compile. Easy!But you ask: 'What if I want to create a GUI that goes with the program?Choosing a project with SDI (Single document Interface) or MDI (Multiple document interface) does not cause your simple concept in the .cpp program to get lost in all that code that was generated in creating that GUI, which can work as a MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class) Project. (Again a project type within Borland C++ Builder sets that up).The GUI in the SDI or MDI package is pre-build, and shows only the code that will modify the way the software you develop behaves and runs, and avoids showing all the internal files, if you are happy with them as they are. This means that you only have to debug your own code and the limited amount of code you modified !Where can I go with Borland C++ Builder as supposed to Visual Basic. NET or Visual C++ .Net ?Borland C++ Builder combines the user friendliness of Visual Basic.Net with the power of Visual C++ .Net language. Like in Visual Basic.Net WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), but C++ gives you the scope to make programs in the oldest and main developer language around. C++ builder also opens up the scope of creating applications in C++ that are not platform dependant, with the additional feature of making C applications, .dll files and Database driven applications, without generating much code to begin with. Happy Programming !In addition Borland C++ Builder can be linked together with another persons C++ builder license and the program can be pooled and simultaneously debugged, compared to say Visual .Net packages, giving you a faster time to market, and makes it far easier to work to some sort of deadline.Borland C++ Builder has stood the test of time. Its GUI's are fully integrated with any windows Operating System while it connects to all major Data vendors such as Oracle, Sql Server, MS Access, Informix, Sybase etc... .If you are not short of resources, you can upgrade to an Enterprise Version of C++ Builder, which allows you to jump between Borland C++ Builder and Visual C++, (a more integrated approach to Windows Programming)."

It protects and mostly stays out of your way once you've told it what applications should have access.

I've used it for over a year now - I don't recall ever it hogging up/freezing my machine. It has done a terrific job quaranting potential viruses I've seen in email attachments as well as preventing software I don't want to allow from accessing the internet - and it integrates with most email software, including thunderbird. Lastly, it has a nice quick ""Stop all Internet activity"" feature for those that don't wish to shut down the machine and want to prevent any and all traffic in/out while away."

86710,1,"I never expected this product to work this well. to demonstrate how well it works,I will dictate this review into the box, and make no corrections. Welder products required that you separate the words with pauses in between. This one does not. In fact, it works better if you dictate an entire sentence continuously, with no pauses. I believe the reason this works better is that it allows the program to analyze the syntax and semantics of what you are saying, and thus improve the quality of the results.As an engineer who worked briefly in the 60s on speech recognition, I am really impressed."
60783,1,"I had read a lot of reviews (here and elsewhere) warning of Final Cut's massive learning curve, and I do believe that helped soften the blow when I first tried this program. Because there definitely is a learning curve--this is far more complex than iMovie. But, the good news is, it's not beyond the newbie's reach!I'm such a newbie with anything video, it's pitiful. I have only made two or three small movies in iMovie, and they weren't very sophisticated. I mostly just tinkered around. But, being the fool that I am, I decided that I wanted to get Final Cut Express to go along with the new camcorder I had just purchased.Because I was prepared to have to re-learn (or struggle) at first with Final Cut, I had purchased a book (for version 2 of FCE, which was perfectly suitable). Armed with my book and limited expectations, I set about trying to make a fun little ""music video"" (using video clips and still pictures). Amazingly enough, I learned how to do the ""Ken Burns Effect"" with the pictures, make transitions from one clip to the next, edit the sound so that one track would predominate for part of the video, then fade out for other parts. And I was able to fix the video clips (zoom in, lighten, change aspect ratio). And then I added titles with LiveText. All this in the first two days of using Final Cut! Sure, the little video I made was no award-winner, but it was actually a servicable, fun little project that I wasn't too ashamed to show my friends.(Another thing about fixing the aspect ratio of one of the video clips--there was this one clip that seemed resistent to any tweaking or adjusting that I tried with it. I had used multiple programs to try to resize it to the correct dimensions, but something always went wrong. Either the picture quality degraded terribly, or else the corrected dimensions didn't ""stick"" and it bounced back to being distorted. Nothing worked--until Final Cut. I'm sure that other programs could have done the same thing, but I tried so many, and failed. So that was another thing that impressed me!)I know there's a whole lot more to learn about Final Cut, and I certainly don't anticipate that I'll become a master at it. But it does offer *a lot* more flexibility than iMovie, and it is definitely a lot of fun.The right way to approach it is, I believe, to start small, expect baby steps at first, have fun, and GET A BOOK! A book is absolutely essential. If you are an impatient soul who expects perfection the first day, this is not the application for you. Because you learn to ""do it manually,"" you have much more control--but it takes time to learn it all.Oh, a note about hardware: I made my first little video on a 1.25 GHz G4 Mac Mini with 512 megs of RAM. It wasn't a speed demon by any means, but because my video was short (about 2 minutes), it really wasn't too painfully slow most of the time (except for rendering, but I guess that was going to be slow anyway). I have since upgraded the Mini to 1 GB of RAM, and *everything* is snappier, so I highly recommend it. But it's good to know that even a little Mac Mini with less-than-impressive RAM can work in FCE."
52925,0,"This is a preliminary review of the new updated ShopnCook 4.0 recently released. I had already purchased the previous 3.4 version a while back and figured most of it out with some pain but it did what I needed. With the new release and the cost of an upgrade being around $40 US I thought I should review some other programs to see if there was anything better out there. While this has been a long while coming there are a few shortcomings that remain from the previous versions. Firstly the layout remains un'Mac' like. Other programs such as MacGoumet Deluxe 3.03 or Cookware Deluxe 4.2 which were rated by toptenreviews.com in the 2011 review as the 1 & 2 products for Mac have far more visual appeal. Shopncook Menu 3.4 (old version reviewed by them at present) was considered by the reviewers at toptenreviews as being too expensive for what it offered. I agree with that as even the new version still relatively awkward and clunky in parts and there is not that much extra to get excited about. Another negative feature of Shopncook Menu 4.0 is that the file sharing arrangement is limited by the format the files are saved in. That means that if you put a lot of time and effort into putting recipes in Shopncook Menu you wont easily be able to transfer them to another program should you find something better later. Other programs such as MacGoumet Deluxe will allow you to share or transfer your recipes more easily as they offer more file conversion tools. Navigating the Shopncook Menu program is also not as intuitive as say MacGourmet and to a lesser extent Cookware Deluxe. However what the Shopncook Menu 4.0 program lacks in style it makes up for if you are looking for the following:1. A program that allows you to import recipes from other sources/websites easily. It does this as do others but it does a quicker less fiddly job of 'parsing' the recipe ingredients into relevant categories with fewer errors than other programs.Finding your way around the recipes is quite easy. For some programs you will need to manually type in some aspects of the recipes and if you have lots of them you have a job ahead of you.2. It has a good menu planner once you figure out how the thing works. It is hard to believe someone can bring out an upgrade without a decent online manual. There is relatively little in the way of a guide to teach you how to use this aspect of the program. You can set it up on a daily, weekly, monthly basis. Get your head around what a menu constitutes and you are on your way to getting this to work for you.3. It gives you a shopping list to purchase your items that while not pretty (terrible layout and fonts) is flexible enough to allow you to easily add and review your shopping lists.Overall if you are prepared to slug it out and figure the program out there is a good set of features in Shopncook Menu 4.0. However if you want to avoid that pain you may find it easier to use MacGourmet Deluxe 3.03 which has a much better support set up including some training videos you can download (from the old version) plus a decent manual to help you navigate the program. I personally found the shopping list a bit confusing in MacGourmet... Shopncook is better here.At least these two programs are in the ball park so far as useful programs go... the others will suit specific purposes but if you want something that does recipes, menus and shopping lists fairly well MacGourmet Deluxe 3.03 is the easiest and the Shopncook 4.0 may be the best for existing users who may find the change to another program not worth the effort or cost involved."

73272,1,"Screenwriter 2000Screenwriter 2000 enables you to create script-documents based on a number of pre-formatted templates, which respond to a set of hotkeys, mostly Tab and Enter, in order to conveniently place text in the appropriate place for screenplays, stage plays, etc. You can also use Screenwriter 2000 as a you would normally use a word processor, since it has spell checking and font formatting features. Custom templates can be created from scratch, or by modifying those installed.The format set-up property sheet / control panel is well thought out, access to all the parameters needed are from that screen, there being no need for jumping from one dialog box to another. The primary interface is usefully uncluttered, and is switchable between standard Microsoft Word view and its own. Not that there's a lot of difference, but it could be a comfort factor if you're used to Word.Import and file save-as options are very comprehensive. But you'll mostly be saving as a SCW file, a PDF for distribution and printing from outside of Screenwriter, and RTF for those who don't have Screenwriter and need an editable draft.Pasting a previously created script with the correct formatting from an RTF will result in Screenwriter applying the correct tags to the copied text, so that you don't need to worry about having to re-do the script in Screenwriter.The only distraction that I encountered was in Dialogue text. In Screenwriter 2000 you have to insert a specific line-break to avoid the enter key splitting the dialogue with the ( more ) and Joe Blow ( cont't ) tags as if you were crossing a page-break. This can be done by going Edit &gt; Add Dialogue Paragraph or using Ctrl+Alt +D. The index cards are directly editable, which might be useful, but you are warned that some of the features used in the main editing window will be lost. Warnings of this type abound, so you're unlikely to do anything disastrous if you heed them.Screenwriter 2000 is a great product for writing scripts which will keep their formatting automatically updated as you proceed, revise, and amend. It should also be borne in mind that Screenwriter 2000 is part of a suite of products, which will allow you cover many aspects of the production process beyond the screenplay."

2305,0,"I am used to Photoshop 6 and purchased this as only 7 was upgradeable. It is just like the old versions except it has redeye reduction which you get in Microsoft Picture it for about $40. The spot healing tool doesnt work very well and areas pop in that you dont want. Sometimes I do not notice any difference between healing and the regular clone tool. The program is good like regular photoshop, but IMO all photoshop programs should only be about $100 not $1000 like the newer ones Cs3 extended. The thing I dislike about this program is the filter tab which brings up a larger edit window and doesnt let you minimize it compared to older versions for side to side comparison ( So you can see both at the same time,while you compare adjustments to the original). I also like the desciptions like Pressure before that they now call Hardness in the tool adjustment settings. I hate all software upgrades basically because they usually change everything instead of leaving it the same and adding to it. I was hoping this had new filters, but it had about the same amount and had alot of useless filters instead of more painting filters. I also like Picture it, because you can select a file and grab it and move it all around and set it on to another picture and stretch it up down and sideways without having to go through a lot of steps like photoshop. Photoshop does alot of other things that other programs cant do and the image warp and vanishing point make this a good upgrade. The learning curve is steep because the program goes through alot of steps that other programs like picture it do easily and quickly. I got this cheaper since it is the older program compared to CS3 extended which like I said is way over priced. Next is CS4 which will only work with 64 bit Vista and not the current 32 bit Vista and will be very expensive and I wont ever get it. Adobe will take a dive on this one and it will cost at least $1000 plus. Its pretty sad that after 9 editions that they had auto redeye correction when picture it had it long ago. This alone justifies the fact that Photoshop is full of itself and way over priced. Still Photoshop is a good program to have but it tells you how to make picture borders for instance while other programs have picture borders in their program and you can easily select from a multitude of different ones. Conclusion a necessary but hard program with a step learning curve that is way over priced for what it does. CS2 and Cs3 extended upgrade for 3D may be worth having after prices go down instead of the CS4 64bit pogram that wont work on most Vista operating systems. I basically use Photoshop for Cloning and Vanishing point and Image Warp and Picture it and MGI photosuite for Borders, colors, frames and manipulation of objects."
19881,1,"This is the most challenging ND game I have played! I finished it, but I actually started over three seperate times because despite my fervent note taking, and the checklist on Nancy's laptop, I was still coming up short on clues! I did eventually solve the case and as usual, it's always the person you least expect. The plot line was so twisted and the gameplay was so long and winding that I was beginning to think that I would never get to the end. There are so many seperate parts of this game that depend solely on what you've done beforehand. I enjoyed this because it took me so long to solve and the extent of thinking I had to put into it just to get to the end, and the ending itself was a surprise too."

17697,1,"I've installed this software on three computers, and only had one problem, that was promptly resolved through Tech support and involved a quick fix. I'm running this on various XP and 98SE systems. SystemSuite uses a whole lot less resources than Symantec Systemworks and Personal Firewall so your computer will run faster. I have had serious problems with Symantec products, especially if you own them more than a year or so, and pay for the annual update. Symantec seems to abandon software updates and support for older versions of its products. And forget about trying to call someone at Symantec unless you want to pay more. I have had no problem running Systemsuite with AOL either. The utilities included in Systemsuite are better and more numerous than SystemWorks, especially the Registry Fixer. I'm recommending to my friends to ditch Symantec and go with Systemsuite. Unfortunately, many of them are creatures of habit, something Symantec relies on. Also, if I'm reading V-com's policy correctly, there is no time limit on antivirus/firewall updates, at least not until the new version comes out when they they say they may implement a one-year limit on updates. The firewall is supplied by Sygate, and the antivirus program is supplied by Trend Micro, both top rate vendors in each software category. According to a PC World article, version 6 is due out soon."
15579,0,"This is the third internet security suite I've used and it's just OK, maybe a bit better than others. Has not bogged down my computers as Norton tends to do and does a much more thorough job scanning and detecting intruders. I do like the speed of Panda's automatic updates - hardly know it's happening till it's finished. Gives nice reports and summaries of threats. Has settings for only scanning application I actually use. Has some annoying pop-ups and it took 4 attempts to fully load. Does not seem to interfere with or delete other programs as some reviewers have mentioned. Appears to be doing a decent job but I would like to see it run faster."
15912,0,"I am interested in this life/time management software after attending a 3-day &quot;7-Habits...&quot; workshop. But after 3 days of using it, the bugs begin to surface, few but annoying.Nontheless, I think the software is ahead in principle of other planners around and for this reason I will persevere in using it until there are fixes to the bugs. I would rate this product with 5 stars if the bugs are minor and the support team at Franklin Covey are responsive with their fixes."

All of the Mercer Mayer software, Me and My Mom and Me and My Grandmom plus the books and even movies are terrific. This is a great piece of software to read with your child. Girls will also enjoy it. Highly recommended!"

I tried to find as much information about the product as I could, but unfortunately there were not many reviews available on the internet. So I decided to give it a shot, and 3 months later I can truly say: it's one of the best purchases I've made. Just make sure to order some higher-quality headphones with noise-cancelling microphone since the ones that come included might not be as comfortable and reliable."

NO.however, all families have unique dynamics and ALL FAMILIES come with their own set of unusual circumstances.This film is just once slice of post-modern family life... not every same-sex family life, but one story at least.What i really like is that it is normalizing to the relevant dynamic that affects thousands of persons in this world today whom have been born of an unknown sperm (or egg) donor.also, the performances are excellent."

This is an excellent book for the &quot;beginner&quot;, who wants directions on how to do everything.

3793,0,"I have used other digital media software over the last couple of years but am an amateur generally. For the price this package is a great value. However, the scope of the package is also a drawback. This toolbox of media software contains many different items some of which appear to overlap. If you are starting out I'd recommend a more focused approach using a narrower package with better instructional material. For example, if you are starting our with photo organizing and editing get Adobe Elements. When you move on to video get MyDVD for example. A great value is not always a good buy."
12218,0,"I have been a Windows user and lover from when I was nine years old (I am thirteen years old now). Windows '98 has never disappointed me because I used it for simple things. As I progessed into technology, I bought Windows XP.Windows XP has more pros than cons, but the cons are really that terrible. Sure, everyone loves fast, easy-to-understand computers with neat programs.As a review reader, I like to look for cons first, so:- Too many security flaws. Microsoft needs a definate grip on that. XP, so far, has got to be the most worst off when it comes to security. Honestly, the anti-virus programs can barely help now. I'm tired of installing and restarting my computer every time Microsoft has urgent 'upgrades'.- If you're a furious file downloader like me, you're going to need more megabytes. XP tends to lag a bit slower, and after uninstalling and deleting over one hundred somewhat files, it's still slow (using a 256 MB system).- I don't know if it's just me, but it happens so every month; my computer would just automatically restart without warning. Very bad flaw, I have yet to find out why it's even doing this.- Microsoft Word is good, but it's missing something Windows '98/2000 had: better WordArt options and styles (seriously). This is extremely important to me when I wish to do headers for projects.- I've tried installing some Windows '98 computer games onto my computer, but ta-da! It didn't work. Some faulty error messages popped-up instead. I had no trouble installing '95 games on my '98 back then, so why now?As bad as some cons are, I'm not going to recommend Apple or Linux, because Windows, if you don't mind those poor cons, is quite superior with all the new options they give you. I advise considering buyers to wait a while before they purchase a product from Microsoft though... there's a rumour going around of a new Windows version (Windows Longhorn), so hang in there. :)"
31501,1,"If you want to keep your child entertained but at the same time have them learning then this is the way to do it. KidSpeak Spanish taught my child how to speak some basic Spanish through entertaining cartoon characters, games, activites and more. KidSpeak is great for young kids to learn and have fun with. My child found KidSpeak fun time and time again and, not only did he enjoy it, but he learned immensly from it. I highly suggest using KidSpeak for entertaining and educating your child. This has to be one of the best language learning software for children out there."

22951,1,"I bought this program for my new iMac and have been very satisfied. The only thing that disappointed me about this product was that it cannot copy copyright-protected dvds. However, all I had to do was download the free program MacTheRipper and in combination with Popcorn 2 I am able to easily duplicate my whole dvd collection for backup purposes. Other than that it's been good. You don't get a ton of conversion control so I just use Handbrake, another free program. For the purpose I bought this, to copy my homemade dvds, it works flawlessly. Highly reccommended."
96,1,"""Barbie Sparkling Ice Show"" is a fabolous game and can really inspire creativity and imagination, and that's coming from someone whose 13 years old! This game allows you to pick routines, music, costumes, and fun stuff like decorations and ice color and put it all together to make fabolous routines for Barbie, Christie, and Teresa on the five stops of the Sparkling Ice Tour. But once you finish the tour, the fun doesn't end there- you can continue on skaiting cool exhibition shows using all of the details of previous shows.To work the game, you start off by preparing for the first stop of the tour and practice a routine that you pick out of a few selections with the skater you have chosen. You can pick from three levels: easy, intermediate, or hard, and each one provides more challenges than the next. If you skate the routine well and do a good job, you will be able to do all the ""good stuff""- choosing your music, costume, decorations, etc. for the tour. The game continues on like this for different tour stops such as Rose Garden and Island Paradise, with your goal to make it to the secret surprise location where you can even create your own routine.I found this game to be a lot of fun and not at all boring. Granted, it may be a little bit too easy to get through all the tour stops, but the fun doesn't stop since you can create a user name and start all over again or continue doing skating exhibitions. It is a fabolous game for all figure-skating and Barbie fans, not to mention that it is so much fun! Anyone ages 5 and up will enjoy this wonderful game."

10387,1,"I had to respond. One of the previous reviews is incorrect. It states &quot;but if you get a more involved probe, like a SubSeven probe, BlackIce Defender doesn't block it. Instead, it lets the probe happen, then tells you that someone was looking for something but couldn't find it.&quot; That's not true. If you set BlackIce to &quot;Cautious&quot; or above, it does it's job and blocks just fine. If you leave the protection level set for &quot;Trusting&quot;, you're going to manually have to do what BlackIce does quite nicely automatically. If you don't like all the blinking notices it gives while it's running, just exit the client piece, the daemon still runs and does it's job."
4134,1,"I saw the Jaguar beta demoed at the Atlanta Mac Users Group and was very impressed. Even in an unfinished state, it seemed to be noticeably faster and included spring-loaded folders (missing since OS 9), improved Sherlock, finder search function, and centralized contact database. I don't think the price is out lof line since Apple has to make money somewhere to stay in business.I haven't been disappointed in OS 10.2. My installation went flawlessly (it idid take awhile - at least 2 hours) and I've had no OS-related problems since. Jaguar is definitely faster, especially booting Classic and opening Classic appliacations.I've been using OS X since last fall and can't remember the last time I've had to reboot due to a system crash/kernel panic. Since I have an iBook 2001 (no fan), I never shut down the computer and instead just put it to sleep. I routinely achieve uptimes of 30 days or more. I only have to restart for the occasional software update, handled flawlessly by the Software Update system preference. By the end of 2002 I would like to be totally weaned off OS 9 although that may be a little optimistic."
57157,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."

85865,1,"Although networking is now built in to many of the current operating systems, Artisoft has continued the LANtastic line with this current release. The product installs on NT, Windows 98 and 95, Windows 3.1 and DOS to provide a single client interface to all operating system versions. The user interface is tight and streamlined and consistent with mappings, shares, and security all managed from a common point. For companies sharing the internet, the Artisoft NET BIOS allows your files to be shared via a different protocol than TCP/IP for additional security. On a 95/98 box, the Net Bios can be routed (not on NT), and it works seamlessly with other ARtisoft products like Xtra Mail, Biz Fax, and I-Share to provide a complete network solution. LANtastic adds speed and perfomance to the 95/98 platforms and a common interface to NT."

This game has greatly improved my skill and I love that I can increase the skill level as needed. I also like that I do not have to have anyone else to play with, but can just play against the computer. When I do play with other people now it is so much nicer playing on the computer - you never have to worry about missing tiles or cleaning up the tiles after you are finished.

33249,1,"Interesting to see all the whining about various things and user threatening to go use Windows. Go ahead. Deal with the Microsoft nonsense, the nonstop security updates and the constant virus updates for my virus scanner. I just bought an ibook with OS X 10.2 installed in it and I love it. I am a NT/2000 Systems Administrator and I have 2 Windows XP machines at home but I thoroughly enjoy using OS X. I use it exclusively to do work at home leaving my XP machines to be expensive doorstops. I recommend that users buy one of the OSX books that list the hidden features/recommended settings to get full functionality of the OS. We NT/2000/XP user's have to buy these books also because nothing in Windows is documented and Microsoft has everything turned on in it's OSs at install so everything (including security) is wide open which is bad because a lot of applications/services that ordinary home users have no need for is hogging a lot of memory. Although I must admit paying so much to upgrade to Panther when it comes out is something that I am not looking forward to."

63317,1,"Reason 2.5 is the most intuitive music composition software available, particularly due to the fact that it emulates music hardware rather than work like software. Those who are familiar with such hardware will recognize many of the tools: mixer, samplers, synths, drum machine, and effects devices. You can organize these devices on a virtual rack. Press the Tab key and it flips to the back of the rack, showing all the inputs/outputs, gates and cables, as if you were looking at the back of actual hardware. Simply amazing.When one can buy Reason for less than $400, it's hard to justify the hardware route costing perhaps ten grand (FYI: an even better bargain is the Reason 2.5 / M-Audio Ozone keyboard package for around $430). In other words, the program is tremendous value for money, and combined with Pro Tools, has the potential to produce professional-quality sound. Furthermore, Reason allows the user to focus on making music, rather than wasting time moving around hardware and physically reconnecting them. You can test various ideas quickly (e.g. try out different effects) since you can hook up devices without leaving your seat.Reason also has a great sequencer, which logically converts the temporal nature of music into visual, spatial data. The sequencer should therefore be readily accessible for people who have basic experience with graphics software (e.g. Illustrator, CAD) and easy to learn for those who don't.The one thing you can't do with Reason is take samples/loops from existing songs. For instance, I can't lift a section off a Metallica guitar solo or Mozart string quartet or whatever and create a new pattern from that. To do this, you need ReCycle, another software product from Propellerhead.The manual that comes with the software isn't great, but it's enough to get you started and overcome the not-so-steep learning curve to start making songs. Actually, this is the first of a few learning curves and down the road one should invest in a real manual to help refine the sound. As Reason has so many possibilities, it's best to concentrate on the song and sounds you want to make rather than get bogged down by the endless combinations of devices and control settings. After all, you probably wouldn't be considering this product if you didn't have a few specific musical ideas stuck in your head."

16967,1,"This is a great program to help keep your computer running smoothly. I've used this program for a while at home and it is a must-have at the office. The only problems was getting the download link from this site sent to me in a timely fashion. It took around 24 hours to get it; not the 30 minutes as suggested. And though thats not really a problem, most of us like to get what we paid for quickly. Specially on the internet, when it should be processed and sent fairly quickly. Other than that, it's an excellent program to find all sorts of problems with windows small and large. I SUGGEST using the system check first, then the optimizing wizard which will be followed by the speed disk automatically upon restarting. These 3 things are the most useful of this product. doing this will speed up the process alot quicker than not using optimization wizard. cheers, mate."

When the trail Period ran out I was going to renew the Norton but the cost of renewing it was quite expensive so I looked into other Anti-viruses.With Norton it Glitches with a lot of software you run on your computer (ie; Sims).PC-cillin works great, it is very user friendly and you don't need to be Bill Gates to figure it out.I have had no problems running other software with PC-cillin.Also bare in mind that with Norton Anti-Virus you don't get the Firewall with it you have to pay for higher version.Overall I would recommend the PC-cillin over Norton.The only down side to PC-cillin it seems to update every five minutes and it can get annoying if you are running other software at the same time."
29484,1,"I don't have much use for anything in the suite except WordPerfect. I've been using WordPerfect since before Windows, when, if you were lucky enough to afford a 4 color screen, the word processor could display a blue or a green background, displayed ASCII characters, there were no fonts except Courier, and laser printers cost a small fortune. I work for a number of attorneys -- WordPerfect is the software of choice for wordprocessing in most offices I've worked in because, in my opinion, it is the better product for the job. It has many features specifically designed for law office use incuding the pleading macro, a toolbar for legal work, and tables of authorities and table of contents designed for legal documents. It may also be because WordPerfect has been around for so long that everyone just migrated without changing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!When WordPerfect came out, it took over the market. When MicroSoft came out with Word, I had the feeling they did everything they could to make it different from WordPerfect just to use its power in the industry to take over the wordprocessing market, just like MicroSoft did with every other good software idea to come along. (e.g., Mozilla/Netscape, Norton Utilities.) I hate Microsoft's stupid animated paperclip -- it makes me feel like a 7 year old. ""It looks like your writing a letter ..."" Go away! It was amusing to watch it roll itself up and spit itself through some imaginary pinch rollers when you print a document, but only once. By the fourth time that stupid paperclip reared its animated eyeballs and interfered with my workflow, I wanted to tell MicroSoft to wrap that annoying the paperclip around their cable modems!! I'm an adult!I have two versions of Word and WordPerfect 5, 7, 8, 10 and 12. (I just threw out 5.2 for Windows and 7 when I moved.) I use the MicroSoft product only when absolutely necessary -- usually because someone else needs the document in that format.In my experience, Word does one thing better than WordPerfect -- and it is a biggie -- it works with HTML documents better than the Corel WordPerfect. With Word, you can copy an entire page from the Web and paste it directly into Word and it will pull most of the pictures from the Web. WordPerfect does not go and get the pictures. HEAR THAT COREL!?! However, I don't often copy entire web pages into my documents.The reason I like WordPerfect so much is that it types more like a typewriter. You can set up and use styles if you want, but you can also just hit the tab button to indent the first line of a paragraph. If you want to change the margins for the entire document, you simply change the margins. The rest of the document follows the change. You don't have to change each paragraph.In addition, you can get to the formatting codes. Hit Alt-F3 and the screen splits in half and displays all of the formatting codes -- bold, underline, tabs, indent codes, line spacing, column on and off, etc. Then you know exactly what you have done and fix and format it easily. This ability has proven useful on several occasions when clients, who insist on using Word for legal documents, cannot cajole Word to put their unruly documents into the format they want. (This is particularly true when using OCR with scanned or faxed documents.) By opening the Word document in WordPerfect, I have been able to use ""Alt-F3"" to identify the errant codes and quickly repair them. The ability to easily replace formatting codes becomes extremely powerful when combined with global search and replace commands. WordPerfect can then save the document in Word/RTF format with the problems fixed.Working with columns is also easier. You turn on columns and tell it how many colums you want, set the width of each, and the space between them, and away you go. You have four types of columns to work with -- newspaper, balanced newspaper, parallel and parallel with block protect. It handles columns much better. I've tried the other software, and if you change text or printers, you can never get the columns to line up the way you want it. With Word, each colum change or page change seems to introduce new control codes, and a complete set of formatting, and you can never get it back the way you want it. I once tried to scan in a list of names and addresses which were in two or three columns into Word. Each name and address was placed in its own text box. I could never work with it.The most prominent change between WP 10 and 12 is the workspace manager which allows you to switch between legal mode, original (classic) WordPerfect 5.1 mode (with the blue screen), legal mode, standard WordPerfect for Windows mode and Word mode. They have also included the ability to publish to Adobe PDF, HTML, and RTF/Word formats.This is full featured software, and does everything I need. It handles tables, tables of content, tables of authorities, column sorts -- everything I need in a law office. Graphics can be dropped in with a click of the mouse. I'm considered to be almost an expert, and there is a lot I don't know!Take time to get to know the software and you'll be glad you purchased it."
6545,1,"The traditional family drama gets a provocative twist in this year's preeminent romantic dramedy The Kids Are All Right. Oscar nominees Julianne Moore and Annette Bening star as a gay married couple with two kids trying to battle the throes of their relationship when their kids decide to get curious about their biological father.Jules and Nic (played by Moore and Bening, respectively) are slowly drifting into their own marriage hell when the lethal mix of emotional distance, Nic's dominance and Jules's submissiveness rear their ugly heads. Then their children Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson) decide to seek out their Dad out of sheer curiosity during Joni's last month at home before she heads to college. The distance between their parents grows even further when the mere addition of the cool, motorcycle-riding dad Paul (played by Mark Ruffalo) threatens to disrupt their tight family unit. The impact Paul has on the family causes Nic to suspect that he may be causing her family to crumble like a stack of cards. But, like in any family drama. what doesn't kill them makes them stronger in the end.Moore and Bening shine in this poignant film with Moore nailing her signature performance of a woman holding on to her last string of hope and Bening letting her fear of losing her family dictate her actions. Together the performances mark the perfect recipe in a beautifully written story is both funny in the most surprising parts and touching when it needs to be."

15776,1,"I am a new writer and have found Final Draft to be all and more than I could have asked for. Initially I feared that the learning curve of the using of the software may be too steep, but in using it soon found out that it was not nearly as complicated as I had thought. The software truly raises the ability that you have to one that is professional and allows you to focus on the story instead of format. It has been a blessing to use this software and I highly recommend it."
16914,1,"I was on the beta test for this program. This product blows away every other consumer product I have ever seen. Don't even bother with any of those other cheaper products, it's just not worth the trouble. It's like comparing a Geo to a Hummer. There is no comparison!"
87593,1,"I was a little put off by several of the other reviews listed here, but decided to take a chance and buy it anyway since I really needed the business side of the software and have been using Money 98 for several years already. The only thing that I can imagine is that the people who didn't like the software were just overwhelmed by the sheer number of new features - most of which are accessible from the front page.Installation was very smooth, as was the conversion of my old Money file. I actually find the front page quite handy and have kept Money open all the time for the last few days so that I can play around with the options there whenever I get a spare moment or two. The software is set up to help you become proactive in terms of your finances and take control. If all you want is a checkbook register, I understand you can turn off alot of the extra features, but if you do that I think you're under utilizing the software.The only drawback I see about the business side of things is that there's not a whole lot of documentation. The options are pretty straightforward though, for anyone with even a slight exposure to business concepts (like invoicing, accounts receivable, etc.). I've quite enjoyed setting up customer accounts and am finding the software a motivator to try and improve my business just so I can play around with the features even more."
44756,1,"My wife and I were going to Europe, and having little knowledge or the languages, we bought the Garmin City Navigator for Europe. I must say, it was a godsend!!!

27541,0,"I am a HUGE Nancy Drew fan :) For Christmas (which is in 10 days!) I am asking for an iPad, camera and all the Nancy Drew games!!! So far I have played five : Secrets Can Kill Remastered, Danger by Design, Trail of the Twister, Secrets of the Scarlet Hand, The Final Scene and currently I'm playing Treasure in a Royal Tower. This game disappointed me. The setting was really nice, but the whole thing just didn't get my attention for some reason. I will admit that if I never played any other Nancy Drew games before I would love this game, but since I have I guess I have higher expectations and others to compare it to. The game was relatively short, but I was more excited to get onto the next Nancy Drew I have. So yea the game was ok, the characters were ok, and I can honestly say I did not expect who the kidnapper was. So if you are going to buy a Nancy Drew game so far out of the ones I played I would recommend Secrets of the Scarlet Hand, that was amazing!!!!! Merry Christmas everyone!So far I've:Learned that Secrets Can KillWas in immediate Danger by DesignWas in the Trail of the TwisterFound the Secrets of the Scarlet HandSaw the Final Scene&lt;3"
39572,1,"Ok, I'll admit, the only reason I bought this game was because I played the sequel. But that doesn't change my feelings about this game, this game rocks, and it blew its sequel away. This game is an adventure/action game, and it goes together very well. And, since you die so easily in the game, you spend more time running through the areas and attacking at the same time, making it feel like a movie, the camera angles shift when someone talks, adding more to the cinematic experience. This game is almost unbeatable in the FPS genre, if you don't get it, you miss out on a bunch of great stuff games have ever done. (Oh and, if you read the review up above somewhere that gave this game two stars, pretend it never existed, because I think the person who did it is video game illiterate.)"
23664,1,This software worked perfectly fine on my computer and prepped me for my Business classes.
21494,0,"OK. This series is definitely not for beginners. I am very skeptical of any program that hypes the ""total immersion"" approach and this ""instant immersion"" takes that to the nth degree. Adults just aren't wired that way. Nor do they have nothing else to do for four or five years except learn a language - - which is what infants do.A lot of time went into putting this series together and it would be a lot more successful if it were sold as a review course in conversational French for intermediate to advanced students. There is very little software available in that area and this package offers a relatively large volume of mid-level practice at a reasonable price.After reading some of the reviews on this page, I figured that out and was not disappointed."
30069,1,"A great product at a great price. I loaded the software on my two desktops and laptop computers upon receipt. I have been using this brand for a number of years, and have more confidence in this computer security software than any other brand."
16694,1,"Until very recently I used the Norton products for my pc's protection (since 1998). After the installation issues I had with the 2005 version (I have WinXP), I tried out McAfee. I was surprised to find out that:(1) The package is very easy and quick to install(2) It's very stable, does not cause any conflicts(3) The options are very simple for the novice user to understand and if an experienced user wishes to delve deeper into its customizations, its as easy as 1, 2 ,3!(4) I tested the product on www.grc.com and on symantec's site, and it came up with the BEST RESULTS!So, if you wish to have a CHEAP, NOT system resources hungry, stable, safe and secure package, look no further, try this one out. I am completely satisfied!"
84869,1,I am very happy with this product. It works great and I was able to easily transfer over my old 2001 files.
22239,1,"This was the second Nancy Drew game I've ever played (first was Secret of the Old Clock) and this one still remains my favorite! Definitely worth $20. I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.PLOT - 5/5: Nancy is invited by socialite Lori Girard to ride West on a historic train in hopes of solving a centuries old mystery. Basically, a rich man named Jake Hurley supposedly left a huge treasure somewhere, only nobody has ever been able to put together all of the clues he left and find it - thats where you, as Nancy, come in. Cause she can solve anything, right? Right. This is a commonly used plot in the ND series, but it was very well executed by Her Interactive. There is the perfect balance of mystery, romance, excitement, history, a bit of spookiness, humor - just about everything you could ask for. A good Nancy Drew game is nothing without a good plot, and this plot ranks up there among the best!CHARACTERS - 5/5: The characters in this game are a huge improvement over the lackluster characters in SOTOC #12. Each one has their own personality and they're all fun to interact with. Lori Girard is a ditsy socialite who's desperate for attention, Charleena Purcell is a big time romance writer who we met in Secret of Shadow Ranch (She's a little annoying IMO), John Grey is the host of ghost chaser show, but his character doesn't really do anything, Tino Balducci is a hot-shot detective who got his big break when he just happened to be in the right place at the right time, and Frank and Joe Hardy are, as always, fun to talk to and very helpful. My favorite character in this game was Fatima from the gift shop - she was soo funny! ""It's FATIMA, with an F, none of that freaky PH stuff!"" Hahahahaah!SETTING - 5/5: The train was very beautiful. Very antique and a bit creepy at times, it fit the time period when it was built perfectly. All of the train cars were really well done. The gift shop and Copper Gorge was nice, too. The morgue was bit creepy - as it should be, but there wasn't much to explore there. And the desert at the end was very life-like. You could tell that a lot of work was put into this game. I only wish that there was more to explore at Copper Gorge, but we can't have everything I guess.PUZZLES - 4.5/5: The puzzles in this game were alot harder than the last one. Which is good, cause the last game was pretty easy. Some of the puzzles were really easy and repetitive (all those pipes!), and some were really complicated. Plus there were some puzzles that were really simple but just hard to do. It was a good balance between easy and hard. I used a walkthrough for this game alot more than the last game, because some of the puzzles (like those dolls) were just too confusing for me. But overall the puzzles were really good!IS IT CHALLENGING?: Yes, especially the first time you play it. On a scale of 1 to 5, I'd give it a 4, but if you're really good at puzzles it might not be so hard for you.ENDING - 5/5: I'd say that the maze at the end is pretty easy, but the memorizing part (for me, at least) was challenging. I died more than a few times trying to figure it out. But the culprit was really unexpected and had an interesting motive. The escape at the end was like a roller coaster, I just thought it was awesome! Very well done!Final Score:Plot: 5Characters: 5Setting: 5Puzzles: 4.5Challenge: 4Ending: 5= 28.5 divided by 6 = 4.75 rounded to 5 stars"
80838,1,"I grew tired of Norton SLOWING DOWN my computer...their Security software works pretty good, but hogs resources. And doesn't block all the adware.Pc-cillin installed without a hitch. Cleaned up my hard drive, even removed that pesky elitebar adware...which had drive me nuts for months. No other ""removal"" program had been able to remove all of it.I do wish Trend Micro's software could block banner ads...maybe in an upgrade?In a word, I highly recommend the PC-cillin program. My computer now runs MUCH faster than with Norton, and no more elitebar problem! Thank God!"
41411,1,"This is a software for you to put in your own recipes. Exactly what I was looking for. Left side is for ingredients and the right side is your instructions for the recipe. You create your own index, chapters, as many as you want and you can even put a photo with the recipe. Very user friendly. Everything is right there. Click this, type in what you want. Click that, type in what you want. You can copy and paste a recipe and photo from any website and paste it in your cookbook. I have NO patience for computers and this was extremely easy to do. Customer Service, via email is the best. Every question I asked was answered promptly.I cannot say enough about the service that goes with this software. I am having so much fun putting in my recipes through this software. You gotta get this software!"
36243,0,"I have mixed feelings about this product. First, Carrara is excellent. It gives you great power to produce superb graphic content. My main objection is about the company METACREATIONS. I bought both the 3D Suite and Carrara back in January of this year. I was qualified for a $200 rebate by making such a purchase. Here it is April and I have yet to see the rebate check. They still mail me promotional materials urging me to buy the very same programs that I bought and registered. You would think that a company producing computer software might at least have a current database of their customers and a history of their purchases. Evidently Metacrations does not. If any body from Metacreations is reading this I would like to say that you have excellent programmers and artists. But your marketing, management and customer relations definitely need improvement. And I would like to ask, Where is my rebate?"
38094,1,"I love this game - it's the most realistic horse game I've ever played. I know it has some flaws, but they're not even that bad. Trust me. I'm the essence of getting annoyed at games for flaws, and this is really not that bad. I love it!"

49081,0,"I am very disappointed there is no 64 bit version. I read everything I could find on the Microsoft website pre-release date and nothing said you would need to order a separate Dvd. Microsoft is just trying to be cheap. I hope they get a class action Law suite. I am very disappointed that Amazon did not let me know I was not getting the 64 bit version. I did look at other sites and they said they only had the 32 bit version. The other site had a better price, but it looked like Amazon was shipping the 64 bit version with the 32 bit. Surprise, Amazon should pay its customers for the 9.95 to get the 64 bit version until they update there site with correct description of Home Premium. I am unhappy."
86038,2,"Several fundamental problems have brought me to giving this program one star.First off, the install went smoothly but Garmin's piracy prevention strategy really sucks *AND* blows. The worst I have ever seen in any major software product in many years. A big headache and very intrusive about demanding lots of personal information before it will let you complete the install and unlock the program. An active Internet connection is mandatory during the install process. This point alone may lead me to never buy another Garmin mapping software product. You can feed it some bogus information but do so at your own risk, since your access to customer service will be based on that personal data, which immediately gets saved on Garmin's corporate servers. And if you don't give them a valid email address, you can't complete the install. Delorme is a MUCH friendlier company in all of these regards.Anyway, I purchased this product based on the belief that it would export map files to my Obscenely expensive Garmin Rino 530 GPS+GMRS radio. I read everything I could find on the Garmin web site about which mapping programs were ""compatible"" with the Rino 530. I now know that there are degrees of ""compatibility"" that would have been nice to know about in advance! I can import/export waypoints and tracks but not maps! ARGH!!! Money wasted!!! And you don't find this out until you have registered and unlocked the product and locked it to the electronic serial number of your GPS!!! A warning about limited compatibility would have been very nice.Thirdly, now that I have City Navigator NT installed on my PC, I see that it is a rather pathetic, limited, error-riddled mapping program with old mapping data that is a complete joke when compared to Delorme Street Atlas USA. The difference in quality is so striking that the comparison that comes to mind is the sibling contrast in the movie ""Twins."" Delorme lets you use all kinds of GPS's with their programs without any absurd ESN locking although map export files are limited to Delorme GPS's and PDA GPS programs. I do wish Delorme had a lot more waypoint/track/route import/export file format support.In conclusion I wish that I had not wasted money on this program and further, I am beginning to feel the same way about my Rino 530.Buyer beware"

51420,1,"I have tried about all of them, and the problem is either they do not find everything or they just take up too much of the resources computer. Spywaredetector, made by this company, had a huge advantage. Once it went through the first scan, the next scan takes about 2 minutes or less. This is what I expected from the 2007 version of the Security Suite. I actually had emailed the company asking if they would ever come out with more than just aspyware detector. Although the 2007 version did find everything and did not lock up the computer at all, it was somewhat slow. I went back to my usual combination of TrendPCCillin (which never finds everything, but at leastdoes not lock up the resources of your computer anymore) and SpywareDoctor. The latter now comes as Spyware Doctor with Antivirus, which I actually purchased as a two-user version online. It does find everything and well, but it locks up the computer to an unbelievable amount and it only comes in a 2 or 5 version version. I much prefer the 3 user version. Once I actually paid 75 dollars apiece for two installations of the Panda software known sold under the Staples brand name. This was TERRIBLE software that locked up the computer completely and the version of last year was apparently no better.Of all of these, I think this is the best..if you are going to pay any money at least. With viruses hitting ever more, if you HAVE to use Windows, as I do, then this is the best, easiest, and least time-consuming software to use.Right now, late September 2007, it seems you can only get it online from F-Secure (the 2008 version). They have a special going on..with comes with a free 1GB drive Flash drive..which I can always use and a small discount.I think this is the best buy of all..in terms of you need only one program to do it all, and it does not lock up your computer at all.Please feel free to ask me any question at all.F-Secure is a leader in software to find viruses on mobile phones.Also, I think this might be a very good company to invest your money in..if you are interested in investing in any Indian companies.Alex Maasa.maas@cox.net"
80817,1,I have no doubt that there are people writing reviews here connected with other products such as NAV that have conflicts of interest and are not giving this product a good or excellent review which is what it deserves..I am very experienced with computer protection programs and let me say right now that imo PC-Cillin 2005 ROCKS..It was rated #1 by Zdnet of all the AV programs for 2005and I totally agree having tried most of them and being a Norton user for the last 8 years.. I dumped that dog..I receive more AUTOMATED virus definition updates from PC-Cillin in ONE DAY than I used to get in a WEEK from Norton..Things change and products either keep up with the times or they don't .. Norton hasn't .. The new STAR on the scene today in 2005 is PC-Cillin.. anyone that says different either has an conflict of interest or frankly is just wrong..
15202,1,"This is the 3rd year that I have used TaxCut software, and this is by far the easiest version. I experienced none of the technical problems reported by some other reviewers below.

33098,1,"Even though this disc is mostly for those who are running newer PCs, it works fine on older ones too. We got this back in 1998 after we had gotten a newer computer and needed newer compatible versions of these games (we had Putt-Putt Joins the Parade and Fatty Bear's Birthday Surprise, but not Putt-Putt Goes to the Moon.) Included on the CD are the 1995 Windows versions (designed for Windows 3.1 and higher, but they also work really well on Windows XP), the Macintosh versions (you would need an older Mac capable of running Mac OS 9 or a Macintosh G4 running OS X Panther or Tiger that is capable of using the ""Classic"" mode to do so), and believe it or not, the original MS-DOS versions of the early 1990s! I imagine these were included if one could not run the 1995 updated versions on an older PC, but could run the DOS versions fine.If you plan to run these on Linux or on a much newer Macintosh computer, you would need to download the ScummVM open-source game emulator program (it's a free download), as these old HE games used the Scumm engine, and run really well. The main differences between the updated Windows versions and the older DOS versions (at least when played on ScummVM) is that the DOS versions use MIDI music instead of compressed digital music files like the Windows versions do (on ScummVM you get excellent results with the music when running the MIDI music off your computer's sound card), and the DOS version has larger yellow cursors instead of the smaller standard white cursors, but other than that, they are pretty much identical and the gameplay is exactly the same.These games are still great for younger kids, and in addition, there is always some sort of variation each time you play, so it isn't always exactly the same every time (for example, Baby Beep will always look different, Fatty Bear must look for the missing ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" sign letters in different places each time, and you would need a different key each time to get in the rocket on the moon.)"

48427,1,"This release has been tremendously improved and therefore remains the most suitable tool for specialists. Unluckily, the documentation is too poor and no further handbook is available in the market. It also undergoes more crashes than the previous release: this is probably intended to avoid that dangerous fonts (i.e., with major or minor shortcomings, such as point overlappings) be loaded in word processors. Therefore some defective fonts are better handled with the older release."
48399,1,"For the most part, I enjoy using the Street Atlas USA 2007 from Delorme. I have tried it without a GPS unit and have it on my Ipaq Pocket PC. I use a air vent holder for my pda and am able to get around with it. I bought a Holux Bluetooth GPS unit and was able to get the two to talk with each other very easily. While driving around in my four state sales territory, this is the way to go. I like being able to create road routes and am able to find my customers much easier and with much less stress and eye strain rather than using a paper map. I also think this is much safer as I am not having to look down at a map on the seat next to me. The two pieces work together well and are very responsive as my vehicle moves. There has only been one instance in a small town where the streets were unable to be found. That is why I gave it a 4. But there will be times that happens. I actually give it a 4.5."

28989,0,"Okay, so maybe I may be outdated, but I like my old Microsoft Greetings better than this. I thought that getting this would advance my label-making, but it just got harder to figure out.First of all, there are no pictures to show me the type of labels or cards I want to make. It's all only in text. My old software would have pictures of the size of cards I want to make, or pictures of a whole sheet of labels I want to make so I can just click and choose. Just by looking at the sheet of labels in my hand, I can compare with the picture on the computer and choose the correct template. With this PrintArtist however, I need to figure out the label NUMBER and with no pictures of the templates, I have to hope I chose the right one.Also, this software doesn't have the Avery round label # 5293 template. I've looked and looked. You'd think something so new would have a common label template as the 5293. Then someone helped me to adjust the settings of one of the given round labels. To have to realign the height, width, margins, etc. was a pain and it shouldn't have to come to that, don't you think?"

Some folks have complained about the suction cups but if you'll clean your screen first and then wipe a damp cloth over the suction cups they work fine.I'm currently running Windows XP but I understand this device will work with Vista as well since Microsoft has apparently resolved the issue of Vista resetting your monitor profile.Great product for the price!"
36569,1,"The Top Ten Family Fun Pack is rather difficult when it comes to getting started. After installing some of the games, you may find it hard to learn how to play. Games like Theme Hospital and Sim Copter are easy to learn because of the tutorials that you can run. Other games like Sim Earth and Sim Life are more difficult because no tutorial is supplied and it can take quite a long time to search through the help file and find that certain section you are looking for. One note to consumers is that Theme Park will not work unless your computer's DOS version can recognize a mouse. Most of the newer computers are capable of playing Theme Park. Any computer manufactured before 1998 may not be capable of running Theme Park. Check with your computer manufacturer for more information and to find out if you are capable of running Theme Park."
27352,1,This is one of the best preschool software CD's my son owns. He is 3 1/2 and can navigate around the program very well. It has different levels for when you master the easier stuff. This is the one he always ask to play first and he is finally learning his ABC's where before he refused to even talk about letters. Thanks Disney!!
53605,1,"I know this is a great game, but the one I bought would not work on my computer, it only works up to Windows 95. Bummer. My fault, should have read more carefully. I'm trying to find someone who has an old enough version that they can use it."
94242,2,"... Words cannot describe how bad this is. I see a lot of folks have noted major issues with Windows XP. But I have had all the same problems and more with Windows 2000: system crashes, slow performance, incomplete shutdowns. And no, you don't even need to be using the program to experience these issues. Installing it alone will do the damage. On top of that, the interface and logic of the program are poorly thought out (I only know this have been able to use previous versions of this, to an extent.) In compiling a CD project, if the program fails to read one disc (which it does often), the whole project must be scrapped. This program goes beyond useless and is actually a threat to the health of any operating system. People keep buying it because the basic version comes bundled with many systems, the packaging is slick, and it continues to be given prominent shelf space in retail stores, and prominent promotion on the web. Do not be fooled. This is poison."
1509,1,"I needed Outlook not the whole office system. I had already Office 2007 and don't see any need to upgrade to 2010. Outlook 2007 is to sync to my Blackberry and manage my contacts. This product is very solid in calendaring, and contacts. Don't waste money buying more Office than you need."
54791,1,"I absolutely love the Ultimate X-Men series, so when I saw this, I had to get it. It's complete up to May 2006 and even includes the annuals. They reprinted the entire book from cover to cover...even the ads!The comics were scanned at their normal printed size, so they are viewed perfectly on a computer (although you may have to scroll down, depending on your monitor size), and look amazing.Definately worth the price."
80900,1,"I found the product to work very well for antivirus, spyware and spam. It is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance. I had been using Norton 2004, but it only did a good job on viruses. Although it would detect spyware after the fact, it did a poor job of removing them. I had also used the MS beta, which although detected more spyware than Norton, would not block it. I had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware. Since I installed PC-Cillin, I've had no problems. I've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well, catching about 80% of the spam. I had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook, that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam, so this is a big improvement.My only complaint is the rebate- I sent in the required info and it was rejected due to ""invalid/missing UPS."" I then sent a copy of the UPS they indicated that was missing, but never got anything back."
5757,1,"I find Norton Personal Firewall to be a very frustrating at times. However it does its job. I tried establishing a remote desktop connection and spent many frustrating attempts before getting it to work. If you're trying to set up a remote desktop connection you first have to open the proper port (3389) then create a general rule. The rule should allow inbound connections, from a specific computer (if static IP Address) for more security or it can be set from any computer, Communications: Any (should work with local port 3389), Protocol: TCP and UDP, tracking: security alert and logging."
94885,1,"I purchased the Systemworks 2005 and installed it. You also have the option to install the GoBack and Check It Diagnostic tools. I installed them both. One word of warning, I have Window XP Professional and the GoBack function and Windows computer restore are the same type of function. I wasn't aware of this before but having the 2 programs running at the same time is unnecessary and unfortunatly I found out the hard way. My computer would not reboot properly because of a GoBack error and there was no way for me to get to my desktop to disable the GoBack feature. Therefore I had to take my computer in for repairs which costs me an arm and a leg. Now my GoBack function is removed and I no longer have any problems. Hope this information will help someone in the future. Symantec certainly isn't going to warn you before hand."
71265,1,Great decision.Excellent sneaky way to build up something against customer's kidnapping from microsoft. Suite needs better and more promotion. I look forward to buy it or download it asap. It would be great to have in spanish for my people at the company.
33271,1,"I have used PC Study Bible for a good 10 years and there is no question that this is the easiest to use software available for the money. Unlike other software programs, all resources are automatically linked so you can immediately go to a related reference or references in commentaries, the Hebrew or Greek, etc. Plus, in every resource, there is a window to view verses so you don't have to go back to the Bible program. You can also view up to 8 versions of the Bible at one time. I could go on and on.I noticed the reviewer who rated it only two stars had a problem with it but that is because the new version is so hefty, you simply have to have a more recent computer. I had some initial problems with the new version as well (didn't work with NT and 2000) but they have cleared all these up and it now runs like a charm (all new versions have the update).No question...this is the best product for any layperson who doesn't want to do verb parsing, etc. There simply isn't anything that works as well and is as easy to use."
49871,1,"The previous reviwer (cavie95) said you cant play this game online as its only LAN based. Whilte it's true that you cannot play online with the game straight out of the box, you can use a 3rd party tool called 'Battle'LAN' you can play this game online sucessully. This tool is designed just for this purpose, to bring LAN games to the net... this method has been used for a long time - which is why people are saying just saying its online. You can find Battle.LAN here : http://www.infoceptor.com/files/war3/battlelan.zipTo make it work you simply...- Give each other you're IP addresses.- Enter each others IP address into battlelan, click the 'ADD' button and then 'START'- Launch into joey the passion, one selects to act as host & other joins..- Have fun!Onto the actual game, one boosts the total number of cards to 771 (it add's 350) - Providing you own the first two games (Yugi The Destiny and Kaib the revenge). This has a LOT more options than prevous PoC titles, forbidden card lists, power over the cards joey has access too (his own or all of them) and Joeys skill level increases the more you duel him - you can also redo the WON CARDS screen to get a new card, so you never have to duel for hours to get those elusive cards again. The AI is some of the best yet, he uses Quick-Play magic cards, acts a lot more 'human' than previous titles (and even GBA titles).Highley Recommended to any Yu-Gi-Oh fan that wants to take the fight online.This is the best POC game out, and probably the best dueling experience available on all the platforms. GBA titles move over - Yugioh is coming to the net!"
10620,1,Works as advertised. No features that the average user would miss. Opens Mac & PC files flawlessly on Macbook Pro with OS 10.4. Should also be upgradeable to offfice 2008.
21206,1,"This software both works as an independent product, or links in to Sound Forge and other programs.

I haven't found anything else that compares to it."
9650,1,"Of course it is for a Mac and it is, in my opinion, a lot better than &#34;Family Tree&#34; which I used prior to purchasing my Mac. It is so much easier and will present more facts a lot quicker not to mention the ability to put pictures with the information so you immediately can see who is being presented."
48842,1,"The reviews here seem to divide into really love this product or really hate it. I'm in the really love it category. I needed to put together a website for my business, but I'm certainly not a programmer. This software allowed me to put together a very satisfactory website in a weekend with a few snags. The website has a dozen pages, hyperlinks, graphic, nice background/foreground color effects, and pdf download links - not real sophistocated stuff, but very satisfactory for my purposes. I've gotten lots of compliments about it spontaneously from users, and it has absolutely increased my business.The several snags I encountered when putting this together required me to seek support from the manufacturer. Unlike some of the other posters here, I got email responses to my queries within a few days for each of the problems I ran into, and especially pleasing was that the suggestions in the responses promptly solved the problem in question each time. A few days ago I ran into another problem with how the software was displaying on my monitor; a quick emailed response from the company today solved this problem with one simple setting change. This is way better support than I've encountered with most other vendors I've dealt with over the years."
56673,1,Excellent product to play CDs and DVDs quickly. We are satisfied with this purchase and we recommend it for those businesses that must deliver reports and videos every day of personalized cd or dvd
41333,1,"I've been a long-time user of MediaStudio Pro. Once again they have surpassed everyone (including Premiere) with very cool, advanced features. Instant Playback and DVD authoring are well worth the upgrade. Highly recommended! You still get the other modules that put it over the top in value - VideoPaint and CG Infinity. Enjoy!"
75130,1,"OK... so someone says they can't open it (are they trying to run it on a computer that isn't compatible?)... someone else says the software doesn't work with their phone (it says clearly, before opening the box, to go to their website and make sure your phone is compatible... and they are still giving refunds! And let's be real... $15 for unlimited ring tones is dirt cheap - yeah... one license per phone.... tough! They have to be able to stay in business. Although this software, like any other, has glitches... it you follow the step by step instructions (and maybe and email back and forth), you'll find this to be a delight. My only caution in that you have to set your phone up, you have to edit the clips so they are short enough to send, and you have to follow instructions. If you expect to simply load... and start sending ringtones, then don't buy this... if on the other hand, you can follow some basic instructions and have a little patience, you'll find this to be a real gem. Besides... what do you expect for $15!!"
6758,2,"I bought this software because I was desperate to find a any Chinese learning software, so I bought this one an also the Rosetta Chinese learning software.Chinese now is the worst software I ever used, the user interface is very poorly designed and it crashes all the time.The software offer you meaningless translations and the speech recognition part is completely unusable recording less than one second of speech, you never have time to finish a word before it's done recording.My only advice is do not buy this software!, Only the package looks nice. You're much better off with a book and a tape"
14888,1,"Great Expansion pack, worth the 20 bucks, and yeah its only 20 not 25 sk29009 and whoever cant pay 20 dollars for somethin needs to get outta mommys basement and get a job."
45619,0,After installing and configuring it was quite fun to watch the product continuously update itself with megabytes of the same information. I would expect a much better meta repository update engine providing inforamtion to the virus and protection engine that ensures my computer safety. Maybe I am just accustomed to NAT and Corporate firewall protection insulating me to the current market place for this type of product. Not sure how to conclude the review as the vote is still out...
68665,1,I needed this product so my home computer was compatible with the forms used in my job.
12421,1,"Without exception, I have hated every other Microsoft product to be sold. While programs still occasionally crash for no apparent reason, the OS generally survives and keeps functioning on a decent level. This is by far the most stable microsoft product available. One hint: if the computer appears to be hopelessly locked up and your computer manufacturer was so arrogant as to not put a reset button on your box, pull the plug if you get tired of waiting, but make sure and let the check disk run unmolested when you restart."
32317,1,"I bought this just to get the Picture It! program. It's a photo program that is easy to use, not complicated like PhotoShop, etc. I already own it, but cannot locate the disk at this time so I decided that I'd just buy another one. After some research I found that others wanted up to and over $198.00 for the individual program. Fortunately, I did my research and found this entire Microsoft Works Suite (which included Picture It!) for $17.98. What a deal!It arrived in perfect condition, works fabulously and I'm a very happy consumer. The vendor sold their product so they are happy. I got exactly what I wanted at a great price so I'm happy. If only everything else in life was so easy..Microsoft Works Suite 2005 [Old Version]."
15742,1,"As a screenwriter I find this tool absolutely essential in order to appear professional. The ""Tip of the Day"" is a great opener to the program. Everything is made easy in terms of formatting and it's easy to just open up and start using. There's lots of great little tools like being able to see your script with index cards and being able to make notes. Everything's at your fingertips like creating a pdf and registering the script with the WGA and it's pretty much the standard in Hollywood. What more can you ask for?"
1560,0,"I like the software but there are aspects of it that I was not aware of--like needing a special internet service in order to use all the features.It would have been nice to have had this pointed out in the reviews--if it was there, I never saw it."

47419,1,We tried many programs when starting our web site and this was by far one of the best. It is easy to use and it has everything you need. The drop and drag features are great and it has a built in HTML editor. I would recommend this one to anyone wanting to get a web site up and running.
46657,1,"I've used TOPO! for eight years and it's the best there is for mapping software. I own software for 10 of the western states and use the program almost daily. I use the program in my laptop and when hooked up to my GPS, I have what amounts to a super detailed car navigation system with a 17"" screen. As new maps become available, you can download them free into your computer as needed and it's a very easy procedure. Also, free upgrades are available on-line and that's an easy procedure too.To make the state series most useable, you need to add Back Roads Explorer, which gives much more detailed up-to-date street and street name information.The only caveates with this program is that you need a relatively fast computer and lots of memory so you can copy the whole program to your hard drive so you don't have to constantly change cd's. Also, expect to take some time to fully get to know this program."

27088,1,"OK, I am a HUGE fan of the Nancy Drew games and I've beaten all of them and can't wait until the next one! I must say this is one of the most interesting!It's so unlike the others and you get to do many things you wouldn't otherwise do. However, you know how sometimes things are fun at first but then they're just tedious work? That's how it was for me. The roadster thing was pretty fun at first but eventually just got very annoying.You also get to do Putt-Putt and some other things you would't expect from a Nancy Drew game, but these are truly the most high quality games I've ever played (and I've played a lot of games) and you really can expect the unexpected with Her Interactive (the makers of the game.)The characters aren't as good as I had wished but they're still excellent and the storyline is a tad confusing but way better than most games. BUY IT. NOW!I also reccomend Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon. :)"
548,1,"The .Mac suite of services is a very powerful tool yet comphrehensive enough for anybody to use. Not only that but it is a constantly evolving interactive tool as well.Just in the last year I am amazed at the amount of interface tutorials and upgrades that have been added to my account. All free of charge!I am not sure what it is like from the PC perspective but I can tell you that as a Mac user it handles my digital photo's, calender, address book and maybe most significant of all, the backup of my important files and information.Wow!Throw in web publishing with no need for any training or knowledge of html.More bang for your hundred bucks than anything else I have used including software, hardware, online services, galleries, email services and the list goes on.To top it off I can access the full scope of services and all my files from any computer anywhere in the world. My web pages are easily viewable by those using Apple or PC platforms too.The only thing it hasn't done on a ""click"" is upload Adobe psd files but that is easily accomplished by converting those to tiff or jpeg.Good luck!"

55620,0,"I live a a house trailer, 15 x 60. Basically a big rectangle. How much more simple could it be? But, it has a skirting raising it 3 ft off the ground. Thus my deck is also raised 3 ft up. An add-on room is an 18"" step down.After many tries I gave up trying to get this simple arrangement. The program insists I am either resting on a slab or on a footing and foundation, which I cannot raise the height on. The foundation is automatically set down in the the earth.I have access doors at grade level to crawl under the house, but the program will not let me drag a door down that far.My deck auto connects to the room level and I cannot raise it to show the space under neath. Decks seem to be only set at ground levelI tried faking a very low first story for the 3ft supports but this didn't work. You can edit ""rooms"" and lower their height but somehow this then raised the height on the floor above (my actual first level)I find the manual to be minimal without additional tutorial on multilevel connecting rooms.I cannot recommend it unless you are a master at work-arounds and gimmicky to overcome the programs limitations."

It is great becausethe globe encourages VISUAL, AUDIO AND TACTILE learning.

76438,0,"Been doing own taxes for 30 years, using Turbo Tax (TT) for about 6 years. It seems to do well on Federal returns, but watch out on your state return. I've discovered two very basic, yet very expensive errors when using TT for my state return. TT tends to simply import values from lines of the Fereral Return into the State Return ignoring that individual states might have special rules for the entry. In one case, my state treats an entry almost the same as the Feds, but TT did not even apply the Federal rules to the entry, much less the state rule. Such errors compound themselves as they are used in other calculations. The end result being a nasty surprise when you finally realize you have to prepare amended state returns for previous years and cough up thousands of $. I've tried alerting TT to these problems, but so far my efforts have fallen on deaf ears. Bottom line, don't use TT for state returns unless you know your state regulations and double check the TT results carefully."

63952,1,I bought Dark Basic knowing a little bit about it. I had used the demo program and found it something I wanted. I bought the basic Dark Basic program off the net from Amazon and I will be honest I thought I had been conned. I played around with it for a few days and after reading the manual I started making simple programs. It took time to get the graphics part of the program to make a game but I did it after a lot of trail and error. There are some positives about Dark Basic that you should know about. One thing is that is has a duel board. When the program runs there are three things. One is the help index which tells you the commands and gives examples. The other thing is the active boards where you program titled 1 and 2. This might seem redundant but when you start programming you will thank the developers for putting in this feature. The double programming boards allow you to run either different versions of the same program or snippets of code without adjusting the main program. Another feature is the manual which has a break down of all the commands and how to use them along with a short but useful course on how to do basic programming and all the things you need to know to start out. Overall I give Dark Basic a 10 out of 10 for those looking to program games 3D or otherwise. Dark Basic is not meant for science functions or business applications as far as I can see but if you want to make a good 3D game this is something you should think about. If you think it is good enough for the basics then there are more advanced versions with add on items to help you make a game.
42413,2,"My review is plain and simple: Microsoft Office 2007 is a pain. I hate it.Unfortunately, Microsoft Office software designers decided to redesign the look entirely, and the result is forcing users everywhere to completely relearn the entire software. They tried to make the options more ""user-friendly"", but for someone who is wanting to do more advanced documents, creation time is at least doubled. I'm not sure what the problem with the old software was, but they should consider reverting 2007 to a format more like Office 2003."
81842,1,"Almost everybody who is on the Net has the free download Adobe Acrobat Reader. With this reader, users are able to view .pdf documents in exactly the same format the writer published it. So, how did the writer publish his or her .pdf? Answer: he paid a lot more and got the non-freeware version of Adobe Acrobat (sometimes called Adobe Acrobat Pro or Adobe Acrobat Writer).There is absolutely no doubt that this software is essential if you produce a lot of documents electronically. In any other format (HTML, Word, etc), you run the risk that the users' machines will reconfigure your document in ways that you hadn't intended. Adobe Acrobat locks your publication into a format that can be transferred between computers and across computer platforms.It is, however, priced for the office user. Home users, once again, have to shell out over $... for the standard version and $... for the upgrade. It's a shame, as home computers are not just about games and surfing the Net. Some people do some serious writing outside of the office. If home users could pay half the price for this product, it would be well worth it."
44319,1,"I only purchased this because I purchased a new laptop that couldn't run Office 2003 (which I loved). I haven't had any real problems, except that it is so different it takes additional time to complete projects because everything is in a different place or doesn't work the same. I'm sure, as I become more proficient with this product, I will like it as much as Office 2003."
38686,1,"This Backyard Soccer 2004 has my favorite players here.Like Brandi Chastain,Tiffity Milbrett,and Cobi Jones.This is a fun game to play,but the hard level still a piece of cake.You can make your color of your team,but the promblem is you have to choose from some choices instead of naming your team.That's my kinda suggestion.I won the game a hundred times already,but I love it and I keep on playing it!I think this is a 4 star rating for one reason why 4 stars,Way too easy!"
15205,1,"For the past few years I have used TurboTax, but because they got rid of the mail-in rebate for e-filing, I decided to try TaxCut instead. I was a little hesitant at first [...], but I thought I'd give it a chance and just take it back if I had a problem.I had no problems with the installation, and my files from last year's TurboTax return imported just fine.In comparison to TurboTax, I found it to be very similar. They ask the same types of questions with TaxCut, and it's just as easy to use. My taxes are relatively simple and I only have a few credits/deductions, but I suspect that even if you do have more complications, it wouldn't matter which program you choose because the questions seemed nearly identical to me.The only problem I have with TaxCut, which is the main reason that I give the product 4 stars instead of 5, is that I believe they charge too much for the e-filing. (Note that TurboTax charges the same fees, so this also applies to TurboTax.) [...] Federal e-filing (when you do it yourself) is free, and I'm sure that most states have free e-filing as well (my state does). [...] Maybe the IRS charges some fees to these software companies in order to complete the e-file, but if so it can't be that much. At least with TaxCut, unlike TurboTax, there is still [...] available for the federal e-filing, but there is none for the state portion.What I am planning to do to save myself some money is e-file my federal return and complete [...], then either print out and mail my state return OR go to Maryland's e-file web site and do it myself, using the numbers that I got from TaxCut. I think TaxCut/TurboTax would make MORE money if they would do away with the mail-in rebates altogether and just charge a SMALL fee of a few dollars for e-filing each return. [...]Overall, I'd recommend TaxCut over TurboTax simply because it is cheaper [...] and the two products are both very similar. I'll probably stick with TaxCut from now on."
58269,1,"I have only played this one game from all the Nancy Drew game series, and I thought it was good and followed the book pretty well. The character animation could have been better, though, and after a while the stopped saying anything new... very good for younger computer game players."

83289,1,"The new Microsoft Office 2007 is by far one of the most useful tools ever created for the computer. Many changes from the 2003 series and several new programs including onenote (a virtual binder) and groove (allows transfer and sync of files across the internet between your laptop and computer or other people) Also, word is smarter and if used with vista you can use voice recognition so you dont have to type a thing. There are loads of new features including smart art which allows you to create professional looking charts and graphs plus you can give your paper multiple themes and its auto-recovery works like a charm if you accidentally shut down. It would take me hours to list how different it is from the previous versions but take my word for it, its well worth the money. The only downsides really are some programs such as Visio or Outlook express 07 seem to have no changes at all with the exception of a theme change."
44917,1,"I want to say that I think Hallmark cards shop is a good program for people who like to make their own cards and do not want a complicated program, but nice variety in the selection and categories for an affordable price. I originally purchased Hallmark Card Studio 2 for my parents who are in their 70's and just learning how to use the computer first time in their life and love making their own cards for all their Senior friends. They have told me frequently they use this program over Create it card program. My father was never into cards and now he really enjoys making cards using his Hallmarks studio 2003. I decided to purchase Hallmarks Card studio 2003 for them and they love the variety of cards in this selection on this program. I highly recommend this for anyone who has parents that don't like anything complicated for them to learn. My mother has trouble with sizing images which she does not have very good mouse control. By using this program she has flexibility of using another arrow feature for sizing her graphics which is only a simple of clicking the up and down arrows and with just one click on the card you select it will zoom the card in nicely for viewing which my mother loves these two features. My father was impressed with this program having much more categories of cards to choose from since they were using Hallmark card studio 2 prior to using this program. The only thing I saw that I did not like is how the program guides you to configuring your printer for a two sided project, which does not give you many choices and my parents HP printer did not completely match the configuration in the program. Otherwise the program is easy to use and very simple for a beginner. I would not recommend this program for someone who likes to do more than selecting a different graphic for their card or make simple changes to the wording and font of the card, which is all this program really does! I was very impressed with the features to sending a card by e-mail was very easy to use. This is a very simple program for someone who does not want all the extra features that they probably will not use. It has another nice feature of making your own labels, stationery, stickers printed envelopes. I hope this review was helpful to others that are looking into a simple card shop or more advance publisher program for card making which would not be for them."
27835,1,"I've been learning guitar from Guitar Method for about 3 months now and am very happy with my progress. The information is laid out in a very intuitive/easy to follow way. The lessons all progress very logically and keep you interested. Best of all, you learn with easy fun songs that make it a lot of fun. Right off the bat, you've got songs to practice the techniques you're learning. As the difficulty in techniques progresses, so do the songs. I'm already to the point where I can play Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan songs. It's a definite must have if you're learning guitar."

79155,1,"Like another reviewer, I'm a little disappointed at the level of information provided by this toy. It depicts continents and oceans, but no individual countries. Perhaps I expected too much, but I was hoping that my kids would be able to tap on a country and hear information about it and perhaps a few words in the native language or the music of the national anthem. But nope. It's mostly animals. I have to admit that my kids (ages 3 and 18 months) really like it. I just wanted it to be more than it is.And take my rating on the durability with a grain of salt. We've only had it for 3 weeks, so I have no idea. But it seems well constructed."

That's not what this program does. If you double-click on a song, it stops the one currently playing and begins the song you clicked on.This program:-Doesn't display cover art,-Has a complicated interface,-Doesn't give complete song info,-Let users exit by simply clicking the &quot;x&quot;,If you're looking for a jukebox program, this isn't it.

9925,1,"Hello folks.I persoanlly think this is the best video game movie ever made. not that many video game movies even come close with the exception of final fantasy VII advent children.I saw this movie in theaters back in 1995 , when I was only 9 years old. this was also during the year of Mortal Kombat 3.the thing that made me happy was that my all time favorite kombatant , Rayden , was played very well by Christopher Lambert. rumor has it that he might return in the upcoming 2010 Mortal Kombat Movie. which would rock if that happends because Christopher Lambert is perfect for the role.Robin Shou as Liu Kang was in deed convincing. although in the next movie it wasnt.it was infact that this movie was inspired by notjust the 1st mortal kombat game , but the second as well. remember near the end when they go to outworld , that was in Mortal Kombat II. same as Sonya being chained up.the one and only problem I have with this movie is that reptile had bugs for blood or something. I didnt really get that part at all. why did reptile have bugs for blood? can anyone explain it to me?but still , I give it 5 stars. just because it brings back good memoires and still rocks to this very day.Mortal kombat the first movie still stands as the all time greatest video game movie ever made."
81124,1,"This chip was absolutely worth it's weight in gold. Actually, more than that. We would have been hopelessly lost on numerous occasions without the GPS, and the European chip was phenominal. If you put in shortest distance for a route, this guy will take you over hill and dale and on roads only barely wide enough for a small car, so it's best to use fastest route or, as we did, put in towns that are near to your present location and a road that you wish to travel. We also used the GPS while walking, and it worked flawlessly. I will never travel again without the GPS. Friends that we visited in Germany were awed by the accuracy of the GPS and are going to buy one."
48086,1,"I ordered this kit with the idea of making the albums as gifts for family members who tend not to put pictures in albums. I thought the size would be perfect to carry in a purse/bag. The company recommends not using the HP All-in-One printers which is what I have. So I borrowed a HP Photosmart . The album pages printed very nicely on my borrowed printer but I couldn't get the cover to print. I was able to print the cover on my All-in-One. I didn't look further into this problem. It may have been a mistake I made. The albums looked great. My family members who received them were tickled! I'm saving the last album in my kit (makes three total) for me! Would buy again. I rated this a ""4 star"" only because it would have been nice if I could have just used my All-in-One. It does sound like the company is working on this issue."

41842,0,"This movie is a re-make of a Soviet era film called PLANETA BURG, The Stormy Planet. I had seen that movie in its original presentation as a little boy and this English version comes very, very close to it. Several Earth ships head to the planet Venus and after a lot of misshaps the astronauts land on it and are attacked by the dangerous animals that inhabit it and the lava flows from underground volcanos. They bring with them a very sophisticated robot called John which resembles up to a point Robbie the robot of the other space movie FORBIDDEN PLANET. They also move around in a floating vehicle. After narrowly escaping destruction they leave in a hurry discovering at this very end that its inhabitants are very much like us. The acting is not bad and there are plenty of special effects with a lot of imagination. I liked it mostly because of the way that space adventures were conceived then. I sincerely recomend viewing it."

26549,1,"I recently attended a presentation at my child's school about keeping kids safe when they use their PC and connect to the Internet. One of the speakers, from the FBI no less, recommended Spector Pro from SpectorSoft so I took a look at the company website when I returned home. After looking at the Spector Pro information there, I had a couple of questions and comments and was amazed to find out that SpectorSoft has live sales persons and technical support 24/7. And I spent almost no time waiting on the phone, which was amazing. I decided to buy the product and take advantage of the option to immediately download the product. It took less than 5 minutes, just like the company suggested. Install was easy and I found setup very intuitive, even though I am not a PC expert.I found that it's true, Spector Pro monitors everything a person does on the PC and the Internet. I especially like the MySpace and Facebook monitoring categories, and the screen snapshots function is amazing ... you get to see exactly what a PC user does, almost like playing back a video. The Top 10 Reports category also is a favorite ... gives me a great overview when I don't have time to look at every detail, which I can if I want to ...Before hearing the FBI recommendation re: Spector Pro, I fooled around with one or two other cheaper programs ... and that's just what they were: cheap. Is your child worth the difference between an also-ran and the best program available, Spector Pro, at $99? Mine is ... many times over ... from now on out it's SpectorSoft or I wouldn't even bother ..."
9351,0,"I have not used Systemworks Pro since version 2002 (and I will never again, it bogs down any PC and the system utilities have messed up my PC way too many times), however I am a very happy user of GoBack 3 De-Luxe and Ghost 2002.I purchased Goback before Roxio sold it to Symantec, so mine still has the Roxio/Adaptec user interface, but hopefully has not been able to mess it up in just a couple of months.I would say: if you like to have a tuned-up working PC (and that should be the reason that pushes one to shop for Systemworks, your best bet is probably to became proficient with Goback and Ghost included in Systemworks and forget about any system cleaning/tuning utilities.Ghost will allow you to create a copy of your system (hopefully at a time when it is working fine) that can be reinstalled in a matter of minutes (or hours, depending on size).Goback allows to goback to the past to undo the bad effects of an installation or anything wrong.It is similar to the system restore that is part of Windows XP or Me, but a lot more powerful (after going back you can still recover specific files from the ""future"" that you might want to keep, or if Windows ain't booting, no problem: Goback Deluxe kicks in before the Bios looks for an OS, so just press the space bar when prompted by GoBack and pick the time to go back to.This is a Duo that keep your system running forever, but you need to learn how to use them properly (Disclaimers, Inc.).Important: my suggestion is to use only Ghost and Goback out of Systemworks, so it takes some tinkering with the installation, and a lot of disabling services and options after the installation, to try to limit the PC paralysis induced by a default Norton installation and to avoid being harassed by the stupid Norton Protected Recycled bin, clean sweeper, windoctor, big brother or whatever else they are called, another option is to get standalone versions of Ghost and Goback, or even better to download free 15 day trials from Symantec, test them out, license them if you like them."

80120,0,"I give Turbo Tax 5 stars and Intuit 1 star, averaging to 3 stars.I've used Mac'N'Tax (the Turbo Tax predecessor that Intuit bought out) and Turbo Tax since the late-80's--so that's a lot of returns. The product has worked very well for me, with only a few complaints. The ability to roll forward your tax information year after year is one of the compelling features of Turbo Tax--once you set up a depreciation, or have credits that carry forward, Turbo Tax populates this information in next year's return.However, I have found Intuit to have become less friendly and more work to deal with as the year's have gone by. If you end up needing technical support your entire experience with the product will probably be soured. In 2003 even though the &quot;Deluxe&quot; product advertised that it came with a free state product, you had to pay to download and then send in the voucher to get your money refunded. Quite annoying, but the real kicker is that the refund never came and Intuit was pretty much unresponsive to my attempts to follow up.I will probably continue using Turbo Tax because the product is solid (at least for me...I see others have had issues), and because once you've got your tax information in for one year, the next year and the next year after that you keep reaping benefits. I just wish some other company would buy the product from Intuit so I could quit dealing with them."

25665,0,"Should you upgrade? Well, kind of, I tend always upgrade to the latest from Symantec. For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to ""Norton Anti-virus 2003"", the programs from Symantec such as System Works and Utilities are just same no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and tools for scanning ""Instant messages"" for viruses. I really don't know why Symantec decided to release this version so early. Yes, I was expecting a 2003 line of products. But I thought that they would of instead released them around mid-2003 when Microsoft Office 11 would debut. Beacause people use MS Office alot and Norton is good at scanning Office files for viruses.So, should you upgrade?If recently purchased System Works 2002 or Norton 2002 or any of the Symantec line of products at least wait until your one year subscription is up. Because that's what you by a utility program for, to keep updated against the latest attacks."
32308,0,"I have been using image database programs for quite some time. Since Taos Image finder was new it perked my interest.I will admit that the GUI is very pleasing and if you have a newer high quality video card you will be impressed with the programs abilty to display and adjust pictures in real time. One area where the program falls short however is in search ability. I was not able to consistantly have the program find what it should doing various searches of an 8,000 picture plus database. This included searches on file size, file name, and hotword entries which had been made prior to the searches. Using two other programs of the same type and the same picture collection produced perfect results each time. In my opinion this program shows much promise. If the internal database and search engines are improved it would truley be a class ""A"" piece of software.I look forward to future releases to see how this application progresses."
4102,1,"If Apple had this OS 5 years ago, they'd have a 30% market share now. What they have here is a modern Unix-based OS with a truly friendly and useful interface but with all the power under the hood. The Mail program that comes with it is quite nice, and contains the best and easiest client-side spam filter I have ever encountered. iCal is nice, but isn't industrial strength.This OS never crashes - the only times I reboot are when upgrading software. Applications crash all the time, but the OS moves right along without a hiccup. Airport works seamlessly with DSL, even with my older base station. Firewire and USB are truly plug and play with no hitches. Quartz looks sharp. PDF is very well supported, and print-to-PDF seems to work well everywhere. Some of the Finder deficiencies of 10.l have been fixed.My only major complaint is that the Java support needs to be updated. I hear that's coming, but I don't want to wait.Minor quibbles: if you have an older printer, you'll have a hard time finding a driver for it. Also, you will need quite a lot of RAM. The minimum of 128 mB specified is too slow. Go with at least 256 - RAM is cheap these days. I also wish that Apple would open-source more of the Apps and OS, although I understand there are licensing problems with some components."

After being told that PC Mover was DESIGNED to be used once, they gave me my serial number which did not work. I just wasted two hours! I never read that the program was designed to be used one time. This is an expensive program. You might want to try a different company. Anybody want some one time software and one time cables?"
68606,1,"The Mega Bible Library Version 6 software package seems to be designed with the home Bible student in mind. It appears to have all the Bible versions most serious Sunday School teachers and small group Bible Study leaders would utilize, including my personal favorite, the New American Standard (NAS)--1995 update. Among the typical Bible package functions it performs are: word searches (simple and 2 element Boolean), dictionary lookups, and parallel passage comparisons.In a package such as this, there are always aspects that perform well and those that are less well conceived or implemented. On balance, the package is nicely suited for the most heavily used features: word searches and parallel Bible references. The user interfaces of those two functions are intuitive and appear to work efficiently. Especially nice is the text copy and ""copy to clipboard"" functions making it simple to move copied passages into your word processor document.The weaker of the features seem to be the manner in which they implemented Strong's number/dictionary lookup and the ""active reference Bible"" toggle (or rather lack of toggle). Suffice it to say that the package does have Stong's Greek and Hebrew dictionary entries tied to the Strong's numbering scheme, however, the user interface into the numbers and dictionary is clumsy. In some future version it would be nice if the package could be made to link the NAS text to the Strong's numbering system so that a double click on a word in NAS would immediately bring up the proper Strong's dictionary entry.That said, this package contains a wealth of other easy to access resources and information. Commentaries, maps, Vine's dictionary, and histories of hymns are all readily accessible and often link to the proper entries with just a simple double click of the mouse. With such a tremendous amount of information included and with so many Bible versions at one's fingertip, for the price, this package is genuinely a very good bargain. I would definitely recommend this software as an entry-level package for any student of the Bible."

94009,0,"Take Two and Direct CD are two programs included with Easy CD Creator. Take Two backs up your hard drive and Direct CD lets you drag files right onto a CD. Sounds good? Well - they don't work in Windows 2000. And if you install them, thinking one day you might get around to using them, well don't. They'll screw up your system. I'm not just saying that either. After days of frustration because my computer wouldn't boot right up, I found on Roxio's Web site that they recommend NOT installing those two programs because they don't work right on Win2K and will cause hang-ups on boot (in some cases up to 2 hours). They are ""legacy"" applications that work better with Win95 or 98. If you have an NT based system (like Win2K and XP) you'd best not waste your time. So do a custom installation and uncheck those two programs. You don't need them anyway.Another tip, if you are upgrading from another CD burning software package, best uninstall it first and reboot your computer then install Roxio. Don't want any trace of a competitor's drivers or things might not work properly after the installation.OK tip number 3 and that it... If you have Windows Media Player 7 installed, make sure that the Roxio CD burning plug-in is NOT installed. It also causes problems. Microsoft and Roxio are pointing the finger back and forth trying to figure out who is to blame, but who cares. Just remove it from WMP7 if you are upgrading to EZCD 5 Platinum.So after all that, I'm still giving a 3 star rating. The installation difficulties by themselves warrant a -50* rating, but the CD & Data burning applications are top notch which is why I bought it in the first place. I'd give it 5 *'s if it weren't for the funky installation and useless add-on programs. They have really improved the interface (looks very Mac OSXish) over version 3 & 4. It really is easy to use (even my husband can burn a CD!) and I applaud Roxio/Adaptec for that. But they got carried away with the rest of the applications which hurts their stellar rating... until next time."

85098,1,"This game is really really cool. You can adopt petz that you have to take care of. You have to feed them, play with them and give them lots of attention. It's SO fun. And you can go to lots of different places such as, Arabia, an Asian Temple, and the South Seas. Also, they can have up to 4 puppyz! But, there are problems. When you're starting the game, it might freeze up and you have to figure out a way to fix it. and in the mini games, you keep getting toys you already have, over and over again. And when your dogz have puppyz, the mom and the puppyz have to stay in the nursury for 7 launch days. And not even the dad can come and visit! So I would buy it if you're willing to face the dowsides, but otherwise, I would but Dogz 3 or 4 instead."

I love Charlton Heston and we've been to the Holy Land and read through the Bible. I am sure that this is excellent series of programs, but, can not make it work. We do have a very new computer, so it isn't that our technology base is out of date. It would be 5 Gold Stars if we could only view it. For the high price we paid for even a used version, I really expected some results. This isn't the product's fault, just that we've learned the hard way to be careful.Update 9-16-12: Responding to a comment just received: We did not originally know it was only a CD. We expected an audio/visual Voyage Through the Bible not an audio book. I've read through the Bible a couple of times, taught adult Bible classes for years and visited the Holy Land and have hundreds of photos. The BIG problem is that it wouldn't play on a computer or any other CD player device we have, it doesn't work period, no audio. We gave up 16 months ago as a lesson learned, sometimes you get a lemon from someone. I don't even know where it is anymore nor care. We've moved on.

The card contained some of the markers for the monuments in Hyde Park. You could zoom out and see the side streets to navigate to the closest tube station. Nuvi never lost a signal on the downtown streets either. The four star rating is only because I cannot vouch for its directions while driving, as I only used it in pedestrian mode."
71285,1,"This is one of the best products that I have ever puchased! I installed it on a system that I built, running Win XP. Within 10 minutes I was expiermenting with the highly powerful image editor. I am a student, and have the need to send and recieve documents in many different formats, and StarOffice does it all. It opens and saves Word files perfectly, without any sort of formatting errors. The only downfalls of this software are the scant documentation and rough user interface. However, once you become accoustomed to it, there is every tool that you could ever need, and many more than you could ever use... :)"

When I clicked on ""Fix"" the message said that I needed to file Alternative Minimum Tax form, but that the form would not be ready until mid-February. I'm stuck because the system won't let me complete the return until the form is complete. The form is listed on the box as one of the forms ""you're likely to need.""By the way, some of my friends had major problems with Turbo Tax last year."

The return process is very user-friendly and I like being able to go back and review/edit previous sections. Also having my 2004 information already saved in last year's TurboTax made this year go much quicker because I didn't have to re-enter employer info, etc. I completed my return on a Sunday, e-filed, and had my state refund direct-deposited into my bank account by the following Thursday and the federal refund came a week later. I will definitely use TurboTax next year!"

75417,1,"I found CS3 to be a really worthy upgrade. It runs faster than CS2 on same machines - even including older G4/G5 Macs. For Intel Macs, the speed gain is even more significant. The Bridge interface has improved a lot. There is a nimber of other improvements, and at the same time, the interface has been kept consistent, so there is no downtime looking where the buttons are now, etc., even if you are upgrading from Photoshop 7.CS1 was the upgrade to skip, but CS3 I recommend.The Extended version's extra features are very handy for what we do in our biomedical microscopy research. Now we can make measurements in Photoshop directly, and tally up and export those measurements."
51158,0,"The software itself isn't terrible, given that it feels like it was designed about six years ago. The next time I'm going to Yosemite, I'll be bringing a map printed by this app. The app has a very nice search feature, will import GPS waypoints, build excellent route elevation graphs, and has a system for adding wee icons to your maps.That said, there are some pretty big problems with using the program for anything other than printing trail maps.In the license agreement the maps you build, save, and print are referred to as &quot;reproductions&quot;:- Reproductions are only for in-house, in-business, or intra-organization purposes- National Geographic Holdings is leasing the reproductions to you; you do not own them- All reproductions must include copyright notices indicating that the maps are owned by NGH- Distribution of printed reproductions (for in-house use as mentioned above) is ok, but for digital reproductions you must contact NGH and get a supplemental license in writingSo, you can lease and print very nice hiking maps for use within your house, business, or company. Using the maps on web sites (even internal ones) or other digital documents is forbidden without entering license negotiations with NGH."

54648,0,"I was excited to find a good deal on the Garmin eTrex at the REI garage sale, but was disappointed to find the GPS without any useful maps.I looking around the internet for mapping software around the internet, and after some research concluded that that the Garmin Topo US was what I needed for all-US coverage. I went ahead and ordered it on Amazon.The DVD it took about 6 days to arrive. It is good software, but here are some caveats:1. Garmin doesn't let you load all the maps onto your microSD card, regardless of whether you have enough storage to store all maps.2. The maps are only 1:100,000 scale: this tells you your general location: if you are looking for more help, expect to buy Garmin's 24K maps for the National Parks (this product actually gives you much more than just national parks) and computer print-outs and waypoints from National Geographic's Topo! 24K maps for local hikes.3. Which leads up to my third caveat: this software (nor any other software out there) is not necessarily self-contained if you want it all- expect to buy other software as well (especially if you want to make use of the eTrex's (or Legend's or Vista's) mapping capabilities inside the city- you would then need to buy the City Navigator or MetroGuide).All in all, it is not a bad product for the price: 60 bucks isn't bad for a product that gives you all-US coverage."
89442,0,"As other reviewers have stated, it's an excellent interactive learning experience for your child. I give it 4 or 5 stars on that alone. But I was dismayed to find that the setup process stuck an AOL promotion on my desktop (my other Reader Rabbit programs also did it). And of course, the unwelcome desktop icon was just a shortcut; I had to search in the Programs folder for the AOL executable file in order to delete it.This sort of thing is not terribly unusual with free applications that you download from the Internet, but when I pay money for a program, I don't expect it to invade my computer with adware junk.Another problem is that once you've started one of the programs running, there's no way to back out of it or shut it down before it quits. There's no right-click menu with a Cancel button or anything like that. Very inconvenient if you're simply giving a program a quick test. I had to use the Windows CTRL-ALT-DEL trick to shut it down in midstream.Still another gripe: the install process does not put the entire disc on your hard drive. To run the program, you have to insert it in your CD or DVD drive before starting it from the Program menu. Remember computers in 1980 with 2 floppy discs to make anything work?Bottom line: great for the kid, but a pain in the behind for whoever does computers in your home."
84360,1,I wonder why so many people hate it. I have never had a problem that was unique to Vista that I did not have with XP. Moving and copying files seem easier it feels slicker and those annoying security windows can be turned off. I guess it's just cool to hate Microsoft. I just upgraded to the 64 bit Ultimate version and so far so good.

It helps you find rest areas, camp grounds and so much more. We LOVE it and it is the best trip taking tool ever!! Keeps my husband and I from fighting (I cant read maps well, LOL). We purchased it for his Dad....his sister purchased one for herself as well."
57160,0,"I agree, this software is good. Great detail. The 3D feature is over-rated, though, for my uses. More of an image gimmick than actual representation of terrain. More importantly, though, my software suddenly &quot;lost&quot; one much-used quad sheet, leaving white space in it's place on my screen. I also lost all the markers and trails associated with that area, which included several day's work. Called their customer service for assistance and was connected to a very rude, arrogant, and unhelpful technician. Result: no fix. The company needs to back an excellent product with helpful and knowledgable technicians."
63076,1,"I have used Windows for years and used a Mac at my work, I always liked the way the Mac handled graphics and also appreciated their ease of use. Mac OS X is so simple to use compared to Windows XP, it is by far the best OS I have ever used. I have not run into one single glitch, my powerbook has not crashed on me once. It had crashed on me a few times with OS 9, but this one seems to be a lot more stable. I like the dashboard also, you can quickly check the weather, stocks, dictionary or calendar all with a push of a button and built into the OS. You can also download many others for free from the Apple website. Itunes is a great application also and it is something I use all day long. Safari is far more superior in just about every-way compared to Microsoft Explorer, in fact it would take to long to list the benefits. I also liked the ability to run OS 9 in classic mode, so you can keep all your older software and still use them within OS X. If you are sick and tired of the Windows fatal exception errors or sending Windows error reports, then buy yourself an Apple and enjoy stress free living with OS X."
72056,1,"I purchased Zone Alarm Pro 4 after researching several of the firewall products out there. I was skeptical at first since I didn't really know much about Broderbund's line of products, but after using the product for several weeks I can say that I am extremely pleased with its performance, reliability, and ability to block unwanted users, content, etc. One of my other concerns was that it would conflict with my Norton Antivirus program, but it has not done so at all and has worked seamlessly with it.The program has an easy to use interface, but comes with many options to suit the more advanced user as well. It will setup the most common programs that you use to access the internet automatically, and then ask permission for other programs that you want to use as well and allow them access to your server/internet connection. You also have the option of turning off all the messages and letting it block things on it's own, but I normally like to see what content it's taking care of.It does a great job of blocking pop-up ads, and I have not seen one since I have installed the program. It also comes with several email features that I have not used, but may come in handy for others. Overall, it is a worthy product that comes at a cheaper price than some of the other options out there. You get a year of free upgrades, and you do have to register it online with Broderbund to get the upgrades."
50880,1,"If you have a Sony Vaio this review is for you. In the past Sony has created small C:\ drives and large D:\ drives. So C:\ quickly fills with additional programs and then you need PM to fix it (move some from D:\ to C:\). But I kept getting errors with PM running in Windows. Sony was no help, and Symantec (who makes PM) had one suggestion - run it in DOS. That solved the problem and then PM works well.Want details? start PM in windows and select ""create rescue discs"". These boot the computer in dos. Next (this will all make sense when you actually do it) select D:\ and tell it to shrink that partition by, say, 10GB AND specify that the 10GB be located IN FRONT of the new, smaller D:\. This places the ""set aside"" space before D:\, but right after C:\. Then select C:\ and tell it to make C:\ larger by 10Gb. If you don't do these steps in this order the program doesn't detect any extra space to give to C:\. It took me hours of ""playing with it"" to figure this out, so I hope this saves someone some grief."

61475,1,"This year, TaxCut has decided to forego a Mac version altogether. Fortunately, Intuit seems to have gotten past their spyware problems from a couple years back. They also seem to have wised up that people don't like to jump through hoops to register the product. Plus, they've gotten away from charging a premium for the Mac version. So a good program has gone back to being just that, a good program.Unfortunately, there is no option to import that data for former TaxCut users. You'll have to import it by hand if you desire to do so. While TurboTax made earlier claims that the option was available to Windows users, it has since been revealed that neither version has the option available.Every year, Intuit seems to do one goofy thing just to annoy people.If you need this for business or rental purposes, fine. Otherwise, save some money and buy the Deluxe version and get a 'free' state download. All that and saving some money."
7387,1,"I use MS Office at work, and at home, but for my daughter's computer this was perfect.Most people don't need the full version of office, and this package has so much for so little money.The full version of Word is reason enough to spend this amount of money. Note: This is not the latest version, but who cares.I would say this is one of the best software deals out there. Unless you need 100% office compatiblity, this is the package for you. If you do, buy the student and teacher version of MS Office. Read the fine print, it is for anyone not using it for business."
56146,1,"Bought to install with Fusion on a mac, and it worked just perfectly!

So glad not to be in Vista :)also - I was really struggling with whether to buy XP Pro instead, which is what I had always had on my pc computers, but Fusion takes over internet connection and other networking issues, so I was glad I saved the $50 by buying home ed. and I hardly notice any difference."

53564,1,"One reason I decided to buy Trend is because PC-cillin 2002 contains a web filter. The filter is there and it works, but the user must enter each site he wants blocked individually, so it's pretty much useless as a product to keep kids from visiting off-limits sites, unless you have a huge list of URLs and want to type them all in and keep maintaining them.The virus scanner is probably the best PC virus product on the market today. I would highly recommend it over Symantec or McAfee, but if you want a web filter, check out CyberSitter or Net Nanny."

4797,1,"To all of you who had problems installing NIS 2004 I say.... &quot;What?&quot;Mine installed with no problems (and I am a microbiologist, not a computer guy). If you're having installation problems, then I would say user error is involved. Not only has it caught and delt with many viruses, it has helped me catch many hackers (probably ametures) trying to hack my computer. This product allows you to track down that person's IP address so you may report it to their ISP. I have done this several times. As far as spam, I don't get any. I don't know if it is because I disabled my MSN Passport (the source of much spam) or if the NIS is working. You guys running older and slower computers probably do not want this software. It is a resource hog when it's in full swing, but mine is only slow on boot up."
14067,1,"Before I bought Spyware Doctor my computer was absurdly infested with spyware. There were pop up ads jumping up all over the place and as soon as I closed one, another would appear. My computer was almost unusable.It was a mess.Spyware Doctor got rid of them all.I have now set SD to automatically scan my system once a day. It has been almost one year since I installed this product and I have experienced only one infection. SD removed that infection the next time it ran. One of the reasons that re-infections are so infrequent is apparently due to ""On Guard"". ""On Guard"" is the part of Spyware Doctor which prevents spyware from even being loaded onto your computer in the first place. It tracks suspicious activity and blocks unwanted interference with your computer before it starts. ""On Guard"" can actually disable programs that you, in fact, want to run. This happened to me. I use a system wide macro program that ""On Guard"" found to be suspicious and blocked. However, the program allows you configure ""On Guard"" to allow your computer to run what would otherwise look like a suspicious program. I did that and my macro program ran fine.Spyware Doctor also does a good job of blocking pop up windows in Internet Explorer, but it does not yet work with Firefox.Overall, I am very, very pleased with the product. The one problem that I have with SD is minor. When the product needs to update, it often causes your browser and / or your email client to freeze up. When that happens you have to reboot, run the update and then start your browser and email client again.Other than that, this software works great."

39284,1,"The only problem I am finding with system mechanic 5 is that it can take many hours to do a system maintenance. I have been using the SM software since about 97 or 98... I have always loved that it really does well with keeping your system running top notch. I have NEVER had a major problem with it, but the last system maintenance I did on my 250Gb SATA (only about 20 being used) hard drive, it took 24 hours to complete... And let me warn you now! If you stop SM in the middle of a task just because you couldn't wait.... GET READY for problems... You have to let it complete. I crashed about 8 times last night because I had to stop it to use my PC... Well, now that it has run completely over night.... I can type this without any trouble ;)... I do recommend this software; they always have problems in the beginning, but thanks to updates.... They have all been fixed in the past."
53137,1,"I was thinking about buying a GPS for my car for a few months before I bought this. The problem I had with all the regular ones was the small display and the price tag (a decent one cost $500+). I was also worried about the ability to update the maps. That is when I came across Microsoft Street and Trips. With my 14"" laptop, I figured I can make it a GPS with a display larger than any $1000 GPS will give me. I bought it at Amazon for $80. This was year and a half back.Now after using it on numerous trips since, I am glad I chose it. It works great. It gives you real-time positioning information and voice guidance (just like any other GPS). It allows you to plan your trips completely (stops, cost, speed, type of roads and what not). It also has list of attractions, restaurants, etc. If your computer has internet connection (which one doesnt, these days?), it can update highway construction information and such.The biggest flip side of the product, if you want to call it one, is that you need a laptop. There are two problems - the cost of laptop (if you dont have one) and power for a long trip. If you dont own a laptop already (which is unlikely, if you are reading this review), I would recommend buying a cheap one now (they come as low as $300 these days). Combined, it will only cost you under $500 (still less than any average GPS - and you will have a laptop of your own!!). For the second problem, I bought a $25 power inverter in my car (from amazon). So I can now keep it on as long as I want.The other nuisance is the wire. The GPS device that comes with this version of Streets and Trips connects to the laptop using a USB cable. That wire make it a little clumsy. The sticky that came with it doesnt stick to the windshield well (you can still leave it on the floor, it will still catch satellite signals). The newer version (2007) comes with a wireless adapter.Overall, I would recommend it over any other GPS in the market."

14856,0,"After buying ACT 2005 and selling it on ebay because it was so buggy I thought I'd tryout Goldmine. I'd used both products in the past and has a fairly positive impression of them both. I must have been nuts. You need to read the reviews of the ACT! product to get a full picture on what its about (it ain't pretty). I tried a 30day free demo of Goldmine but quickly realized the learning curve on that product was very steep. No knock on the product as it seemed full-featured, but I'm looking for something that goes beyond Outlook in terms of managing contacts and integrating with my PDA phone. If Goldmine did it, I'm sure I'd be old and gray trying to figure out how. As they say, there are a lot of goldmine consultants out there - and they're there for a reason.Next onto Maximizer. I read the reviews, what few I could find, and then too downloaded a trail version the software. Gladly I can say it seem similar to ACT! so that was comforting. But again I ran into trouble integrating with Outlook. AND, they product does not support Pocket PC devices at all. (period). Importing a CSV file exported from Act! was excrucitating. It took over an hour to get all the fields to map correctly. But once the data was in it seems pretty intuitive. My problems came in the form of email and calendar management.This product hijacks your PST file somehow. Only problem is when I tried to open an email messagae from within Maximizer, the message wouldn't open. I closed out of the program and re-started Outlook when I got a very scary message telling me I didn't have an outlook file to open! I rebooted the machine and started Outlook again and my email file opened without incident. Very scary. So that one's going to get uninstalled. I can't imagine losing or corrupting a PST file. So now I'm on to Prophet. On the outside it seems to be a good fit as it doesn't replace Outlook but rather is an add-on to the product so Outlook remains your primary contact management system with a whole lot of extra capabilities, or so they claim. Microsoft can solve this problem by letting user of Exchange systems install their Business Contact Manager product that ships with some versions of Office but for some poorly documented reason they don't allow the environments to exist on the same machine, go figure. I had to purchase the Prophet product to test it, which I don't like but they say they have a 30 day guarantee - lets hope so, or on the other hand, perhaps this is the ONE!"
71252,0,"My impressions about this software are mixed. After downloading (9 hours, 10 min from Sun's site) and installing it, I went about checking the features. The first thing I checked out was the MS office compatibility. StarOffice opens and writes MS Office formats easily. The programs (Writer, Calc, etc) are also very powerful and easy to use (for users who know MS Office well). The image editing program has more features relative to PhotoEditor. Now, for the limitations. On my old machine (P-133, 32 MB, Win 95), the program runs a lot slower than MS Office. The startup time is around 15 secs. I know I need more memory on the system, but MS Word used to run reasonably even with other programs open. The other thing to my disappointment was that documents with formulas could not saved in MS Word format. I got strange hieroglyphics when I opened them in Word. The final and most annoying thing was that the program crashed whenever I clicked the Insert menu in Star Writer. In summary, I did not like the idea of checking each document to see whether it transferred cleanly to Word. If the next version of StarOffice offers a PDF conversion option or saves my equations as images, I would be more willing to buy it at the full price. For the time being, I will be using MS Office and learning StarOffice in my spare time. It would also be great if more people accept StarOffice documents, so information will not be lost just because it cannot be saved in MS's formats."

63441,1,"I have successfully produced four 40 minute DVDs, each disc containing 4-5 different chapters of family events. Once everything is edited and compiled, the process of rendering (burning) everything to disk takes about 2 1/2 hours for a 40 minute disk. It is best to disconnect from the internet and shut down all other program (even the anti virus program)when capturing film and then again when rendering. Capturing and rendering is a delicate matter. Some of the shorts edited together I was able to use music from a CD in the background. I had no idea what I doing when I started out and hate the idea of dropping money foolisly. Pinnacle isn't an easy program to learn. The system does crash but if you continually save your material you won't lose it, and an upgrade is free from the Pinnacle Internet page which cured some of the problems I was initially having. I am still learning the system and trying to make it do all that is says it can do. I haven't had a lot of the problems that many of the other folks who've written have had, but I have had to reinstall the program when it was acting up. There is something called dropped frames that occurs when capturing your DV that can bite later on while your in the editing phase of the project and make you feel like tearing out the walls of your workstation. There are many neat features you can add to your movies: fades, dissolves, sound on sound. The actually cutting of the film is fun. Creating chapters is a pain but I haven't really gotten the process down yet. I've yet to produce an analogue DVD...but the clarity of DVD I've produced is everything I had hoped for. I bought a book on Digital Video for Dummys which uses Pinnacle 9 almost exclusively. It was more than helpful. But do your homeowrk, ask a lot of questions about what you want to do before purchasing anything. The card I bought was for DV only rather than AV/DV. The goal was to put all of my old analogue VCR tapes on DVD, which I haven't been able to do. But the digital stuff is good, and I created one DVD of still photos with a CD soundtrack in the background. I have a new computer, 512mg, 200 gb, with firewire/usb ports. Hope this is of help to someone considering this product."

It is still her favorite game, and we keep wishing we could find another which is as much fun. No regrets-find this game somewhere and enjoy!"

Then discovered Photoshop CS2 keeps returning message, ""not responding."" Oxford English Dictionary took a while to get their driver updated, which I had to download and install. I'm getting errors from my new ACP backup system saying my PC is not communicating with its battery unit, but it seems to be working. There are no upgrades available for their driver. Only one of the new Vista games will work on my laptop, even though when I check for driver updates I'm told by Vista and the manufacturer that it's working fine. I think it's a memory problem. The cards, not mine.Managing the file system ownership and permissions settings can be a challenge, It provides better security, however, it can be a pain. By the time one figures this system out, they've forgotten what it was they were trying to do.Except for those who accept the challenge of working through lots of technical problems and don't mind spending lots of time with various tech support people, I would recommend that people hold off until the various companies have their drivers updated. In some cases, as with my laptop, there will be no upgrades and the only answer is a new laptop. If in doubt, check the companies' websites or call their tech support to see if they are ready for Vista. Nothing more exciting than installing an operating system only to find that your hardware and software no long function.Wayne"
34301,1,My four year old loves. We found it easy to understand and the different levels let her work without being frustrated.
72295,1,"We bought this program last year for Christmas and have a million laughs since then making over everyone in our family, including our cat. As a beauty tool the program is a total waste: most of the hairstyles are unrealistic and applying the makeup is difficult. The end result has never been anything but amusing. But if you've ever wondered what your teenage son would look like in a bouffant or thought about a goatee for your 5-year old, this program is for you."
7298,0,"This is a great game for the first couple of days. After that, the novelty wears off pretty fast and frustration sets in at the fact that there are too few options in terms of brushes, colors, and lack of the all important ""undo"" button. It's pretty ridiculous in this day and age to have a ""design"" game and then not be able to use the paint can to fill in details or one part of the outfit without coloring the entire design like any lame paint program can do. If your daughter wants to paint the sleeves a different color than the bodice, she will have to do so with one of two oversized brushes or one of two stamps (star, heart) since the paint can colors the entire outfit and not just specified areas within the black lines. It's still a nice game and we had fun for a couple of days, but I have already ordered a new game for her, because I think this one has a short lifespan with respect to keeping my daughter interested. You could say this game is fabulous ... if you're not too picky and don't expect too much. But I expected more from this title, even if it was designed in 2004."
24510,0,The cd I bought had the 4th and 5th editions on it. When we tried to play the 5th edition on Windows XP it wouldn't work. When we tried to play the 4th edition it asked us to insert the cd but it was already inserted. I went to the Learning Company website and found out that you have to replace the OT5.EXE file with a new one. You can get the instructions here:http://support.encoreusa.com/kb.asp?id=322After we did that it played fine.
64572,1,"This is by far the best computer game I have ever played. It's interesting to have conversations with the various people who visit (or live in) the mansion. It seems as if everyone has something to hide, and you feel totally creeped out as you walk through the halls, listening to the eerie music and occasionally see a spirit walk past. There are a lot of interesting features to this game, including acts of vandalism and an actual seance! The game is challenging and yet possible to finish, and while there is a path you're intended to follow, there is enough leeway in the game for you to make your own choices and complete various tasks in your own time, in your own order. Senior mode can be a little frustrating if you haven't played often, so I would recommend starting off in Junior mode. You can call your friends, Bess and George (who are conveniently always together and always available, even in the wee hours of the morning) for help if you get stuck; somehow they seem to know the outcome of the mystery ahead of time, so they always have advice. There are a lot of nooks and crannies to explore in the mansion, and there are quite a few interesting discoveries you'll make as you make your way through the mansion, solving the mystery. This game is very exciting and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Nancy Drew, or just anyone who likes a good mystery."
16271,1,"Delphi 2005 was like a slap in the face to Borlands loyal customer base and boy have they paid the price for it. A Google search for it would likely bring up blogs with people complaining about it. It was possibly one of the worst development products every produced.So have they learn there lesson with 2006. In a word, Yes for the most part.The new features are great but you can read about them anywhere so I won't say any more about them other than the fact that they pretty much do what they say they will.The question is, 'Is it more stable and usable than 2005'?Well I've used it now for about 3 weeks and it hasn't crashed on me apart from once ( and that was due to repeatedly debugging my code, which had a large memory leak ). It is much faster to start up now that I don't need to load up all the .net stuff just to develop my Win32 app.The downside, well the help still sucks with a lot of stuff missing, the same slow interface is annoying compared to older versions of help.In short Delphi 2006 is pleasurable to use, it works and is pretty solid. Just use google instead of the built in help"
43507,1,I resisted upgrading to Office 2007 until I started to use it at work. It is a great benefit in doing my homework. I wish I had done it sooner.
70420,1,"I bought this program in early September 2006 because I'd come down with a vision problem that made me temporarily partially blind in one eye. I love to read (mostly fan fiction on the internet, but I love to research things too) and was really annoyed that I couldnt read to pass the time while I was waiting for my eye to heal.I downloaded the free version and liked how it worked. Listened to the samples of the Natural Voices, and decided to get the full version. Totally loved the full version. The Natural Voices sound almost perfect. Sometimes they dont get the pronunciations right, and if the program cant figure out what a word is, it'll spell it, but the full version allows you to edit the pronunciations so that you can teach it how to pronounce the words right.My eye is starting to heal now, and I can read almost normally, but I'm still using the program because it's fun to have. Plus, I've been using the program to proof read things that I write so that I can catch mistakes in my own work.From what I've seen this program would be great for the visually impaired, dyslexic, and for people who have other reading problems. It works a lot better than the text-to-speech software that currently comes free with most Windows based computers."
79569,1,"I waited quite a while to buy this upgrade because I had heard of so many installation problems from people who had downloaded and installed the CS3 Beta. I followed Adobe's direction for uninstalling the Beta and had absolutely no problems installing CS3. However, I did have some problems opening both Bridge and ""Get Photos from Camera"" (through the Bridge File menu.) First they did open, they didn't open again until I rebooted the computer. I haven't had the problem again for a while, so I hope it has resolved itself. Now, that it does work for me, I find ""Get Photos from Camera"" is a much improved way to downloaded images.The new Bridge and Photo RAW are great improvements over CS2. You can now open jpegs in Photo RAW and have more controls available in general. In Photoshop itself, the Quick Selection tool is great, as well as the new Black & White Image Adjustment. I haven't used it too much yet, but I think the Smart Filters option seems like a very good idea. Overall, I am very pleased with this Upgrade."
46871,1,"Remember Dogz 1.0 for the computer? (Yes, it was just called &quot;Dogz&quot; at the time, but there's been so many of them since then!) Dogz GBC is VERY similar! It's a lot of fun, and you get to adopt MANY different kinds of Dogz eventually. I just got my copy yesterday (from here, of course!), and I first adopted a Scottie (Chip), who I renamed Benny. He was soooooo cute, but then he grew up after about 3 or 4 hours and went to the hall of fame. Fortunately, I found out that you can re-adopt petz after they've been in the hall of fame! :-) Since I took such good care of Benny, when I went back to the adoption center, I found a new breed waiting for me! A pink mutt named Mitzy! All in all, the program is very fun with lots of surprises, but I was more than somewhat dissapointed when I found out that you don't get 3 special toys, only 1. Other than that, though, it's really great! :-)"
61530,0,"For many years, I've used the Microsoft Map feature of Excel. It's a great little tool that only does a few things but served its purpose well, and on occasion even justified using Excel rather than SPSS or some other data-management tool.Then came OfficeXP, with an Excel version from which Microsoft has stripped that Mapping tool. Now I have to pay hundreds of dollars and gets lots of data I don't want or need (and could find much of on the web anyway)? No thank you.Time to find an alternative..."

38369,1,Does everything I need-have been using Turbotax for 20 years and am quite satisfied with their product. Have tried others for comparison purposes a couple of times and have found them not as well organized and clear.
8499,1,"Seriously, this product is 1000% better then IBM Viavoice. I coul not even dictate in word with that nightmare of a program.With this program I did the minimal training, and it works great! It actually does what it claims it can do (unlike IBM Viavoice)."
90299,1,"Sometimes products are recreated because of need, because of new markets, or like Detroit of the 50's for quick obsolescence. This new Office Product was designed by someone who had too many firecrackers blown up in his face.They throw everything at you either to prove they found everything or that you may find something you like if given millions of choices.Microsoft had not taken a look at the Office Suite in years but they were not laying about idle. Each day for each month for each year they archived GUIs, applets, buttons, toggles, icons, iconlets and other shiny objects that , so that when 1997 came round they were ready to throw all of this accumulated miniutiae at you all at once in tools bars that resemble the twenty some volumes of the OED.But fear not, begin an application, navigate what your used to, complete the project and it works. The rest of the stuff is interesting GUI-babies that rest at the top unused...forever"
999,0,"PhotoShow Deluxe 2.1.1 by Simple Star (published for retail by Broderbund) is a basic, very easy-to-use digital photograph manager and creative projects program that seems geared towards beginner and casual users with shallow requirements. PhotoShow Deluxe provides tools to create desktop wallpaper, screensavers, slideshows that run on computers, slideshow Video CDs that play on DVD players, and HTML photo galleries. The program integrates with a Simple Star website that enables users to purchase mugs, tee-shirts, mouse pads, puzzles, and playing cards based on their photographs. PhotoShow Deluxe also integrates with ShutterFly.com to enable users to share photographs and order prints via the Internet.The photograph slideshow generator in PhotoShow Deluxe is easily the best among consumer-grade digital library management software, including those in PhotoShop Album 2 and ACDSee 6. Whereas other slideshow modules provide only transition effects (i.e., between pictures), PhotoShow Deluxe has delightful special effects that work on the pictures themselves, including picture frames, animated clipart (flying pink elephants, falling leaves, etc.), balloon text captions and video effects (flicker, blur, old film, etc.). ly, like other slideshow generators in its class, PhotoShow Deluxe lacks a timeline management component. As a result, it is nearly impossible to synchronize soundtracks to a slideshow. Because the program keeps all transition effects and special effects active until overridden, the lack of timeline management also makes it difficult to track effects by frame.This version of PhotoShow Deluxe has a bug that limits to the program to a 800 x 600 pixel display on my 1400 x 1050 pixel screen.PhotoShow Deluxe 2.1.1 is a good introductory program with a great slideshow module, but it may be quickly outgrown by regular users. Hopefully future versions will address the PhotoShow Deluxe's structural deficiencies while retaining the program's ease-of-use."
22256,1,"Alright. Herinteractive, I admit, did a great job. A few parts I didn't like though... I felt that the Hardy Boys were supposed to be better than Nancy Drew, and considering that she is the main character, that was slightly depressing. I thought the new cellphone was awesome, except for the fact that I never used the camera on it. Maybe some others found some use for it. The puzzles were deliciously hard, and it had the right amount of challenge in it. The characters were OK. The graphics were lovely, and I was glad that we didn't have to stay in a rickety old train all the game. I'm looking forward to playing the latest nancy drew game!!"
83187,1,"My response to Office 2007 is similar to how I feel about Vista. We all grow accustomed over time to using software and operating systems a certain way and when a really significant new version comes along that changes things, it creates some initial discomfort and even frustration. But if you give the new version a real chance, even to the point of actually doing some reading on how to use it, and then apply what you have learned, there is the eventual realization that someone did put a lot of thought into this and it actually does work better. I am coming to this point now with both Vista and Office 2007. Both are worth the upgrade, but only if you are willing to devote the time and energy it takes to really take advantage of what they offer. Office 2007 may seem more difficult at first, but with familiarity you will come to appreciate the advance it actually represents. There is less need for the degree of personal customization of the interface that most of us required for previous versions of Office because of the much more effective system of ribbons, tabs, groups, and galleries developed for Office 2007."
67363,1,"I love this program and the price is great! Everytime I show it to someone, they end up saying ""you should have shown this to me sooner!"" Then they rush to buy it.I use it for all of my screen capturing & saving and I discover more uses for it with each new project."
31863,1,My friend told me about this computer game. I absolutely have become addicted. I love word games and this is my very favorite. Hardly a night goes by that I don't play. It keeps the brain thinking.
35010,1,"I got a small computer business, and I recommend this to all my clients. It cleans up the hard drive, personilzed or the safe files. it'll defrag, but first it runs a smart check of the harddrive. it'' do you ZIP files, it has a very powerfull firewall. The antivirus works perfect and it has aotumatic update with no boxes to click at all. It has disk snapshot, backup of impoetant system files, and it'll ask if you want to add a system restore point to the deal. Very easy scheduler interface too. It keeps an eye on your disk space and thge anti spyware works great. It has a awesome all-in-one button to do all the above with a safe setting not to mess up anything. There is many options for individual virus scan as folders, files, deep scan quick scan, media scan, custum scan and on and on. it has regystry editor and a awesome regestry defrag. It also has clock syncronizer and a program to check oversized folders. It has sytem monitors which really works awesome and it has PCdiagnostics and System explore to see everything that is happening at your system right now. Media verifier and also a windows error tracker. It has Undo capabilities and other neat recovery tools. It also has many good uninstall applications and even a move application which can move an installed application from one PC to another. This program though takes a little while to do its initial scan, but once that it done you can move it easily. Amazing programming!! Why am I telling you all of this? Because this program has it all, and it is not just crammed in there, they really really thought about it and made something amazing. I used to have to install many different preferred programs to clean up a PC or repair the registry files and now I am down to but a few. Now don't be scared if you get overwhelmed by all of this. The program is extremly easy to use on most part. When you click the icon i running programs an overview comes up and it has either a green yellow or red mark telling you exactly what needs to be done, when it was done last time and it all happenst just by clicking the link in that same window. The user interface is VERY easy to use and even the most computer illiterate tells me that they love the program. Trust me, this will take good care of you. Also, if you end up one day with a need for computer repair, clean up, tune up, or rescueing, your Pc repairman will have all his tools right there and you don't need to purchase any additional software."
67014,0,"I found this software to provide much information about the vegetables one would grow in a garden, however, it doesn't seem practical. When you use the software to design your garden, It will put highest growing crops where they should be but doesn't seem to consider crops such as pumpkins and certain squashes that vine and stretch, into consideration. it would have you divide your crops in strange configurations and not take into consideration that the pumpkin (for instance), will grow into your other plants. Not exactly what I would call smart design. It has it's merits though, in it's information about plants. But when it comes down to laying out your garden, it needs a bit of help determining how plants grow outward, not just up ward!"
42838,1,"The interface has changed radically and it's taking me some time to find the correct menu item.

Then I had to download from Symantec website the symclean.exe and still there's files showing on my harddrive that won't let me install the upgrade. This system works is supposed to keep the system running smoothly, but how can it when you can't even get it installed."
89047,1,THANK GOD! That this product exist. We have an apple but also needed Windows XP and I was considering spending another $1300 in a dell labtop. But I did some research and called Apple who described this program and I read the reviews and thought for $250 I can get this program and Windows XP which will allow me to basically have two computers in one??? No way! But it was a no-brainer that I had to give it a shot and THANK GOD I did. I love it and so does my boyfriend. We only have 1GB and it runs just fine. It shares our printer and we just have nothing but the best too say about Parallells Desktop 3.0 for Mac!!!
22126,1,"The coverage for Mexico City surprised me - it's really complete, most methods of finding a place work great. Highways and major roads are well covered in Central Mexico, too.

33902,1,"A business associate turned me onto this product for my agency. Having never used the program I was skeptical. I originally bought the other version of Paperport also called Paperport 10 but not ""Professional"" Upon investigation it became clear that I made the wrong choice in my attempts to get by on the ""cheap"", so I decided to return the first copy and to go all out and get the professional version. I also decided I needed a new scanner to work with Windows XP. Mine was old and didn't have a document feeder. Let me tell you, sometimes change is good! After getting used to doing things the paperless way I soon discovered that this program is totally fantastic. One note of advice. If you work with PDF files then you MUST have the ""Professional"" version. I can't even begin to detail all the new and better ways I have discovered to work. There is a utility called Scan Direct that is great, it comes with another utility called PDF Creater that I cannot live without. I have since decided to get Omnipage and now I can scan in a file to Paperport and convert it to an editable Word document. The whole thing has changed the way I work. I subsequently purchased two more copies for the other workstations that don't even have a scanner. I highly recommend it."
40718,1,"I bought this package primarily for my 14 year old highschool freshman, but my 8 year old 2nd grader has also been using it. Certainly the best learning aide I've seen. Great research features displaying results from both the encyclopedia and the web. The online math tools include a link that let's you pick the students course book. Once set up you can go to any review item by chapter and page and read a detailed explanantion of the question just with different numbers than in the book. It has almost eliminated the time I have to spend with him on his math homework. My 2nd grader loves the kids encyclopedia and browsing information on nature and science and even my 5 year old has been looking at the pictures and photo galleries.They all seem to have fun using the software, which is certainly preferable to playing video games.Even though I'm not even close to having explored all the features, whatever I've seen so far is outstanding. It's defintely worth every penny."
54532,1,"Works well in the Etrex Legend, and is acceptable for those using a handheld for hiking, mountain biking, atv riders, or hunters. The area you are using will have to be downloaded into your unit, and in my case (an Etrex Legend) I could only load a two county area. So keep this in mind and plan your trip accordingly. The software performs well on my laptop as well as a desktop, and the quality of the USGS maps is good compared to other sources. A trip to the local sporting goods stores revealed that the price varies from 50.00 usd to 145.00 usd so shrewd shoppers can find a great deal with a little effort. Be sure to register your GPS unit and software in case you encounter any problems. (Garmin offers a restore on their website for registered units) A good product for those who enjoy scouting areas and printing maps."

86572,0,"I was impressed with Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8, but version 9 is vastly improved in terms of speech recognition. Version 8 was excellent; perhaps in the 95% range. Version 9 comes very close to 100% right out of the box, without any special training.Nuance is clear about the product requirements. A processor faster than 1Ghz is required along with at least 1GB of RAM (with 512MB minimum free). At least 650 MB of drive space is required.Installation on a computer running Windows XP SP 2 was entirely uneventful. Setting NaturallySpeaking v9 up with two different microphones was a snap. Recognition in a variety of applications was literally 100% without any training. It was, in fact, amazing. Setting the program up to run with a digital voice recorder, however, didn't go so smoothly - and that's why my rating is only 3 stars for what technologically is a 5 star product.Nuance's tech support is absolutely awful. They charge $ 9.95 even for an e-mail response, which they call an ""incident."" The manual has virtually no information on troubleshooting. Their online knowledgebase is not well indexed. Or, more accurately, they are running it on a particularly poor platform. Their user community is sparsely used and a lot of the information is useless.Nuance should learn that turning out a superior product isn't enough. It has to be supported competently as well and it is here that Nuance falls flat on its face.On the other hand, I recognize that the product is working with two microphones and hopefully I will find the answer to my problem somewhere, some day. As a long-time (and long-suffering) voice recognition software user, I will say the accuracy of NaturallySpeaking 9 is phenomenal. Only the support stinks.Jerry"

(The school district purchased around 50) The students were able to apply measuring skills as well as design principles due to its feature of preparing a virtual model. This was very helpful until the virtual model (based on the student's measurements) shed all of her clothes. She was anatomically correct with all of the features of a nude adult female . The males in the class suddenly became very motivated to assist their female classmates while the females turned their screens to the wall, thinking this was a standard part of the software. Many had put their pictures on the model to further personalize the model. I was especially shocked when the manufacturer was clueless regarding this surprise feature. Watch out!"

Its Microsoft certified for Windows 2000 a big seller in my opinion, give's me a secure feeling that my data isnt going to be messed up by defragging. But what really sold me is my system performance improved, it cut my boot time by 20 seconds. I highly recommend this software."

RadioTime (I think that's the name of the company and product) ingeniously designed this more like a radio guide instead of a cheap recorder software like the Replay Radio I previously purchased. You should try it because the real value comes from this radio guide."

It makes your children so happy, they begin to roar, and grown at you.I hear them sing (to the toon of a little bit of this a little bit of that) A little bit of apes, throw in some monkeys too! A little bit of that, it's all up to you! They wear red undies , It is funny too! And on and on with more detail about the ape and how they are animals in the great big circle of life.

32841,1,See my reviews under the Family Tree Maker 8.0 Deluxe 24-CD Set and 35-CD Set. This is the same as the 35-CD set with the addition of World Family Tree Vols 43-49. So you get the these WFT CDs for the difference in price.
52192,2,"This is my first Amazon review, but I just had to chime in with others who have used Quicken for 10+years now because I am so frustrated with this version. My entire financial life is in Quicken Mac, and I am SO unhappy that I upgraded to 2003. My 12MB file with the last 10+ years of my life (loans, investments, credit cards, rental properties, etc. -- probably one of the larger Quicken files around) is at risk. You can't go back once you upgrade. Save yourself the aggravation, and wait for something better than 2003, unless you really don't mind starting over from scratch if things get hosed.I have a G4 and a PC. The two primary things I still do (only) on the Mac are Quicken and iPhoto, and I feel locked-in to both programs. However, I'm *very* seriously considering dumping Quicken 2003 for Mac and moving to the Quicken for Windows. I *never* thought I'd ever do that, but this version of Quicken continues to annoy me every time I use it. Worse, it is starting to make me question the validity of my data.It crashes doing simple QuickReports (inexcusable), there are countless UI bugs like when hopping from one transaction to another or scrolling, there's no way to see the list of downloaded transactions once you've reconciled (as there was in previous versions), and loading my United Mileage Plus credit card transactions is more painful than ever as of Q2003: The browser link that Quicken launches is obsolete, meaning I have to manually log in. Then I have to manually enter the download dates, save to a .QFX file, and manually import that into Quicken (since downloading that file no longer auto-imports it into Quicken). In addition, it is darn near impossible to get some banking transactions to ""match up"" with entries I already have in my register. I've never been able to figure out why, but I end up accepting the downloaded transaction and deleting the one I entered (or one that was auto-entered as a scheduled transaction) because Quicken refuses to acknowledge that they're the same transaction. This is especially annoying for loan-related transactions. Investment tracking is also messed up. Capital gains reports are inaccurate (forcing me to re-enter everything manually in Excel at tax time) -- just moving shares from one brokerage to another resets the purchase date and throws off short/long term calculations. In addition, some of my mutual fund transactions seem to be missing (despite my reconciling each and every statement), leaving my Schwab register hopelessly unreconcileable. Finally, Quicken has NEVER handled employee stock option or employee stock purchase plan transactions (with the funky withholding that goes along with them) very well. I have to wonder if anyone at Intuit has ever tried to enter their own stock transactions.Switching to Windows won't be easy or fun. Intuit's suggestion is to simply ""export everything to QIF and re-import on the other side"". However, there are so many things that don't export that you're guaranteed a mess after you import the QIF files (like account to account transactions, as I recall). I fear I'm going to have to write off my 10 years of data, maybe export my banking and credit card transactions (just to maintain the history), fudge the balances to get a good starting point, and then gradually start over. With over 50 active accounts, this will not be easy or fun and I resent having to waste the time to do it. The only plus is that I've tried to simplify my life and I won't have to bother entering old data from old (hidden) accounts that are no longer in use.Intuit NEEDS to create a migration tool (Mac to Win or Win to Mac, as I've seen reviews from people who have tried to go either way) that seamlessly translates one format to the other without losing any data. In addition, a repair utility would be very welcome. With all of the crashes I've encountered, I'm sure there are problems in my data file. However, there is no way to validate or repair a Quicken file short of exporting and re-importing, and as already mentioned you're probably better off starting over from scratch.I, too, have beta tested Quicken Mac in the past (and presented bugs to Intuit some of which were even fixed, as well as done user experience testing for Intuit), but this is a tough program to test with real-life data. The 2003 beta program (like other recent ones) required a one-way upgrade to the new format, and suggested that you keep both the old and new versions up to date with the same transactions. I couldn't understand HOW to do this when downloading online transactions (and especially with regard to making online payments), and they offered no help on the matter. So, I guess I partially blame myself for not being more active in this beta and providing more feedback. Somehow, I doubt it would've made a difference.Adopting a program like this, for some of us, is a serious proposition. Not having a way out (e.g. migration to the presumably more stable and better maintained Windows version) is a real shame.As a software engineer, I understand that deadlines are often more important (to a company with an annual release schedule) than quality and sometimes it means bugs are often deferred (or maybe not even found). It's unfortunate that that really seems to have been the case with Quicken Mac 2003.I wish there was a more direct line of communication (for reporting and resolving bugs) with the company for those of us who are serious heavy-duty users of this software. If you're one of those people, you should avoid Quicken 2003 for Mac.UPDATE 9/24/03: The early reports seem to indicate that Quicken Mac 2004 is no better than 2003. I've since purchased Quicken Windows 2004 and am trying to figure out just how much of my data I'm going to attempt to migrate (vs. leaving behind forever on the Mac). It all comes down to how much time I want to spend massaging, re-typing, and reconciling my transactions, one miserable account at a time..."
39532,1,"Deus Ex was the game that steered me away from FPS and toward RPG. Indeed, Deus Ex was way ahead of its time; one of those games that merge two genres almost seamlessly (RPG and FPS). By 2007 standard, graphic will look somewhat dated, but gameplay still rocks, whether you chose to run and gun or sneak and peak, Deus Ex offers multiple paths to complete objectives.On top of the outstanding gameplay, Deus Ex serves up tons of sci-fi elements mixed in with heavy doses of conspiracy theories. Indeed, playing Deus Ex can feel like immersing yourself in a noirish/cyber-funk/sci-fi novel rather than playing a game.Deus Ex is not perfect (which is good, because personally, I will have a hard time living in the ""real world"" after playing the perfect game) ie. enemies AI could be better. Sound-wise, music and voice acting is good, but most of the weapons sound weak. Also, the main quest is somewhat linear - I wish you have a choice of which faction to side with. However, there are 3 different endinds depend on the choice you make, and trust me, if you get this far, you'll do all 3 because the game intrigues you so much.After all these times, Deus Ex is still in a class by itself. I can only think of 1 other game with sci-fi themed FPS/RPG elements that might come close to Deus Ex: System Shock 2. Therefore, if you want an alternative from the fantasy themed dungeon and dragon type RPG games - Deus Ex is the game to play.Other good sci-fi RPG games that I also recommend after Deus Ex: Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic series, System Shock 2, and Fallout series. If you know any other good sci-fi RPG games, please let me know.PS. Although listed for Windows 98 & ME, Deus Ex runs flawlessly on XP."
55716,1,"I am rather new to the product of Poser having a demo of Poser 4 Pro Pack. I was unaware of the powers that Poser possessed until I purchased Poser 6.This program is incredible, basically Poser 6 allows the creation and manipulation of human figures and animal models. You can change every property of theses figures from resizing to deforming. Poser 6 allows you to build scenes using various props like chairs etc plus you can build your own by combining various shapes which you can then texture.There is face modeling tool which allows you to model a side image and front image of a person and place them on to a 3D model head.Using the animation tools you can create animation to bring your creations to life, add sound effects to give your animation greater realism.This program is full pack with great features, and believe it or not getting to know how to use this program is quite easy and anyone can create realistic results in no time at all."
65867,1,Very happy with this item ... cant say anything bad about it. My son is learning sounds of letters and counting . Perfect for preparing for Kindergarten.
57488,1,"I was reluctant to buy PC-Cillin because it wasn't as well known as McAfee or Norton. But I gave it a try since I wasn't happy with either of the 'big two'.I have had PC-Cillin for over a year now and it works great. It is easy to install and configure, scheduling is a breeze and updates are regular and smooth.I have had no ""runaway"" viruses for a year but I know that they are still out there. Every so often PC-Cillin finds one and gets rid of it before it can do any damage. So I know it is doing the job. I have no complaints at all.One feature that I especially like is the ability to block certain sites entirely. Domains like ""tribalfusion"" are a pain since they can load pop up windows despite good anti-pop up software. PC-Cillin protects you against that by giving you the option to block certain domains entirely. For instance, I blocked tribalfusion entirely and eliminated their pop up windows completely.Overall, I am very pleased and highly recommend the product."
57717,1,"InDesign CS is perhaps the application that benefited most from the most recent upgrade that Adobe made to its key applications, bringing a load of useful and highly expected features. I'd like to stress ONE feature, though, that blew me away... two words: NESTED STYLES. If you have suffered through the painful process of laying out a document where more than two styles are required in a particular content block, you will shed tears of joy when you see this at work!You are bound to also find very handy the enhanced table features such as automated running headers and footers for tables that run across multiple linked text frames. Printers (people in the printing industry) are also going to be happy (or so Adobe wants) with the features that have been included in InDesign CS for them.All in all, if I were Quark, I'd be shaking because InDesign is not going to stop until it takes over the current market share that QuarkXpress has... it's just a matter of time and perhaps a version or two more. But try CS now: I think you will love it!"
6816,1,"I hesitated to buy this series because version 7 had such BAD reviews. They must have improved with version 8. This is great practice. Using the speaker, you get constant feedback at how well you are pronouncing the words. You can see it in various ways - your tone, accent, pitch, etc. But I must mention that this isn't for the absolute beginner. You don't actually learn proper sentence structure, etc. YOu MUST first take a class or learn through the various language tapes. I had taken a semester of Italian in college and prior to that briefly skimmed the Living Language Audio cassettes. The software is simply a tool to PRACTICE what you've learned.There are a variety of lessons: 1) a video dialogue; 2)Conversation phrases; 3) Fundamental Italian; &amp; 4) Survival Phrases. But they really lack in organization. Don't bother going to their HELP menu. It's generic. It isn't unique to the language you choose. It's the standard throughout the entire series. I know there is a grammer help somewhere. But again, because it isn't at all organized, I can't find it again. Don't bother with the button &quot;Getting Started.&quot; IT doesn't lead you to a nice step-by-step guide.But I still recommend it for those who've at least learned the language elsewhere. I tried the French one- which just proves my point. My knowledge of French is less then what I know of Italian. I was lost, because I really didn't know it. But at least I can HEAR if I can pronounce the words."
17557,1,"Pros: Good, well contructed, colorimeter for the novice, easy to use software walks you through every step. I notice a definite improvement in my new 22"" WS LCD's picture. I had tried Adobe Gamma and Quick Gamma, but these programs rely on your eyes for making brightness and contrast corrections, and setting gamma. My eyes are not as sharp as they were 20 years ago.Cons: The new updated software, version 2.3, has been out since June, 2006 but Colorvision is still shipping with the older version. Go to their website [...]), download 2.3 (110.3 MB), install it, and use the keycode on your 2.2 version to run it. The 2.3 version changes the target white point for LCDs to 6500K instead of Native. I personally prefer 6500k anyway. Gamma 2.2 and 6500K are the only choices with the Express. If you want more choices you will have to purchase the more expensive Pro version.After calibration and exiting the software I got a ""Can not find color profile"" error message. Rebooting solved this.With the counter-weight adjusted, I still had to tilt my LCD monitor back 15 - 20 degrees before I could get the Spyder to lay completely flat on the screen."
28455,1,"I cant say enough about this software...During crashes or accidental downloads.I have been able to remove some malware programs,without problems Most recently,i had a virus,that could not be fully removed...I dont know how or why but the virus appears to be gone after running a window washer scan,with system restore off..I had followed all symantec instructions,but it didnt complete remove the threat.Perhaps window washer caught the cookie crums,who knows?...I highly recommend this product."
20790,1,This program is what I first learned type on it taught me so well that in 3 days I went from not being able to type at all to typing at 20 wpm with all of the characters. This program has a great interface. I especially like it's status tracker. Even if it wasn't so cheap I would still recommend it.
26438,0,I have buffer underrun protection on my CD burner yet this product fails with underrun errors every time.
94163,1,I have had no problems running Easy CD Creator on my computer. I'm running Windows ME and it seems to work with no problems. When I fist set it up I found my CD burner wasn't supported but a quick download later I was up and running.I have mainly used it for archiving family digital pictures and it has worked flawlessly! Easy to use interface and fast burn times even with an older system like mine (AMD K6-2.)I have also made a couple of music CDs and again no problems and easy to use interface. I also burned some of the digital movies I took using my digital camera and they play without fail in our DVD player.
76326,1,"If you keep good accounting records and have the patients to follow all the steps, this is a very worthwhile program. The only cons are that you can't update each year - You have to buy the new version, and e-filing is extra. Although, my federal refund came in a very short time so the extra charge was worth it for me."
62895,1,"I was looking for a really simple way to track my workouts. Sometimes I create my own workouts, sometimes I copy them in from magazines. FitSync is great! It's real easy to track on my PDA and then it uploads to the Web where I can see all kinds of cool charts and stuff. They also have a huge library of exericse videos and workouts on the web. It's pretty cool. I love it. Check it out."
17802,1,"This Seminar style DVD is fantastic for anyone interested in learning Sony Acid Pro version 6. This DVD package covers every aspect for Sony's software from real studio multi tracking, to the ins in outs of basic and advanced midi editing/recording. It also covers the features of what made Acid famous in previous versions of the software; the loop based functions.This package comes with 4 discs. The first disc is nothing but a demo disc with all of Sony's popular audio/video programs. These are only free trials or demo versions, and having the full versions of most the software that was on the disc, I didn't check it out much.Discs 2 and 3 are DVD video discs that can be played in any home DVD player, or on your pc. They recommend watching it on your home DVD player, as the 4th disc is called the ""companion disc"". This disc is a CD-ROM data disc that contains all the files featured in the 2 DVD video presentations, so you can copy them to your computer's hard drive and follow along with the instructor on DVDs and learn how to use Acid fluently.Now, I myself have used Acid a lot before, and was just hoping what I was doing was the right way to use the features I was going for. I have watched the DVDs, and so far learned many things I didn't know acid was capable of, but also learned that there are faster/easier ways to do the things I have been going for. This package, like I stated above, covers every aspect of the program and how to use it.Sony not only made the Acid Pro 6 software, but this very DVD package came from Sony's studios and was created by the people who designed the program. So you're getting the best training with this package.However, I would not recommend this product for novice PC users who don't have much experience with audio. I worked with Acid without this DVD package for months and got somewhat use to it, along with reading PC recording books, asking questions on forums, ect. So again, I would only recommend this DVD package for users who know a little (or a lot) about pro audio and PCs because this package only covers Acid as a program, and not all the PC bells and whistles needed to run it.If you have never used Acid before, I would recommend opening the program up and play around with it a little before using this training DVD. The instructor moves along pretty fast through all the training ""classes"" and you will find yourself pausing and playing back sections very frequently if you don't know much about Acid. They go through the sections pretty fast, but if you know Acid somewhat, you can follow along with them pretty easy. The best thing to do, is watch the DVDs through once, and then try the tricks in Acid. And if there is a few things you can't remember how to do, just bust out the training DVDs again and review them.I was so impressed with this package, then I went ahead and bought the other seminar DVDs for the other programs I have from Sony. These are fantastic.Overall, this was defiantly worth my money and has shown me way more then I expected. Don't let the jargen fool you... you DON'T need pro tools... Acid Pro 6, with all the updates, is a full Digital Audio Work Station."
68505,1,This looks like a product that will help edit pictures very well. I haven't personally had time to work with it yet.
88444,1,"I was astounded with watching my little 2 year old run the mouse, with such ease too! This program is great for getting little ones comfortable with the computer. The games are fun, especially, &quot;Open the Present&quot;! My daughter is ready to go on to more difficult programs thanks to &quot;Baby and Me&quot;!"
17621,2,"I purchased this by download from Ulead's site. The program wouldn't recognize my Cd burner (Roxio Easy CD worked fine, but didn't do what I wanted to do with photos). I emailed tech support and got a response a week later saying that they didn't have an answer and needed more time. That's been about 3 weeks ago and I never got a response. Look and see how many people complain about the program not working on Ulead's message board before you buy this. I should have tried the trial version first, but I checked and the site said it supported my drive, OS, etc."
40056,1,"As soon as I got the software installed it ran fine. All I really had to do was a few software updates to iMovie for it to work on my OS. My only real gripe with this purchase was how long it took to receive the package, other than that, everything was perfect and im currently using the software without a hitch."
57844,1,"What's not to like?It's cheaper that TurboTax, and does the same thing. Imports from financial software, does an ""interview-style"" return, imports last year's info, the usual stuff. Also allows e-file (you pay extra) and will support EFT to/from the IRS-- if you owe them money, you can have it sent on 4/15/04 and not pay any sooner than you need to.My return is complex, but it handled it well. Just as good as the competitor, and about five bucks less. Also a great rebate offer w/ MSFT Money; basically get Money '04 for free. I'm sold, I'm satisifed, and I'll be back next year.Four starts since it's just bare bones, but at this price, what do you want? I say don't bother paying for the extra movies and advisor stuff."
67912,1,"This is surely a step up from the Printmaster 10 that I've been using for years. I downlowded the entire program on my hard drive, so there is no switching CDs every time you want to add a new image...fabulous! That makes it ten times quicker! Lots of images to use from the CDs and the use of images from the internet is very easy. I love to make cards,newsletters, fliers, etc... I would recommend it for anyone who wants a simple but creative card program."
25038,1,"Was using the previous version, when one day I noticed a banner display on my Spyware X-terminator program display that mentioned a free update to version 2005. So I jumped on the deal.I like the updated interface design.The program found several items that other scanners had missed.The new version adds colored dots [buttons?] that indicate the severity of the item it found, from LOW to HIGH, and also an UNKNOWN.I've only tried it a few times. Since the 1st run through one's pc really cleans things up, it's hard to compare it directly to another anti-sppware cleaner.[What I should have done was to run it ONLY to DETECT the ""mal-ware"" and then ran my other anti-spy programs and compared]:-items found-items missed [if any]-etcBut I didn't.All things considered, my 2 favorites are:1. Webroot spy-sweeper2. Spyware Xterminator 2005"

16963,2,I donloaded Norton Utilities 2002 a week ago. The product I received was Norton AntiVirus 2002. As of today I still haven't got anywhere getting this corrected by Amazon!! Don't waste your money on this download!!Buyer Beware!!
70838,1,"This is a great product. I had a massive move to make, and it worked. Use the cable that comes with the kit- other cables won't work. I wouldn't use a network, since networks can be buggy. You should have more than basic computer skills. I had a few programs that wouldn't work at first on the new computer, but I expected that. The program's wizard warns of this possibility. This is not a data problem, but seems to be a protective device. It took me about an hour of tweaking, and there's a handy utility that allows you to activate or suppress program functions that may be causing problems. I'm very happy to have all my valuable software and data files working 100% on my new, faster machine."
5792,0,"After installing Taxcut Platinum for Home and Business on my &quot;D:&quot; drive and spending 2 hours downloading the updates and getting started on doing the taxes, I attempted to install the Taxcut State edition. However it only installs to the C: drive.Imagine a billion dollar company which forces you to install its products on only the C: drive. Small bug? Slight programming problem? So now to get it to work, I have to reinstall the whole thing (TaxCut for home and Business) on my C: drive and download the updates again, where I don't have room (that's why I have D, E, F,... drives). Another evening of installing and downloading spent because of the programming weirdness of Tax Cut. Last year and the year before I had to get them to send me new CD's because the ones they sent me had R/W errors on them, and were unusable.I called their help desk and they didn't see anything odd about their unique installation - forcing the user to install to the C: drive.Thank God, there's some competition for these guys or this program would be a lot worse.Once you get it installed, it seems to work fine. In fact I love the program. So I give it a &quot;5&quot; for being great program, but a &quot;1&quot; for the annual installation problems."
76979,1,"This little SD card saved our vacation. Typically we tend to rely on maps and self navigation, and it makes for a tense vacation when we're arguing over roads that aren't there, places that are impossible to find, etc. This time, we bought the SD card for my Garmin nuvi 660. This little gem got us to the most remote areas of southern England imaginable! Not one of our coastal locations was a problem to find. In one case, we stayed in a ""town"" that was literally three houses amid the moors. No road signs, one-lane roads, and no problem at all with this map! It's worth every cent. We found another retailer who sold it for much much less, but knowing what I know now, I'd not hesitate to pay what retailers here are asking for it!"
72671,1,"This product was exactly what I had hoped for. I didn't think I would be able to get my pictures off the memory card, but I was able to with this product. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
60914,1,"IF you can keep your wife from talking too much in the background, you will learn quite a bit of Italian. Better yet, use headphones and put a sign on your back that you are trying to learn the language so that she won't be eating strange food like pig intestines when you get there. Otherwise, you will learn quickly, but there is a big leap between the beginner cd and the intermediate one. That's okay because you will have to wade into using Italian once you get there. It's worth the purchase."
51549,1,"This studio is leagues beyond the last. Microsoft is easing the burden of developers by simplifying distributed application development using .NET. Sure, for instance, you can go in and manually write the low level COM interface connectors if you prefer to have the &quot;stick shift&quot; control and specific performance attributes etc., or you can rely on the built in functionality of .NET and speed the development process.It seems that with this platform there is a bit of a learning curve even for the most experienced developers because of the great differences. But the online help is dynamic and useful when you get stuck on something.Visual Basic is not Visual Basic now. They seemed to have completely renovated the way VB works.The Common language Runtime (CLR) makes it possible to create solutions by interweaving any of the languages included with the studio. I believe there is a way to import 3rd party or future MS designed languages as well. So if one language is better at a specific task, then you can switch to it.The integrated development environment (IDE) is meant to maximize developer productivity. In using it, I haven't experienced the contrary. I must mention that I do like the flexibility of working on web applications in .NET. You can use a grid layout like a form builder, or the flow layout like a web page editor.I noticed a couple of funny things so far, but not worth mentioning. It takes some getting used to, but this is certainly worth it."
47501,0,I don't have any trouble with the software. I did however copy the data cd to my laptops hard drive using Virtual Drive. The only reason I gave it only 3 stars is that I think the maps do need to be updated.
7826,1,"I got an Acer laptop with Vista Ultimate pre-installed and a Norton trial. The Norton was bothersome with it's incorrect nagging and even crashing. Symantec support had a new version but on download I lost the 90-day trial period. So I decided to try OneCare since I know it's Vista ready. Honestly I have had zero problems with this product. It works without bugging you about settings and prompts when it does something in the background (like changing your firewall when on an unsecured network). It reminds you to back-up, and updates itself. If you need to share media, one click in the firewall settings shares the proper ports. On my XP machine I still use McAfee, but when the subscription expires I think I'll standardize on OneCare."
77599,1,"Microsoft has outdone themselves this year by offering Money 2002 Deluxe, H&amp;R Block's TaxCut Tax Preparation Software, and a practical Home Legal Help software in one package. These items bought independently would cost much more than the advertised prices, plus if you already own a previous edition of Microsoft Money, you can get a $20 rebate! Now that's value. Most reviews up to this point by professional magazines and newspapers rate Quicken and Money very evenly against each other, but Microsoft Money more seamlessly intergrates with the Internet Explorer Browser, the Windows operating system, and most features that every computer has standard these days. I have used both in the past and Money wins the ease of use award in my personal opinion. The Best Personal Finance Software just got Better!"
35401,1,I love this Japanese software because it's very cool! I really love the audio CD's because they're helping me learn more words. The collest thing about this software is you can practice your speaking skills and choose a level you're on. That's awesome! I really love this software because it's helping me learn Japanese!
10031,0,"My old copy of this game gave up the ghost so I went to Amazon's sellers and bought another for a very good price. This doesn't always play very will with os Vista, and then I upgraded to Windows 7 and it doesn't play very well with that either. If you right click the icon and choose ""play as administrator"" I did get it to work with vista and windows 7. But I use it mainly with my little 10"" that is installed with xp. One time the the game froze on me but it played well all the other times. And sometimes it takes a while to start up, but that could be my external cdrom drive which isn't very fast. I love this game. It reminds of times playing the board game with my family when I was a child. It is very similar with some interesting graphics and little video segments. If you loved this as a child (or adult!) you will enjoy this game."
3807,1,"I've been aching to do something about my photos and found this program to be the answer. Photo editing wasn't enough, I needed an archiving program tool. This photo software is as good as any that I've tried before. You know the drill, there is the cropping tool, resizing, tint/hue adjustment, special effects. This also has the layer editing mode which lets you play around more with the photo. You can edit in layers and dump the ones you don't like wihtout affecting other edits.The archiving modes has good choices. You can organize photos in an album, collage, or slide show. I've tried all the options and all of them are good. Since I want to save the photos in as high a quality image as possible, the photo sizes are big. That leads me to the disc burning. I've left a rewritable dvd in my drive as back up. You can use the quick disk manager which can reside in memory. Just choose the files and drag them to the disk icon. The other option to use is to burn giveaway discs. I've used the cd, dvd-pc, and dvd player formats. It's a good solution package."
41008,1,"I've seen that a lot of people have given this game a not very good review but i loved it. it was very time consuming and addictive, but once i got into it and realized different tips and strategies of playing, it was so much fun. i especially like that you can find a million places on the net to d/l new things for the game. great game, especially for only 19.99, i paid almost double that."
32689,1,"This product is what it is. It isn't a fully detailed set of maps with every contour line and building on it. It is a basic set of TOPO maps that shows most local roads. What do you want for under $100 for a set of maps that covers the entire USA? It doesn't have every street name, the water maps are a little sparce, and some of the feature names are dated. I bought, I like it, I use it for what it is good for.Bottom line is that this is a tool like any other. You wouldn't build a car engine with nothing but a $5 pair of pliers but you could. You can mow your entire lawn with a $29 string trimer but you wouldn't. This is a basic $100 set of maps of the entire united states, for the price you can't beat the detail.If I had it to do over again I would still buy TOPO USA because it works for me."
46429,0,"The maps are OK, they scanned the paper maps and that it's about it, no enhancements, no grid correction. If you want to print maps that share two UTM quadrants you will end up with a messy UTM grid. The other problems with printing are scale and resolution. You can print only one page at the time, there is no such thing like select the area that you want to print and the scale and let the software do the page distribution on a given page size. When you want to print a map the software will &quot;suggest&quot; a scale, that scale is really something, no 1:24000, no 1:25000 is more like printing a picture that a map, however you can choose a custom scale and set to 1:24000 but then the printing quality is gone. The font on the printed map borders can not be selected and scale with the map, that means you will end up with a bigger font on a 1:24000 map than on a 1:25000 map."
62819,1,"The immersive approach to building vocabulary and listening skills -- basically showing you pictures and making you associate them with spoken phrases -- is fun and works beautifully. The first time you walk through a lesson, you feel as if you're guessing and you get about 45% right ... but the second time through you're at 80%, and if you go through a third time you're geting nearly everything right. They're pretty artful about communicating subtle ideas in pictures -- they get past/present/future tense across very clearly, for instance.I'm less sure thus far about the approach to learning reading and writing skills, which is similar to the listening drills -- you're associating images or spoken words with sets of glyphs without any drilling in the alphabet. I've made progress on recognizing many words and am starting to puzzle out the alphabet myself, but have a long way to go on this.Overall, if you want to get quickly to the point where you can conduct a conversation with Hindi-speakers or travel in India, this software in combination with some subtitled Bollywood movies is probably the fastest and most enjoyable way to get there."

With just minimal adjustments, I was able to remove all of the above from old and battered 33s and 78s that I transfer to CD using my beloved ION TTUSB turntable. These two products are the best money I've ever spent to save my favorite music. Unbeatable!"
41797,1,The activities in this software are exciting and fun for a child as young as 2 1/2 years old. Children choose from 6 types of activities that hold their interest. The objects move when they are selected and the animation is life-like and fun to watch. This is an excellent choice if you are looking for your child's first software program.
55625,2,"I was very disappointed by the skimpy list of plants included. No spruce, no oakleaf hydrangea, no privet, no epimedium. Only a few kinds of hosta, nowhere near the great variety of colors and sizes easily available.Any landscape designed with this program will be poor and boring, indeed. The plants that are provided are so overly common."
2996,1,"One of my two tied favorite Nancy Drew games, this is a game for everyone. You, as Nancy, are visiting a friend, when two things happen- a tree falls behind your car, meaning you can't leave, and the friend insn't home. She calls from her car, but breaks up, leaving you to wonder just what she meant by Malone's dogs...Basically, you need to figure out just what is going on with the ghost dogs. Are they real dogs, belonging to a cunning criminal? Or are they truly the dogs of a long dead ganster, trying to keep everyone away from his house-- the house you're staying in?This game has many cool features such as some of the best graphics I've ever seen, calling friends (Bess and George) for tips, and a second chance feature that allows you to continue from right before you goofed.I recomend this challenging game to anyone, boy or girl, kid or adult, who enjoys a good mystery and a minimal violence, educational-value game."
1739,0,"The GPS took a while to find the correct location when turned on the first time. Unlike even the simplest Garmin, there is no indication what the GPS error might be. But then the GPS worked amazingly well, even in the streets of Manhattan (when driving, not when turned on in a stationary location between tall buildings).The directions are sometimes wrong (""turn left"" while you actually have to ""take a ramp right""...). Worse, the progran uses a different language than the highway signs and says things like ""turn left on I-999"" instead of ""turn on I-999 South"" (which may require going right first...). Particularly at complicated interchanges something like ""follow route 99"" might be less error prone.The program makes one type addresses to find destinations instead of just clicking on a place, and fuss with the mouse switching between the map and the rest of the interface, which is outright dangerous when driving and annoying at any time.The database of places is rather incomplete. There does not seem to be any online update."
19863,1,"I've always liked Nancy Drew games, and this one is my 2nd favorite. It is challenging, yet not frustrating and confusing. I would say that it is for ages 9-11. The graphics are great, and unlike most Nancy Drew games, it is a little simpler. Danger on Deception Island is great and fun with tons of &quot;seaworthy&quot; suprises.In the game there is an orphan killer whale who swam into the San Juan Islands in Washington. You are staying with a marine biologist named Katie. She wanted the whale to be tested in a lab, but the other suspects on the island want it to return to it's pod. Therefore, leading to the vandalism of Katies boat.This is a great game for junior detectives!"
62788,1,"I was worried, because Humongous hasn't put out any new Putt Putt or Pajama Sam games for a while, but now there are new ones of each, and they are just as wonderful as all the others. Pep's Birthday Surprise is very sweet, and very simple, but is extremely entertaining and funny. The characters are really cute, especially the big hippy VW Bus named ""Sunshine"". The game changes a bit each time you play it, so it remains entertaining and challenging. Also, there are tons of different things in each room to click on, as well as some really fun mini-games. I buy these games for my nephew, but I always end up playing them myself. Definitely a bargain for some of the best children's software you're likely to find anywhere."
55942,1,"There is so much new in this software from Dreamweaver 3.0 I could never list it all, but there are new extensions to easily allow you to intert, CGI, Java, Cold Fussion and much more. Rather than with Dreamweaver 3.0 you had to go to a totally different HTML editor to even insert all of those special features. The interface is the same, even though the menus are a bit more complex and confusing. One huge problem I have with it is that it seems to crash constantly, where I need to restart the computer. It also loses the website definitions that I have, so I must re-enter the definitions."
54162,1,Creator 6 is clean and a refreshing change from previous versions-all five main applications are just a click away. My personal favorite is DVD Builder-in a few minutes I was able to burn a movie from my raw video and play it in my DVD player.
6636,1,"For years I have been addicted to the Mac Computer in its various forms. Apple Works, Microsoft Works was my choice of word processors. Then I tried Microsoft Word beginning with 1998. When Microsoft Word 2004 came out, I considered upgrading. Finally with MacBook Pro, I took the refreshing plunge! What a joy to click on the blue M and know I will have a document that IS quickly and easily professional and accurate. Communication has never been easier!"
75024,1,"This product is amazing! It is simplicity itself to use and facilitates the language learning process in a manner that makes the learning intuitive and fun. I had studied and used Russian, Czech, Latin, Greek, German and Hebrew during my life, but this is easiest system I've come across. I plan to use it to fortify my Russian and when I've worked through Spanish, branch out into other languages."
43618,1,This version of Office is a good basic grouping of the most used software. I would recommend it to anyone who is not trying to do super fancy advanced projects. It is licensed to put on 3 separate computers which is a plus.
24122,1,"We play many adult and child board and online games and I am not aware of a game that is more mentally stimulating while being pretty fun for a child. My daughter has been playing this since she turned 4 and continues to ask for this series two years later. I am not sure that one needs to have all of the games from the series, since many of the puzzles are based on the same type of logic, but I feel that every child should own a copy of one. Since the puzzles offer four levels of difficulty, most of them would be challenging for the average adult. The great replay value will help boost a child's analytical skills to a point that many of their school tasks become trivial."
86401,0,"Pros:Reason is a awsome way get a professional sound from your synth music quick. It includes some of the best sounds, synth, samples, and effects there are. The midi recording and automation options are exellent. You can self-contain your files, export to 24-bit or 16-bit audio, export as a midi, or publish the file for sharing. It is also compatible with tons of different midi keyboards.Cons:Not much is compatible with the program plugin wise. The instruments you get with the program is all you get. The Real Time effects while great quailty are not vast. And as far as i know any sort of plugin cost way too much. Most the refills are either extremely wack or a little too expensive. Importing audio can only be done in a sampler so if your audio file is long you have to restart from the beginning to hear it (not real time).All in all I still use this program to this day and consider it one of the best there is. But you make the call. I would try this and Ableton Live and decide which you perfer."
80270,1,"Not sure what program the other users are using, but I'm a longtime Photoshop user; since ver. 2.5, the first PC version and while CS3 isn't the biggest or best upgrade to date, it isn't bad either. It has a lot of very handy new features and refinements. I can go literally for months and never get a single crash in Photoshop, it is by far the most stable application I've ever used in Windows. Plugins I purchased almost 10 years ago STILL WORK. Its a shame the previous review doesn't detail any of his so called 'bugs', I'd be happy to offer tech support as I would more than likely blame user error in this care. The panorama stitching, and HDR/32 bit image support are worth the upgrade alone! Highly recommended."
20995,1,"Oh I LOVED playing this online, BUT I only could play the 1hour trial, so I bought the game, LOVE IT! Addicting!! I think I beat it in 2 sittings! LOL"

36574,1,"I thought this entire pack was quite fun and very cheap compared to buying everything sepratley. (Sorry im not a good speller.) Sim life has so many variables, Theme park you can have a very funny time, Theme hospital is almost addicting,and the rest are fun as every now and then games. Plus buing all else is over 30$. Thanx for listinging to me ramble."
69483,0,"I recently received this software and find it to be similar to several other drawing programs that are available for free online. I suppose that this would be a good purchase for a child who absolutely loves drawing on the computer, but a child who is only occasionally interested in drawing programs, just stick to what's available for free online.I would also like to add that if you purchase this product from ccsoftare (as I did), do not expect to receive a newly packaged product. Instead, you may (as I did) receive just a CD-Rom in a paper envelope. Amazon's Condition Guidelines specifically state that any software being sold as ""New"" must come in an unopened package with a UPC symbol. This seller not only ignored this guideline, but was offensively flippant in his/her response to my negative review. I would not reccommend doing business with this seller."
91263,1,"I've used this software since finding it in a bargain bin at $7. At the time I figure it'd be a simple Windows recorder, since I'm a Mac guy who has Digital Performer. I didn't expect much.This stuff is AWESOME! Unlike the clumbersome Cakewalk, etc., this is set up the way a studio is set up, and works relatively intuitively. But most important are the sounds and effects. I recorded a rough demo on this software - THROUGH THE PINHOLE MIC in my laptop.... and it sounded good enough to let people hear!As to the MP3 encoding limitation: Hey, they hit you up for $15 upgrade to encode in mp3. Big deal. They already give you .wav files and other uncompressed options. Use iTunes' free built in encoder if you like, but as cheap as this software goes for, even at list well under $100, quit complaining about a lousy $15. Digital Performer is several hundreds more and they hit ya up every time they do an UpDATE as if it were an upGRADE.Bottom line? As someone else mentioned, this stuff is pro-quality algorhythms for a VERY discounted price. If you're crashing it, etc., figure out what you've got set up badly, what extra stuff you've got running, etc., because if an older laptop can run this without crashes, the sofware wasn't the problem.ENJOY!"
15902,1,"I've used an earlier version of the suite, and it's helped many times to diagnose a failed component. The dealer is OK, and the price is GREAT !!"
79562,1,This version is a must to have when dealing with RAW format.I know there are other programs that deal with RAW but I like Adobe!I am very satisfied with it! A MUST!
89942,1,"I used Flash 5, and loved it! I heard about Flash MX, read several reviews (all positive), and decided to try it out. I don't regret my decision for a second.Flash MX is a great improvement over Flash 5 in many categories: design, usability, and power. Flash MX has been made much easier for the beginner to use, automating such things as scroll bar creation and button making. It retains incredible power, however, for the more advanced user. The interface has been made to look more like other Macromedia (and coincidentally Adobe) products, and navigation around the program is incredible! The product has the power to animate beyond your wildest dreams.Complicated animation becomes a breeze with Flash MX. You can cause your objects to morph into other objects, create motion trails, and much more with as few as two frames (Flash creates the rest). This is useful for rapidly creating animations, as well as enabling beginners to create animation.The learning curve for Flash can be steep, so I recommend you purchase a book for learning this program, but once you have learned a few basics you can easily animate.The other program, which does essentially the same thing, is Adobe LiveMotion. This program is a bit cheaper, but lacks the power of Flash MX. If you are looking to create webpages, animation, or web applications, Flash MX is the tool of choice. Try it, you will love it!"
28346,1,I do a lot of amature photography. I run older operating systems I had to restore my computer do to a virus. I had lost my old adobe disc. I was thrilled to get the one from you in excellant condition at a very good price. It arrived at my home a few days after I ordered it! Thanks again.
23671,1,"a good product overall. fun for the children to use.also used in school, allow creativity."
70601,1,"It's designed from the ground up using the 2008 build from Symantec. Norton360 takes up almost no system resources (254mb of ram with Windows XP).I put it on two slow Pentium 4 computers with Windows XP Pro and Home ---(3.02GHz, FSB533Mhz/Hyper-threading/PC2700 2x256mb ram)(3Ghz Northwood, FSB533Mhz/Hyper-threading/PC3200 2x512mb ram)---One Vista Ultimate computer(Core 2 Duo E6300, 2gb DDR2 PC5400 ram)and they all run extremely fast with zero bog down and no change in boot-up or shutdown times. Online back up of 2GBs is killer too. This is an amazing product that changes everything that was ever bad about Norton Products in the past 4 years. WONDERFUL JOB."

63772,1,After many dedicated years of using H&R block a friend told me to try turbo tax. It was very easy to install. It was even easier to use. The explanations helped me do a complicated tax form with ease. I started to freak out when it asked me to print forms and i did not have a printer. Guess what - you can save them as a pdf and print them anywhere. (...) Excellent all around service. Be aware that you will get charged to file electronically and for direct deposit. [...] :0)
91643,2,"ScanSoft PaperPort has the worst customer service of any software I have ever purchased. In addition, the user forums are weak and provide little help. I have also found this software to be particularly buggy and prone to developing problems, so the lack of support is especially aggravating."
43406,1,"Very happy with the price on this product as compared to brick & mortar retailers. This version (Home & Office Student)does not include MS Outlook, but the included Excel and Word packages have been updated and are more powerful. For my personal rant to software providers, I am annoyed when it takes me forever to figure out how to do things I used to do routinely. The 2007 version has been updated with the ""ribbon"", and in time I'm sure I'll get used to it... but I'm not there yet by a long shot."
61787,1,"I bought this to teach Word to my homeschool highschooler who is now writing research papers. We own the Macintosh version of Word and the product is geared towards Word on Windows, but it really was no problem since the screens are remarkably the same. I have been a Word user for over 10 years and learned a few new tricks with this product.The program is mostly a person talking while you watch animations of a word screen. As the voice describes the actions, you see typing in the Word document and the menus and widgets being manipulated. I usually opened my Word and worked along with the lesson. Lessons are organized into Units. Each unit has from 1 -13 lesson. You can choose which Units you wish to watch, in any order you choose. You can also choose any lesson you want within the Unit. This is nice because it meant we could avoid having to watch lessons on boring material (like how to print) and material we just don't need to know (like how to create a mail merge).The product includes manuals on PDFs. The manuals are organized the same as the program, each manual section matching a program Unit. Each section had three parts: 1. Recap of the video lesson with screen shots and text. 2. Summary of the actions learned in the Unit. 3. Exercises. We found the Exercises useful in reinforcing the lesson.My only complaint about the program is that it lacked a Unit on Styles, which I consider very basic to learning Word. I was forced to make my own lesson for that concept."
90634,1,Except for one or two things my experience with Microsoft Office Standard 2007 FULL VERSION has been good. The coolest part is the new interface. It takes some getting used to but it is worth it.

12410,1,"After reading a lot of these reviews I can see that a lot of people have no idea what they're talking about. For instance: one guy say's that in XP you have no controle over it what so ever.....this is purly BS because the fact of the matter is, what makes this program so great is the fact that you do have controle over everything right down to the smallest detail. True! You have to know what your doing, and you have to ""find"" the controls yourself they just don't jump out at you and say ""here I am"" but once you find the features of this OS you are in controle and I mean in ""FULL"" controle right down to even changing the log on screen ....(how many could do THAT in 98) I've been running my XP for about 4 months and not one time has it EVER crashed ....not once ...and I run one hell of a lot of programs plus I'm on a cable connection and down load well over a BILLION bites a month. The ONLY drawback that I've seen with this OS is the fact that it is a power hungry...in other words you have to have ""POWER"" to run it...that means plenty of memory(at least 228) a very fast procceor (600 or more)and a super fast memory card....(I have the all in one )if you don't have what it takes then of course you won't be happy with it. The very best advice I can give you is check out TechTV.com here is where you'll learn everything you need to know about computers and OS's (no matter what your running."
77126,1,"I purchased this add-on a few weeks before first driving over in the UK - Scotland to be exact (I'm from the US, never driven on the left-side of the road before). It arrived over a week before I left. I fiddled with it before I left the US. The only harrowing issue occurred when I first got off my plane in Edinburgh - my Garmin couldn't pick up a signal. Turns out that no GPS's pick up a signal right near the airport. By the time I got to the rental car, the signal was there, as were the Scottish roads and directions to my first destination. This add-on was fantastic - really essential and alleviated the stress of driving in the UK (especially the windy Scottish countryside) for the first-time. Perfect for roundabouts if you're not used to them (tells you '1st exit, second exit,' etc). And whenever I was in a town or village where I wanted to do some sight-seeing or walk around, I turned the Garmin to 'pedestrian' mode and found all kinds of places to eat, shop, drink, and visit. One shouldn't be that excited over technology, but honestly this little add-on made my time in Scotland even more enjoyable. Highly recommend, especially for ignorant Americans like myself who are first-time UK drivers!"
73551,1,"This is by far the best language software program that has ever been made. Now the price is extremely fair. I actually paid $195 for the Level 1 product from a kiosk in the local area. The reason I was willing to pay full price for the product was a couple reasons. First the online subscription has issues and doesn't always seem to run smoothly. Second, I received a great demonstration of the product from the sales associate at a local kiosk. Third, Amazon only gives me 30 days to evaluate the product. If I am not satisfied with the purchase, I have to pay a 20% restocking fee. I want to be able to use the program without having to worry about being online at the same time. And finally if you buy directly from a kiosk, you get 6 months to evaluate the product. There is no restocking fee with a purchase made at a local kiosk."

50432,1,"This version is to me the total Windows killer! It does everything XP can do out the box,half the price,and with less hardware conflicts. I've been using Linspire since version 4.0With other distros I could never get my WIFI working. With Linspire 5,it was working from the first install!Other hardware installs great and it doesn't use up all my RAM and resources like XP. I can be safe from Spam,Malware,Shareware,viruses,and more all with a great looking OS.CNR is a breeze to run,and allows simple installation of software and goodies gallore.If you don't want to se it,try Apt-Get or Synaptic.Either way you get great software better than Windows crippleware. I still think CNR should be free like Xandros Networks and only payable in non-free apps. This makes more sense.The forums are excellent. The Insiders are fairly nice,knowledgable,caring,and respectful. They pretty much can lead you in the right path.Be warned though that those without CNR will usually not get answered by Insiders."

12922,2,"All my Intuit software runs on my old Pentium III 733MHZ machine, so I was VERY DISAPPOINTED after loading TurboTax 2004 Deluxe on the machine and it LOCKED UP trying to start the return. I uninstalled, then re-installed. No Luck! I then tried to install on my Windows XP machine. It works (so far), but I had to import by hand all information that should have been easily imported had it all been on the same machine. I have used Turbo Tax ever since they bought out Parsons Technology which, bar none, had the BEST tax software in the industry - Tax Edge. I had not looked at any of these reviews, because Turbo Tax has ALWAYS done a good job for me - really sorry to hear that they have outsourced their Customer Service to India - that's where my programming job went....but what can you do; there is NO tax software that does the job any better, unless you obtain a copy of software used by professional CPAs."

70229,1,"This is a good educational game for kids. I was somewhat disappointed to discover the relatively slow gameplay and a game engine plagued with bugs and errors. Gameplay is easy enough to understand and despite some technical flaws, will provide endless hours of enjoyment for the children."
75282,1,"We bought this for our son over a year ago. He still plays the games all the time. Some of the games are educational and some are just for fun, he enjoys them all. All of the children who come to play at our house like to play. Some of the games are easier to use than others. Some of the activities are very simple and he loses interest in them very quickly, but over all he enjoys it.

21372,1,"I had previously purchased Digital Image Pro 7 and was quite happy with it. Having said this, I am glad I chose to upgrade to version 10. There have been great improvements, such as making it much easier to select specific areas of a photo for editing - you can even select and delete an object and the program will fill in the background for you. I am still playing around with the various functions, and am sure once I have explored these fully I will be even more pleased. I highly recommend this program."
13681,1,I am surprised how everyone says how wonderful this suite is but never really mentions email protection. Protection is quite good and the main interface is good and easy. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT ZA ONLY SCANS EMAIL/ATTATCHMENTS IF THEY ARE USING OUTLOOK EXPRESS AS A MAIL CLIENT. I emailed ZA and they did confirm that email scanning is not available to other email clients. So all in all a major part of my computer is not protected. This partnership with Microsoft is annoying. I was considering Kaspersky Security Suite but it has the same problem. I guess I will have to look for something else or depend on AOL for mail protection.By the way ZA runs very nicely with AOL. Protection is offered for IM but not email. Kaspersky causes havoc when I run AOL.Oh wellIvan
4324,1,"This is fabulous easy to use security software. And unlike the disastrous installation problems of the 2006 CA Internet Security Suite, this easily installs in just a few minutes, even if you're offline.This also has IM security, and IM blocks, as well as a password setting to keep others from tampering with your blocks and settings...great in offices. :)"
51560,1,"Finished a Java course a few months ago and thought, ok, as far as oop goes, Java is top notch, but boy, oh boy, do the IDE's out there for Java stink! Then I got a hold of VS.NET and started learning C#. Wow! What a killer combo! Even using C# with the free SharpDevelop is better than Java and the incredibly bad Forte. I'll admit JBuilder is pretty good, but no way does it compare to VS.NET. And yes folks, you WILL see .NET applications running on Unix, Linux and Mac very soon, so start learning now!! Gee, you think this might give Sun less to wine about? We'll see. :-)"

48973,1,"Honestly, I am not a guy who favor more microsoft products. But Their products are no doubt damm good. I am very tired to read those negative review and complaint about ""cannot upgrade from win xp pro to vista home..ect"" Why don't people just read the label or run the microsoft upgrade adviser or check the vista home page and read word by word. It detail showed if you want to upgrade from win xp pro to vista home basic need a clean install. The previous version of window xp will be saved on the window.old file in your C drive. You still can retreived importing file there after you re-installed the program. After I upgraded my window xp pro to vista home basic, my machine is faster and the online experience is better. I don't need to worry and waste too much time on the security issue because vista securtiy is tight. Plus you can download the one full year spyware scanner software from CA. It is free for one year. Plus window firewall control traffic both way in and out and window defender. Nice destop design. I am running P4 3.2 2Gig ram, 6800GT with 128MB video with no problem using vista. This is not a high end machine, so don't worry too much about the hardware compatibility. Window vista comes with a lot of preinstalled new drivers for todays hardware. I only download the new sound card driver from creative lab. Vista home basic is worth each penny."
14834,0,"Ok, to start, this is a virtual instrument, and the sound quality is pretty stinking good. All of the drums sound like real drums, none of those fake digital drum sounds.That being said, I feel like I should've gotten more drums for the price. Expansion kits are almost as expensive as the program itself (which is ridiculous), and you only get two main kits to start out with, maybe 40-50 drums total. If they started you with double that, I'd probably give it 4 stars. If their expansions were cheaper, I'd give it four stars.As it stands, 3 stars. It's good at what it does, but it's disappointing how few options you start with."
14776,1,"Microsoft has made its Office applications a bit easier to use and significantly more stable in Office XP. I welcome these enhancements because I'm a heavy user of Word and Excel. Occasional and light users of Office products would probably not find these enhancements worth the upgrade.I'm jazzed about Office's new Task Panes, which are (to me) the primary usability enhancement. I'm a heavy user of find-and-replace. In previous versions of Word, the Replace dialog box was always in the way, covering up text. In Word 2002, this feature appears instead in the task pane, which slides out from the right edge of the window. Instead of covering up the text, it shrinks the text area a little bit. Also, in previous versions of PowerPoint, if you wanted to see how different presentation designs looked on your presentation, you had to open a dialog box, choose a design, apply it, close the dialog box, open the dialog box, choose a design, apply it, close the dialog box, ad nauseam. In PowerPoint 2002, the presentation designs appear in the task pane, avoiding the pesky closing and reopening of a dialog box.I'm encouraged that Office XP seems to crash less than previous versions. When it does crash, it seems to do a better job of recovering your work. Also, it politely tells you when it's going to crash, automatically restarts, and gives you a choice of versions of your document (including checkpoint saves) to open."

88575,0,Everyone else has covered the positive aspects of the game well.The downsides are:- children can randomly guess at many things and thus avoid learning- one of the rescue portions of the software is really just a video game. We found our kids playing this endlessly and removed the software from their machine. If you don't mind video games or have time to always monitor their play it's not a big deal since it is not a huge part of the software
14142,1,"I have used this software with at least four of my grandchildren. They have fun with it. They all read excellently, even the youngest who is in kindergarten and can read chapter books."
61889,0,"I've just started using 6.5 after upgrading from 6.0. The new title designer and the feature to create MPEG2/DVDs work very well. I'm quite pleased with them. The real problem is that Adobe has dropped support for TitleDeko, which I've used quite a bit, and for Real Player and QuickTime. The TitleDeko lack of support means that projects created with 6.0 using TitleDeko won't work with 6.5 unless you re-create the titles...a major hassle for no apparent reason. It would have been nice if the new version supported using title created with the old version. Also, it is no longer possible to create video for the Web using RealPlayer and QuickTime...funny how this didn't make the sales brochure. You're on your own to buy products that support RealPlayer and QuickTime with 6.5, a significant unplanned expense.I'm just not that impressed with Adobe's lack of communicating that features have been dropped and incompatibilities created.The software they've included to make DVDs seems to work well, although I found the interface a bit confusing initially.I had a problem with one video being converted to MPEG2/DVD with a couple of seconds at the end being deleted. I don't know which software caused it, I suspect Premiere, and it doesn't happen all the time."
35866,1,"I'm amazed at the previous reviews of this product. I've been using PlanPlus since February 2006 on six different Windows XP computers: 4 laptops (2 HPs, 1 Dell, and 1 IBM ThinkPad) and 2 desktops (Generic and HP), all running Service Pack 2, without fail.The product implements the FranklinCovey management style into your daily life. I use this product to help me plan my life's goals, my long and short-term goals, my weekly and daily activity, and constantly have in mind my personal mission and values and how I want to live proactively.It has the wonderful Weekly Planner where you review your Mission Statement and Values, your Goals, and then your Roles (how you want to apply your mission and values to the various roles you have in life, e.g., father, husband, co-worker, volunteer, etc.). From there, you assign the Big Rocks you want to accomplish that week.The default view offers the Calendar split into three columns: Tasks (deadlined today or ""Master"" tasks, that is, tasks without a deadline), Appointments and Events, and finally Daily Notes. In addition, there is a 1, 2, 3, or 4-month calendar overview (depends on the width of your computer screen). Above the Daily Notes you'll find the FranklinCovey saying of the day for every day of the year. The overall layout is simple, clear, easy to use, and very appealing.The calendar offers multiple views (Daily, 5-day week, 7-day week, and Month). The 5-day and 7-day week views I find especially useful because it also lists the Tasks assigned for the given days. In addition, all views allow Events (birthdays, anniversaries, etc.). You get a great overview of how you plan your time. You can create tasks, repeating tasks, events, repeating events, appointments, and repeating appointments. Full reminder capabilities are also built-in.Another feature is its contact management, the ability to link contacts to events, and the ability to have a contact and list family members, birthdays, multiple addresses and phone numbers, and much more. Many of my co-workers who have seen this product compare it favorably to other well-known contact management programs.I especially appreciate the Tab feature for the various Notes I've created. Aside from the built-in tabs (Calendar, Contacts, Mission/Values, Goals, and Weekly Planning), you can create your own tabs with your own notes. Notes come in two flavors: typed in (by just about any method - mouse, keyboard, stylus and pad, among others), or by printing your output to the Agilix printer which takes ANY printed output and stores it as a note within a tab. With PlanPlus, you can now electronically print an Internet purchase receipt to a Computer Purchases tab and save an electronic copy of the receipt. I have used the notes to save all my financial information, computer software registration information, printed receipts of online purchases, job information, drivers license information, subscription information, etc.The database can be password protected to prevent accidental exposure of personal information.You can also synchronize data with a Palm computer, another computer running PlanPlus, or Outlook 2003 (Outlook/Exchange, if your company uses it). At work, PlanPlus is syncrhonized with Outlook 2003 and Exchange. I then synchronize my work database with my home copy (via a USB pen/thumb drive) so I don't have to maintain two separate databases and can easily transport the data between the two environments. You can also import and export data to an Outlook 2003 (.PST) or another Agilix database.This product is the envy of my co-workers because of the amount of detail I can bring to my professional life. My personal life is much better directed through this tool. I am finally putting my mission and values into practice in all facets of my life."

64155,1,Good product and fairly easy to use. The software allows you create straightforward topo maps at whatever scale you desire. I am an archaeologist and most mapping software is extremely expensive. TOPO! is reasonable priced and produces quality results.The only reason I did not give 5-stars is because the waypoint labeling information is cumbersome and difficult to edit.
65763,1,"Research this purchase! Know what you are getting. There is hardly enough room in a review like this to give you the info you really need. This program is a serious, hard-core 3D modeling/animation/rendering package. There is an enormous community of users that (for some reason) seems to stick together. To learn about this product, start at http://www.newtek.com . Check out www.newtekpro.com and www.keyframemag.com . These are two magazines dedicated to the software. There are also many other options out there, apart from LighWave. Depending on your needs, you may want to research Maya, Softimage|XSI, Cinema 4D, 3ds max, World Construction Set, Bryce, Poser, Truespace, Electric Image, Strata, or Vue d'espirit. Each of these software packages has its advantages and disadvantages. Most people would probably tell you that the biggest advantages of LightWave are the polygonal modeling tools, and the rendering engine. I use LightWave all the time, and the areas which I find lacking are the complete absence of procedural modeling tools like those of 3ds max -of course, 3ds max lacks great polygonal modeling-, and its lack of more sophisticated particle and texturing features, such as in Maya paint effects. But LightWave is really built on the concept of providing a powerful core piece of software, to which you can add what functionality you wish, via plugins and other 3rd party extensions. All that said, LighWave really is a reletively straightforeward, easy-to-use program, and you can get things done a lot more quickly in LightWave than in most other packages. By the way, &quot;duo-dongle&quot; in the product title refers to the USB hardware key that comes with LighWave, which works for Macs and PCs."
7385,1,"When I got a new computer at the end of 2001, the 2002 edition was installed on my computer by Gateway. Although I never used Streets and Trips (and barely used Encarta), I used Word and Picture It! quite heavily.Well, my hard drive died a few weeks ago, and I had to get a new computer. I bought Microsoft Works Suite 2006 to go with it.I was a bit apprehensive because Picture It! was replaced with Microsoft Digital Image Standard 2006 Editor. It took me a while to get fluent in Picture It!, and the idea of learning a new photo system was daunting. (I write mostly for the web, and use pictures to accompany my reviews and articles--as well as for eBooks.)I haven't done any extensive work with it yet, but it appears easy to use IF you have experience with Picture It! If you've never used any image program before, it may be a bit confusing. (I feel that Picture It! was more self-explanatory.)However, for all that the Works Suite gives you, I feel it's a good buy. Word 2002 has advantages over the older version (for example, you can easily insert images), and Encarta may be helpful for kids doing homework (or curious adults wanting to learn more about something).Updating Encarta is easy as clicking a mouse: just open up the program and click ""Update Encarta"". New articles and updates will automatically be added to your computer.Although I *still* don't use Streets and Trips (I go to MapQuest reflexively), I still think this is a great Suite for a great price."
1308,1,"I buy ENCARTA every year, and BRITANNICA from time to time. This is my opinion:TEXT: Britannica's writing style is more sophisticated, and its authors are very well known. However, Encarta is not bad written at all, its authors are good and the contents are more or less the same, or better in the last versions.You can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year, but only quarterly (4 times). Encarta is updated EVERY WEEK with new articles and additions to the old ones.MULTIMEDIA and FEATURES: Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries, Atlas, 2 D and 3 D virtual tours, timeline, games ... It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text, multimedia and features are completely integrated.NAVIGATING: Encarta wins again. You only have to type a phrase, a word or de beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contains it. If you have typed the name of a small village lost in Senegal (e.g.), you see it in the Atlas without clicking again. If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you meet with what was looking for. To go ""jumping"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the ""Related Articles"" section. If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft's WORD is perfect.Navigating with Britannica is different. You do not get crazy, but ... I only say that, if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings.My computer is Pentium III 1000 Mhz 256 RAM, and I have copied Britannica into the hard drive (the same with Encarta). The fact is that it is very slow, and that takes a lot of RAM (50 % more or less). If you have other programs open, perhaps Britannica does not work. With Encarta, you do not have any problem.I hope my opinion is helpful for you."

11060,1,"I've used a lot of PSP conversion software (movies to PSP), but none of them was a simple and complete as this package. What's best is that the software not only converts your movies, but also stores and organizes them for you so when you delete a movie off your PSP, you don't have to worry about converting it again if you want to watch it again.All products lack a ripper because of Hollywoods ridiculous limitations on their movies, but I personally find that Anydvd does a great job - you install anydvd, run video vault, then presto! all you dvds can be transferred to your PSP."
41074,1,"This is certainly a great program for every budding artist or computer graphics major. It sure has come a long way from the first version! There are so many options, it is so much more animated, etc.The only bad thing I saw mentioned in other reviews too. There are no labels on the buttons with actual words, so it's kind of hard to remember what is where. They should have put words with the graphics already on the buttons representing what they are.But, I suppose, if you use the program enough, the problem is no longer an issue because you get so used to where everything is. Cool game!"

This is not a comfortable headset. It is very tight and bulky. I am not a big person and found it uncomfortable. I have sent back for a refund. When they get a lighter weight headset I will probably buy the more inexpensive version of Dragon Speaks. When using it in Excel it was faster to click in the cells with my mouse vs. saying ""Tab""."
65552,1,I got this software and the Plextor converter to work together and they do. Opted for this instead of installing the software that came with the converter simply because I first heard about the software and then found the box. En joying learning how to do different things and have plans to put together a DVD set of home movies for my family this Christmas.I've had very good luck so far. Everything I've converted has come out better than expected. The only problem I have is the software freezes sometimes when I'm trimming. I think it's a time out problem. I've worked it out by saving after each trim so I don't lose my work. Hope to have more time soon and be able to figure this out. Other than that it is working very well for a novice like me.
93519,1,"I'm not sure why there seem to be bad reviews of this product. I read about slowdowns (which happen on the first boot because it has to configure itself), but it has been just as fast or faster than previous releases (have tried 2004 and 2005 personally). This product is great! The 2005 version found a virus on my system last year, and the firewall made my system so that it is all but invisible, and stopped multiple hacking attempts (popup lets you know that someone, gives IP, is trying to hack your system)..I give 2006 NIS a thumbs up, and will continue to buy their products!"
76880,1,"I haven't written a review before, but since my 5 year old loves this, I felt compelled. The game is hard to figure out at first and requires an adult's help initially, but she caught on quickly. As for needing to keep at it, you can save the game part way through, so it's really not an issue. This is one of the more intelligent games we've found. If your little one likes Freddy Fish, she/he will probably really like this one."
2242,1,"Upon installation, it did not work - only 1 OS would boot. Downloaded latest build, but still didn't work. Contacted support team. They created a new build & emailed it. At least they did so quickly. Been working OK since.It works ok as a boot manager, but since it doesn't do everything I need it to as a parition manager, I still need Partition Magic. Kind of expensive for just a boot manager."
77379,1,"I bought this because I have severe hand problems, and typing was becoming more and more painful for me. About eight years ago, I tried using one of the first versions of Dragon NaturallySpeaking. It was a complete disaster! It seemed like I had to manually fix every other word. So, I was skeptical that this newer version would be as good as it claimed.I'm happy to report that I was wrong. While not perfect, this version is much more accurate. I expect that, as the program adapts to my voice and vocabulary, the accuracy will improve. But so far, I've been very impressed with the current level of accuracy. The only reason I have rated this product with four stars instead of five is because of the enormous amount of memory it uses. Dragon NaturallySpeaking appears to use about as much memory as World of Warcraft.Overall, though, I'm very impressed with this product. It works in any window that has a space for text input, including chat windows. Needless to say, I am dictating this review."
54480,1,"This software is great!! I have tried other software for making DVDs. They seem to require a Pentium 6 4000 MHz to run (note the exaggeration). But that is the way it seems or you won't get a good burn on your DVD. I only have a AMD Atlon 1GHz with 384 MB memory and it works great.This software is very easy to use and just plain fun. you can add a ""scene selection"" menu with the click of the mouse. Literally.You can also add audio tracks to the main selection menu. The preview boxes on the menu can also show tiny clips of the video. And even control how much of the video the tiny clip plays, where it starts, whether it loops or not, etc.Love it."

47286,0,"After completing the initial Trade Winds game I was really excited to get started on the sequel, Trade Winds II - thinking that, even if it was the same exact game with just a few different locals it would be great (as I absolutely LOVED Trade Winds I). However I was sorely disappointed, as the changes they chose to make made the game pale in comparison to the original.Here are the main differences:1. Instead of being able to build your fleet, purchasing up to 10 vessels in TW1, here you're stuck with only 1 boat - yet you still have to fight pirates who have fleets of boats at their disposal.2. Because you don't have a fleet, you now have extremely limited storage space - so you can't purchase & sell near as much3. To add insult to injury, you also are banned from purchasing storage space in any other port besides your home port - so once again, your hands are tied as to the amount of goods you are able to purchase & sell4. The music doesn't always match the port - and much of it is really annoying.5. The characters are new, but their aren't near as many to choose fromI have to say that I'm wondering if they may have felt rushed to get the sequel out before people forgot about how good the initial game was. But, in my opinion, in their haste to create something similar, yet different, they made some really bad decisions.Now, I do realize that if this was the first Trade Winds game I had ever played I might have rated it higher. But when compared to TW1, this game just doesn't hold a candle to it!"

17561,1,"I bought the Spyder 2 suite and the monitor calibration worked very well. The printer calibration, not so good. The printer calibration is strictly a judgement call. You pring a picture from the program and they match it to the monitor picture. I could have done that without paying extra for a program that is pretty lame. I thougtht the printer program would print something and then the hardware would scan it and set the printer program, unfortunatley it doesn't work that way. As I said at the stare the monitor calibration worked very well and was easy to use.Earl Stuckey"
14727,1,"This is the biggest change in Office since 1997. With the new &quot;smart tags&quot; cuts your work in half! A ""smart tag"" recognizes what you are doing by reading the text. Increased security in Access provides a safer more relaxed work place; it helps by using 128-bit security! First comes Word. My most favorable upgrade is being able to combine multiple documents and put them all into one! Collaborative! The voice response feature isn't that great, it needs to be worked on a bit for feature office products. But it still works and saves major time. Next comes Outlook, I think the best new feature is color-coated colander dates, when you set a date it is now in color, rather than having them all in black and white and squinting my eyes to see what the freaking day's appointments are. Then comes PowerPoint, one of my personal favorite office programs. The best thing refined is the smoother, animations that give you a better feel while doing your presentation. Now comes Excel. This also contains the &quot;smart tags&quot;. But thing I found was that you could now look up stock prices on the Internet...woooo.The system requirements as usual for any office products are large. I am running on a P3 650, 128 sdram, and a 8.4 gig drive. 245 MB of available hard disk space and zn additional 115 MB is required on the hard disk where the operating system is installed. So as you can see it takes a lot of power to operate these innovative tools, its a well worth investment. It'll be interesting to see how Windows XP and Office XP work together!"

There are a few different procedures to follow to do a good backup, and while it has a wizard, the wizard does not warn you of certain things. For example, you want to use ""Duplicate"" rather than ""Backup"" because you will get complete files in your backup. It does come with a very comprehensive manual, and I will admit to not reading the whole darn thing. Once you get it going, it will do everything you need it to, and quickly. It's been good for my small business and home use. I recommend it because I have not found anything better. But study it, and call tech support if needed. They were pretty good."

Only improvement is that when going into a roundabout (lots and lots of them in England), it said exit 2 and street name but the signs were the street numbers - A24, etc. Not a big problem if you just listen to and follow second exit though. It also gave an idea of how long the jouney would take so that was helpful too."

1081,0,"I had Office Pro 2000 on an earlier system, which died via a hardware failure. When I bought a new computer, I did not install Office 2000, but later installed the Office Pro 2007 Demo. When that was expiring, I ordered the upgrade CD.Somewhere I read that - to upgrade - Office 2000 (for me) needed to exist on my new system, so I installed it. This messed up the 2007 demo, and also removed all my existing contacts and messages. So when the upgrade CD finally arrived (that's another story), I tried the ""conversion"" from the demo to the real version. It didn't work.So I removed the demo and installed anew. That worked okay, except that after some 3 attempts none of the CD #2 files would install. I gave up at that point."

I'd heard there were installation issues and the cost was another factor but I decided the investment was a bigger gain than risk. I did the necessary back ups and I encourage you to do so prior to installation. The new version went in without a hitch and I'm very happy with my upgrade. Do yourself a favor and give your Mac the gift of Christmas if you haven't already done so. You'll be happy with the end result."
8459,1,"I purchased the software because it's getting very difficult to use the keyboard and mouse due to a neuromuscular disease. I have the software for two days now and it is doing well for replacing the keyboard. I have what Doctors call a &quot;thick speech&quot; and people have a hard time understand what I'm saying. The teaching tool is working well, and already the program understands me almost as well as people.The one thing I was hoping would be a little better, is the commands. Navigating around windows without using a mouse is difficult and it doesn't work well with Microsoft Outlook unless you have a professional version. It's good with Internet Explorer but surfing the Web with other browsers is rather difficult if you're trying to avoid using a mouse. It would be nice if you could download program specific commands from a web site or create your own macros.My final thoughts,This is proving to be a valuable tool for replacing the keyboard, but I am finding myself searching for a different method to replace the mouse."

63158,0,"I have had this program for a couple of months now and I have really enjoyed it, but in fact it was released before it was fully tested and has bugs in it that it shouldn't. At times it will inexplicably lose parameters off of parameter dials; it will show the parameter dial for a particular object with parameters for another object. Just now it was showing me the parameter dials for &quot;main camera&quot; with options such as &quot;twist&quot; which were obviously for another object, I think a neck). As I was trying to move a prop, it suddenly gave me an error message saying an object with that name already exists so the name has been changed; a review of the prop list shows it has added a copy of the prop and given it the name of another (third) prop with &quot;-1&quot; appended, which I didn't tell it to do, and which didn't have anything to do with what I was doing at the time (except that it copied the prop I was trying to move). It's really incomprehensible. This has happened several times and once a file is messed up this way it's ruined, although earlier saved copies are still ok.As I say, I'm enjoying the program a lot when it works, but I can't honestly recommend it anymore. I kind of resent Curious Labs for releasing it in this condition--given the enormous amount of time one must often invest developing a 3D scene. I've downloaded the two patches on their website and they didn't help anything.I'm running it in Windows XP with 640 Megabytes of RAM and a 1300 megaherts AMD Athlon processor."
24837,1,"I discovered RootsMagic (v3.0) fairly recently. First, some background... I'm working with roughly 2000 names, and my goal is to research and publish the data, along with personal stories. I started with Family Tree Maker several years ago, but I didn't like the lack of citation capabilities with that earlier version. So, I switched to The Master Genealogist (TMG) which provides great source management but has a clumsy interface. The newer release of TMG has not improved this. Because you spend a lot of time entering information, the interface needs to be fairly painless and transparent. So, then I looked at Legacy, GenBox and RootsMagic, which have the necessary functionality but are also easy to use. It was a difficult choice between Legacy and RootsMagic, but I chose RootsMagic because I felt that it had a slight edge in its source management and that this feature was comparable to The Master Genealogist.Installation was easy. After I exported my old TMG database files to a single .gedcom file, I used RootsMagic to import it. It was fast and the data loaded quite cleanly. RootsMagic lets you import GEDCOM files, Family Origins database and backup files, and PAF database files. Also, for anyone working with LDS, you can create and read TempleReady files and handle ordinances.The interface is easy to use and it provides three views: Pedigree, Family and Descendants. You can access an individual or family by selecting the name from a list and loading it into the views. To modify an individual's data or relationships, you can right-click on the name (in any view or list) to access options from the popup menu. RootsMagic provides master lists for Sources, To-Do, Addresses, Repository, Correspondence, Places, and Fact types. Also, you can modify places, which contain addresses/locations, to include Latitude and Longitude coordinates, describe the history of the place, and include multimedia files (e.g., maps and photos).Of course, this tool's major advantage is its source management capabilities. You can assign one or more sources to an individual, a family, or an event. Whenever you create a new source, you can define the information through a Source dialog box that has multiple tabs (Source, Text, Multimedia, and Respository), and link multiple media assets to the source (e.g., photos, files, sound, and video). Also, each time you assign the source to something, you can enter descriptive text for just that specific assignment.As you enter data into RootsMagic, the application writes to an .rmg file for which you can create multiple backups. You can also export to the GEDCOM format for easy importing into other genealogy applications. When you export, you can define what will be exported and manage privacy options. You can generate books and reports (in many different formats). You can also publish to a web format (although I don't like the way RootsMagic outputs this). Also, I found some search capabilities to be better when they're done through the Reporting functions. Other RootsMagic options include calculators (relationship, Soundex and Date), shareable CD creation, timelines, color-coding of individuals, and charts (including wall-sized ones).In conclusion, do not let the lower price or the easy-to-use interface dissuade you. This application has some serious citation/source capabilities that makes it competitive with The Master Genealogist and ahead of some other similar applications."

18247,1,"CK Scrapbook Designer has nearly everything you need to create your scrapbook pages. (There are also some great new add-on CD's containing digital art images from another company, FanCraftic, everything from buttons to tags and more.)The photo editing tools and special effects are a real plus. But I especially like the shadow effects, it makes my digital layouts have dimension. I have tried other products and no one has a shadow feature that's this easy to use or as effective. In fact, people seem to think I used expensive software well known in the design world to make my pages, but I use CK Scrapbook, instead!I can also email my pages to family and friends! And it makes it easy to make extra copies for them as well...a time and money saver!Plus, I can still scrapbook traditionally by printing out my own unique background papers or my journaling (on vellum, even!)This package also includes greeting cards, calendars and more, plus special CK Fonts. It's a great all around value, and very easy to use. Now you have no excuse---get those keepsakes created!"

27146,0,"This is a pretty good game over all, though the mystery is impossible! I finished it but only w/ the help of another commenter who gave me the combination. the graphics stink on this game and u get a lot of refusals to jumps when u didn't do anything wrong, there are glitches, like the petting is supposed 2 raise your horse's morale but never does, and 1/2 the time it's impossible 2 clean their hooves! But the competitions are really fun! but a couple are really hard! the ending 2 this game is awful! nothing is explained, and u don't know what happens to the farm or anything! the riding is fun, but unrealistic there are 6 gaits instead of 4 like in real life, and Mathieau's hints in the beginning don't really help and make it confusing, hardly anything is explained. Garance is a huge SNOB! The horses are cool but I wish u could pick the gender and breed. I don't think it's worth your money if your interested in figuring out the mystery because you won't. but if you don't care about the mystery and just want to ride, and ride in competitions this is a good game for that! BTW the combination for the wheel is, 7 of clubs, 4 of hearts, 9 of diamonds, 10 of hearts, 10 of spades, 2 of clubs, 7 of diamonds. be prepared to be disappointed at the end!"
78979,1,"My son got this for his birthday or Christmas from my mom. He was about 6 when he got it, and loved it -- and we played through two or three levels without realizing that we had the brightness control on the monitor turned down so far we couldn't see everything! Once we fixed that, it was still a wonderful challenge, and he would sit both with me and on his own for quite some time, solving the riddles and finding the objects. My mom ONLY buys educational games or toys -- and when she came to visit, she got to play. I thought I would have to get it for her for HER next gift. It is fun for many ages that like puzzles and word games, and to think a little bit out of the box without becoming entirely too frustrated. I especially like that more than one person can play the game with their own 'name' and pick up where they left off. That way, I could make a 'mommy' entry, and play ahead of my son when many evenings after he went to bed. Once I got to a certain distance ahead of where he was (I'm almost ashamed to admit how much time I spent playing it) I would go back to help him with a last thing, and I would have forgotten where the item was or what it was looking for, and we'd have to work together to solve it all over again! I have a nearly photographic memory for some things, but this completely overwhelmed it. I enjoy challenges like that -- andbI'm nearly 40. I have also picked up another I SPY game -- Spooky Mansion for when he gets finished with this one. I give it another few months and he'll be there. I have a lot of confidence that it will be just as much fun as this one."
86458,1,"I shoot Nikon cameras (D80 and D70) in raw mode as well as non-Nikon point and shoot cameras. I also have and use Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Adobe LightRoom. The latest release of Nikon Capture NX has caused me to change my work flow because of the ease of use. The U-Point Technology really makes a difference (once you figure out how to use it) and in most cases it eliminates the need to use Photoshop layers, etc. This program has saved me many hours in doing photo edits. From a work flow standpoint, I use Nikon View first to review raw files and then I move to Nikon Capture NX for edits, adjustments and sharpening. Only in some cases do I need to use PhotoShop now."
54475,1,"If you are looking at Premier Pro, you've probably already had multiple frustrating failures with other Products like Pinnacle and Ulead. You won't have those failures with Adobe. It has a lot of complex tools but once you get the basics, it's a breeze. I would recommend buying the ""Classroom in a Book"" if you need some tutorials. You don't get any technical support unless you pay extra (I did and I've made them earn it). I bought the suite and felt it was well worth it, but if you just want to edit your video and burn a disk, you might not need that much firepower (or want to spend that kind of money).After Effects is an amazingly complex bit of software but does some fantastic stuff. I definitely needed the tutorials for it.Encore allows you to set up menus - beware! This part is video-card-memory-intensive (so is After Effects for that matter). Make sure your system can handle it."
88272,1,"Tried Pinnacle's Dazzle product and had huge problems on Vista installation, spend a full day to make it work and system kept crashing. Somebody recommended this product.

Needed to convert some old PAL Hi8 tapes, and customer service provided very precise instructions for how to do it. Customer service responses were a little slow, but as great as everything was, I easily forgive that."
68460,1,"I have been using PSP 9 for long and had to decide between an upgrade to PSE 5 or PSP XI. I downloaded PSP XI trial and found that most of the stuff were bells and whistle and could be achieved easily by PSP 9 (or not needed, for that matter). So, I decided to give PSE 5 a try. Since, I don't have any prior experience with the older versions, cannot compare with them. However, the first impression is that it is slower than PSP 9. I missed a hard copy manual as well. I always like to read a book rather than browse manual on a CD. However most of the tools are self-explanatory with a few difference in operations from PSP. I really like the Magic Selection Brush Tool. With the right kind of images and strokes, it works wonders. Makes selection very easy. I don't miss undo/ redo because, I always have the Undo History palette in the palette bin. Having used PSP 9, I somehow like the arrangement of tools/ palettes in PSP9 and find it more full featured in image editing front. Maybe because I am still learning PSE? I would have liked an option of allowing me to select the tools I put on the toolbar. And I like the option of scripting on PSP 9. PSE gives an option of correcting lens blur and motion blur under sharpening that is useful. Curves has to be adjusted by sliders (sic). Hey, tedious but works! But PSE gives more options for creating ""stuffs"" from your photos. But what bowled me over for PSE is the excellent organizer. [...]"

66600,1,"Okay, the professional review says that this product is easy to install and setup straight out of the box and that no computer experience is neccessary. Well, you might get lucky. Linux is a fantastic operating system and is a viable alternative to Windows but... While the installation tool YAST2 set up the system using an intuitive installation interface it didn't quite get everything right; getting my graphics card to work properly meant going to the vendors site (NVIDIA) and downloading their drivers and installing them myself. Additionally tweaking the system is not as easy as with Windows and, of course, you have a limited selection of software that will run on Linux. Having said all that, with SUSE Linux you get an excellent set of installation and application manuals (when was the last time Microsoft put documentation in their box?) and there is quite a bit of software that comes with the system. You get two complete office packages (K office and OpenOffice) which are more or less compatible with MS Office. While not too many software companys write versions for Linux, not too many virus authors do either. Now that most of the bugs are out of Linux it is a phenomonally stable system. I haven't ever had to reboot my Linux box in the past couple of years, where my XP machine gets the &quot;master bus reset&quot; treatment every couple of months. Also SUSE does provide 90 days of installation support, which I haven't had to use as I have fairly extensive UNIX/Linux experience. Overall, if you want to dabble in Linux and either have some computer savvy or are willing to learn this package is more than worth the price!"

89895,1,"Having used many utility programs (System Works, System Suite, etc..), I can honestly compare them with System Mechanic.Pros:1. It is very effective IF used properly. For beginners use ""Maintanence Wizard"" this will effectively and safely optimize and clean your OS.2. ""Netbooster"" actually DOES make your internet connection faster! I mean Wopping fast, if you have DSL or a cable modem. Even if you have 56K modem, you will consistently see an improvement.3. Gives you much control over your computer, you can customize your Windows according to your preference quickly.Cons:1. If you use System Mechanic manually (i.e., without using ""Maintenance Wizard"") to fix things, be very careful. You must know what you are doing, or else you might destablize your computer. I recommend ""Maintenance Wizard"" for safe and effective optimization.2. No defragment program.Sum:Very powerful tool. It really optimized my computer (Win 2000, XP). More than SystemWorks or System Suite."
8750,1,"My son just received this for his 5th birthday. At first when he opened this up, I thought...""Oh no, not another disapointing computer game."" I was afraid it was going to be either too difficult for him to understand, confusing, or just too stupid for it to be worth his time. Well, was I wrong. He has played this game almost every day for two weeks and it continues to challenge and excite him.The game challenges my son to complete several tasks as the engineer of Thomas. My son is learning to listen carefully to the directions and makes sure to follow them exactly to complete the tasks. Some of the directions are a little confusing, but with a little help from Mom or Dad we can get him back on track. The best part of the game is the boost in confidence and independence in him that we can see. I would highly recommend this game for any Thomas fan of age 4 or older."

42977,1,"I bought this item from Amazon.com because it was the cheapest way to upgrade my new Vista-based laptop, which included a trial version of Office Home and Student edition. Well, the product key that came in the Microsoft packaging was invalid. I tried numerous different attempts, as the Microsoft help web sites advised, to key in the product key. I even tried to uninstall the pre-installed trial version of Office, then install from the included CD to no avail. Finally, a call to the noticeably off-shore-based Microsoft help center eventually led me to get another product key over the phone. After that beginning all went better.So far, luckily, the old function key sequences for short cuts still work. Otherwise, I would be lost in the new menu interfaces in each of these products. I don't like the fact that the basic toolbars such as font attributes which used to be always visible are now only visible when the correct tab has been selected."

45920,1,"TECHNICAL ASPECTS FOR INSTALLATIONThis game uses windows 2000/XP with Direct X version 9.0C which is included on the CD;on your pc select start->run->dxdiag to see if you are running Direct X and which version; the CD will automatically detect and upgrade/install Direct X. Incredible graphics which look very similar to the movie scenes with respect to the clarity and vivid colors. As of Jan 2006, this is using technology well, as opposed to the Win95 era games which look very antiquainted by comparison.The hardware running this game at my house is the same I use for creating/editing home movie DVDs (fast processor, 2005 fast harddrive) and there is no problem with speed. However, if you have say, a pre-2002 computer for example there might be some issues with speed, hardware compatibility, etc.GAMESFor the child of 3-4 years old who is just learning colors, numbers, letters and pattern recognition (diamonds, rectangles, stars, stripes) this game is appropriate.There are about 3 or 4 games and they are developed well in the sense that they teach a specific skill in each game. If there were more games, it would be great. My child spends about 1 hour broken into 20 minute sessions a day playing the game and enjoys it very much. It is his preferred activity in the morning.If the child can use the mouse, he can play the game;It will take a few times of parent involvement to get started because to start the game there are some specific steps which have to be followed but after 5 or so times the child should be able to start by himself.The music and graphics are very pleasant. However, one aspect which was noted immediately was that after something is clicked, the fish talk or do something and the reaction from the game is not immediate and the child who does not wait for the fish to finish talking will click again because he doesn't see the expected result immediately. For example, Dory has a big mouth and talks for about 10 seconds after the mouse click quite frequently. Until Dory finishes her sentence, the game does not take you to the next scene.This was well worth the money spent in my opinion as it teaches well."

Today, when I tried to open it and check on the pages I'd done, it would not open.I got an answer of 'Run-time error '0'.'I tried to reload it but it would not work. Now I found out on the New Novelist 3.0 page that they quit doing anything for 2.0 in 20011. Now I do not know if I can ever see those pages I had written and know I'll never reproduce them the same.SO I wouldn't get 2.0 now! I've tried to get the 3.0 but I can't get it to download. Sheesh.I am having a very bad day!Michelle Brown"

It even showed loging roads in the Algonquin that hadn't been used in years and were completely overgrown - and it would navigate you there.

13678,1,"After reading other reviews of this program, I took their advice and performed a google search of ""ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite"" + problems. And what did I find? The top entries are Amazon reviews (generally favorable), and reviews by [...] and computershopper.com where professional editors gave very favorable reviews. Not what I was lead to believe by some reviewers. Makes you wonder what motive some people have? I say listen to the professional reviews."

88830,0,"Much like anyone on here I've seen the mini-series/Final battle when i was young...loved them both and still to this day couldn't get them out of my head so I purchased both movies. But even still as a kid i couldn't get into the TV series of, ""V"" if you asked me i don't really know it was something about the show that really turned me off but yet i was still compelled to watch it weekly like a kid looking for a Christmas gift and in a way to this day still feels that way.V The complete series (Technically isn't really complete)is 19 episodes of the main weekly TV series that was on from late 1984 to early 1985 that chronicles the continuing battle of the resistance from the ""Visitors"" who are alien beings from another planet that looks identically like humans with two simple differences, one, they are lizards underneath and two, they love our earth for supplies...US!Given to the circumstances that this takes place a year after the highly popular, ""V"" The final battle you would think that the story, characters, as well as action will be just as much epic as the mini-series counter parts..in some ways it was and in others it fell apart on many levels on what could of been a very engaging hour of good vs. evil in somewhat dictator-like world the visitors created.Starting with the first episode, ""Liberation Day"" the show introduce you back to the favorite heroes and villains but you will already know a couple of strange changes that unfortunately was never explained in the show and still is never explain on the dvd...the voice resonance is gone from the visitors which i found that strange but I let it slide and either way the first episode was pretty good and it explains what happens to them in the aftermath of the red dust but then it slips and does something totally different they introduce you to a cardboard like villain to the name of Nathan bates (Lane Smith) he starts off very stiff in nature and I wasn't really impressed that there was never a back story to his character I'm sure they could of made on or two episodes explaining who he is and how far he knew about the events from the first two mini-series...never really hinted...then you are introduced to a very Sexy older version of the ""star child"" Elizabeth (Jennifer Cooke= sexy)i guess they didn't want to keep her as a child anymore and make her into a sex pistol but either way I'm sure at the time it gather a bit of ratings for that move, but after the first episode things suddenly went downhill and just down right funny.Don't get me wrong I have no problems with most of the episodes one of which called, ""The hero"" which the fight scenes between Mike Donovan and the Visitor Charles (who we will get to later) were one of the most coolest fights I've seen on that series but that's as far as I can go with this series; I'm sorry but i have to hit the bad notes to it. The first thing you will realize is that...there are lack of gun fights....I'm sorry what I mean is that there are lack of gun fights with the lazer rifles meaning I'm guessing because they were on budget or maybe they just didn't want to shoot and let them run (which in some scenes i thought that was funny) but you very rarely got that much intense gun/lazer fights like you have with the predecessors...it was mostly resistance shoots guns, visitors get blown up (either that or they duck for cover and shoot ONCE or maybe twice), resistance escape...end of story and sometimes not even in those categories but either way...with that lack of tense action it fails to leave a mark on certain episodes but yet you still feel compelled to watch more.Another issue is one of few complaints that most have the same issues about...Character deaths. Now I for one like to think realistically, of course in war people die, but when you have your characters die in some of the Worst and un-realistic ways possible it just leaves a lot of questions in the air. I think there were two characters that would of have potential to be more strong in the series as it progressed died in unexpected ways i just had to say, ""WTF!!?"" (trust me watch the series all the way thru and you'll see what I mean) but i felt that if they could of died it would be a lot more bolder and braver than just the way they made it to be and it was just plain sad...not sad as in, ""i'm going to cry"" sad but pitiful sad.Another downside to this and again its one of the many complaints most people noticed in this series....constant re-hashing of certain scenes and expect A LOT of them...i could help but to laugh when it happens cause i felt like wow, they must of really lost money somewhere to find different sets...different rooms, different everything which lead me to think, how DID they lose all that money from the first two mini-series!? I honestly felt that both V the mini series and the final battle even though at the time special effects were sublime they were still good and due to the fact it was generating fans it should have been making a lot of money (Via revenue from the station at the time that or warner bros.) so when they made this series they should have IMPROVED on each episode but instead it digressed into something that was left to be desired, and the results become very repetitive scenes, very bad action scenes, same sets from time to time, and of course not so good acting. But actually the visitor Charles (Duncan Regehr) was one of the most interesting and somewhat cool characters in the series. His flamboyance and charm makes the show pretty good it seem to put a lot of spark into the episodes when he's on them besides Elizabeth.But with each episode it started to become downright ridiculous or almost desperate to keep ratings up I almost felt really bad for how the show went downhill but when the cliffhanger came on..i had to burst out laughing when it ended, ""to be continued...."" with that dramatic music the only thing i had in my mind was, ""hahahahahaha....its never going to continue...hahahahah"". There three DVDs and they are all double sided...so you have side A and side B; Now, i don't know if that was a cheap move or a smart one but either way they could of added four episode to each disc it was that simple to do but they didn't want to maybe much like some of the episodes it wasn't in their budget. Also, warner bros, could of taken the time to ask some of the actors to come in and put a commentary to most of these episodes...i'm sure they have time on their hands to at least discuss the best and worst of the show...again if you are expecting commentary and deleted scenes you're not going to get it in this one...and you will NOT get the digital 5.1 experience nor its not digitally remastered so at least if you feel nostalgic and would like to see most of the episodes EXACTLY how they looked when it was on tv back in 1984 then you would like this...which in someways it was a cool touch but they could of remastered.The best thing about this dvd is the fact that even with all of the shortcomings and the rather funny cliffhanger type ending; it still hold the feel of watching the show for the first time, and its easy to lose yourself into the V universe but due to lack of commentary and any other features its pretty much, ""you get what you buy"" scenarios i have to keep this at a 3 star for the fact that it could of been a really good show if they played it smart and rely on what made the mini series a success and that would have been to bring Kenneth Johnson into the mainstream at least have him write one or two (maybe all) episode and put more depth into the characters and the situations they are in...which they didn't really do but if you are a fan this would be something to pick up and hold on too...cause even though I'm a tough critic...i still brought this to add it to my ""V"" collection...so now I'm reading V: The second Generation.3 out of 5 stars"
3923,1,With version 8 you get KDE 3.03 and Gnome 2.0 - both serious challengers to XP in terms of user interface. Installation is now a breeze with its updated installation manager..If you want a solid and well-maintained Linux distro it would be difficult top Red Hat.
23662,1,"This software is used to record analog sources to CD. I have used it to convert nearly 50 vinyl albums and about 20 cassette tapes to CDs. Some had some significant sonic problems which I have been able to fix with this software. Except for the worst files, this software has a way to fix it.I have an earlier version of DART Pro. I believe an updated version is still available on on the Web at a reasonable price. When I bought my version, it had a $400 retail price, but I found it OEM for $10. The newer version has an improved interface, and is a lot less than $400.It does a very credible job of repairing all but the worst audio source files. On average, the vinyl records I have recorded to CD had around 50,000 to 60,000 usually small scratches in them. This program has filters to de-hiss, de-hum, de-noise, and remove most scratches from your collection. If you want, you can copy and paste one section of the sound track over another. This is useful in instances where the software does not properly remove a scratch. If you really need to, you can copy a small section of sound from near the scratch which looks like the damaged section, paste it over the damage, and you have an almost inaudible patch.You can equalize, extend, shorten, and do most of what you need to fix poor quality audio. I had one tape which was a copy of a copy of a copy .... of a speach which was recorded in 1957. It was virtually impossible to understand the speaker. I was able to equalize the sound, and run it through a de-hiss routine and ended up with a file which was much better. In addition, the tape was just over 80 minutes long, but the software enabled me to compress it to under 80 minutes so I could put it on one CD.In addition, after recording to your hard drive, the program allows you to automatically ""unpack"" long recordings and find the song breaks. It works fairly well with standard albums with good breaks between the songs. If not, you can cut a section of audio from the main audio file, open a new file, and paste in the portion you want. It is a bit time consuming, but it gets the job done right.One of the best features is that it does not write over the source file, and instead builds an audio tree. You can make changes to an audio file, see how it sounds, and if you don't like it, you can go back to the original, modify the settings and re-do it.It also has its own CD burning software which will work with both WAV audio files and MP3s. It actually does an on-the-fly conversion of MP3s, so it is faster than Windows Media Player at converting MP3s back to CD. The CD burner lets you control the time in between songs, so if you copy an album, you can just set the time break to 0 seconds, instead of the standard 2, so it sounds just like the original.The software has too many features to describe them all in this short review. Once you have learned the major features, it is very functional software"
77661,1,"I bought this earlier issue of Creator because it has feature called ""Drag to Disc"". It allows you to copy and paste or drag and drop a file, graphic, video or audio file directly onto a CD or DVD without doing any fancy gyrations. It also allows you to have the disk remain open so you can add more files or to close it so it can be used on other computers. (NOTE: If you leave it open you can only ""play"" the files on your or another computer that has ""Packet Writing"". Don't ask me what that is but that's what Roxio calls it. The Drag to Disc on 7.5 allows you to scan a disk to possibly fix it if it becomes unreadable. I have Roxio 9 and that feature is missing. Also 7.5's Drag to Disk's menu allows you to pick which CD/DVD recorder you want to use as a source and which to record to. (I have two) Much better than recording to your computer then back to a disk when you are coppying a disk. Roxio has since dropped Drag to Disk from Creator 2010 on up. They say it isn't dependable. I say HOG WASH. I bought 9 and unistlled, bought 2010 and got my money back in favor of 7.5 because I couldn't scan a disk for errors and fix it with 9 or 2010. (You can only do that if you haven't ""closed the disk."") I LOVE my Easy Media Creator 7.5 and wouldn't use anything else."

16435,0,"There are plenty of reviews so I'll try to tell you something from the point of view of a non-programmer/home user who wanted an easy to use program to run a basic web page. Specifically, I wanted to be able to change a page and have the program automatically update links in every other page. I also wanted to be able to change hosts without updating every link piece by piece. The problem is, the way I understand it, that it only does this if you are using a web site host that uses FrontPage &quot;extensions&quot;. They are not as common as Microsoft would like you to think they are and often cost more. Another case of Microsoft trying to dominate (and control) yet another aspect of the web. Even for basic web design, the WYSIWYG feature is very nice and the program is easy to use, but you pay for it. Also, I expected to be able to anchor a picture anywhere on a page but I still don't think that's possible. They could easily add some more capability (easy link updates) for the low end user who doesn't use their &quot;extensions&quot; and doesn't mind spending the extra money for the program."
80189,1,"I started using this product with my garmin, and it was decent, the one really cool thing about it was that I could upload photos after my trip and then share the trip online. Sharing trips online is awesome because I can email them to my friends... I almost didn't buy this product because of the a bad review on this site, but decided to give it a try anyway, and I'm glad I did. After playing with it for a while I bought a nextel phone, and it was even better... I could send trips, routes, points, maps, etc all to my phone overthe air... started leaving my garmin at home and doing it all with my cell phone. Really cool stuff... I would suggest after buying to go and get the latest version from their website... seems to get a little better each version, and you can upgrade for free!"

64935,1,"After reading the reviews on here, I was undecided on whether to upgrade from Elements 2.0 or not. I was swayed by two rebates offerred by Adobe and Amazon, and now that I've used 3.0 for a while I would say it is worth my (discounted) upgrade price.Big Plus - the Healing Brush is great, and has make working with damaged photo scans much easier for me.Big Plus - the Red Eye removal tool is much improved from earlier versions. Since I'm not an ""image professional"" I really don't want to spend 10 or 20 steps to remove red-eye, and this version of PE does a good job almost every time with a single click.Don't Care (for me) - not interested in the Organizer tool.Minus - PE 3.0 forces install of Organizer whether you want it or not. Once installed, the Organizer assumes that any file you edit is to be added to it. This tool simply gets in my way, and there is no way to disable the Organizer tool or prevent it from being installed.Overall, I am happy with PE 3.0. But the high upgrade price and forced Organizer tool prevent me from giving this product the best rating."
16196,1,"If you've never taken a single Spanish course, then this is not the software set for you. While the packaging notes that it is for beginners as well as intermediate and advanced learners, the reality is that the beginner's lessons are considerably advanced. The software appears to have been designed with the understanding that a user has at least some background information-- vocabulary for body parts, numbers, and places in addition to the conjugation of verbs in the present indicative and an understanding of feminine versus masculine articles/endings. To jump into this software without a couple basic lessons under your belt will leave you beyond frustrated.However, if you've had some exposure and are looking to clean up your grammar and add some depth to your conversation, this set is an unbelievable bargain. The sheer volume and diversity of types of practice exercises will give you hundreds of hours of quality practice. The ability to hear proper pronunciation and check your own quickly becomes an indispensable tool.As long as this is just one of many tools in your arsenal of educational aids for learning the language, you'll walk away impressed and thoroughly satisfied."

Similar problems have happened elsewhere."
91346,1,My old orange Betty Crocker book is one of my favorite all time cookbooks. I didn't have a program for my computer so I gave this one a shot. It's not a bad program...tons of recipes and all that. You click on a food on the left side of the screen and it brings up all the recipes for that food on the right side. There's even a helpful hints section for a well stocked panty. The only negative is that I wish there were more color photos. Not all recipes have one. I still like that visual picture when I'm looking for a recipe.

10447,1,"Sibelius has been my score writter of choice since I purchased it 18 months ago. As a professional musician, teacher, and copyist, I have found this program invaluable.It is easy to learn and speed increases with many one key shortcuts that are intuitive. Three methods of input, mouse (slowest), keybord (faster), MIDI keyboard (fastest), are available to the user. The program follows all modern conventions in music notation and allows the user to change these as desired. The newest version (1.4) supports importing scores from Finale, a great help for professional copyists that have scores in that difficult program's format. It can also import MIDI files and transcribe them to a Sibelius score, and save a file in MIDI format."
1422,1,"Bought this for my mother. She's running Windows 7 and has Office 2003. The local cable company would no longer support Outlook 2003 because Microsoft no longer updates it and the cable company could not guarantee security. Without Outlook, and getting her mail through the cable company server only, she was getting all this spam that she wasn't used to. Outlook Express was not an option, Windows 7 does not support that. Backed up her Outlook 2003, installed Outlook 2007, and all of her mail, folders, and address book went right into the new Outlook. No major problems, it did what it was supposed to do and Mom is ecstatic. It has things she will probably never use, but also has some new features that she's come to like."

15383,1,"Although I'm not a linguist or language teacher, foreign languages are my passion. I've pursued, to varying degree of mastery, successful study of six foreign languages via methods ranging from independent study with books to private tutorials to university classes with language labs. But using computer software is new for me. This Transparent CD-ROM language course blows the other methods out of the water-I can scarcely contain my excitement.The Transparent course is presented in four modules or ""titles"": Most Common Words, Survival Phrases, the Polish Family and Discovering Poland. The latter two are actually lengthy articles with video components. You may study the titles in any order you wish and concentrate on any aspect of Polish, whether it be spelling and orthography, grammar and syntax, pronunciation or vocabulary. The program is incredibly flexible and you can customize the titles to reflect your preferences.If your primary interest is speaking the language, you can concentrate on interactive dialogues (you will need a sound card on your computer) and hide the text. You can even record yourself speaking and compare your pronunciation with that of the speakers in the program. If you want only reading knowledge of Polish, you can hide the sound and video components and read only the text.If you want full reading and speaking facility, though, this is where the flexibility of this course comes into play. If you get bored memorizing phrases, for example, you can switch over to interactive dialogues or pronunciation exercises. And if you want to test your knowledge, the program offers numerous fun games (unscramble, crossword puzzles, etc.) that you customize as to content-plus you can track your scores to mark your progress.Not having studied Polish before, I am essentially a beginner. Yet I have already mastered the basics of Polish pronunciation (which is difficult if you haven't studied Slavic languages) and can recognize lots of basic words just by their sound. Having studied Greek and Latin, there wasn't going to be much to stump me grammar-wise about Polish. But Polish grammar is quite complex. For those wishing to explore grammar, there are concise explanations on noun declension, verb conjugation, adverb formation, etc. In the text contained in the titles, the root form of the highlighted word will be shown in a separate box along with, for nouns, the case, number and gender and, for verbs, the person, number, aspect and tense.This course is intended for beginners or early-intermediate students of Polish. If you studied Polish at a university for two years, you would probably find this course useful only for review or pronunciation practice. If you wish to pursue Polish seriously, you will also want to acquire a good Polish grammar (easy to find) and a good Polish-English dictionary (not so easy to find)."
23968,1,"I originally bought this software when I had Windows ME. It worked really well and I loved it. It's simple to use--click the icon and you are ready to look up words. When I got a new computer which came with Windows XP, my original software would not work. I bought a new version thinking my old version just was not compatible. As it turns out, there is some issue with all versions of the software working with XP. Topics Entertainment is aware of the issue, but unable to resolve it. Topics Entertainment had a relatively friendly and helpful technical support department (though somewhat slow) and they offered to take the software back after the problem failed to be resolved. But that still leaves me without my much-missed dictionary program. If you don't have XP, then I highly recommend this program. If you have XP, find an alternative (which I am searching for presently.)"

When I called Microsoft they said, and I quote; ""Well, we've got no control over errors until our development team takes time to fix them. Sometimes our products get sent out in such a short time frame and that hurts our ability to produce a quality product""Basicly what I got from customer service was a ""I don't care, but I understand"" kind of reply.Futher errors you'll come across with this software is that it's missing files. A update will not replace these files and re-installing the software will only force you re-enter all of your personal information and start all over again.The files that are missing are cruical to the operation of the program like certain scripts that allow for printing and designing custom invoices.

25003,0,"What board game could be more American classic than monopoly? And MONOPOLY 3 brings it to your pc! No more playing alone as 3 different players for days and days (yes...I did this as a child, before the age of technology). There are cute graphics and animations, nice sound effects and voices (albeit a bit repetitious after hours of play), options galore that allow you to play with all sorts of different rules and with the Monopoly city versions of 10 cities (where the street names are names of places in that city etc). Basically if you loved Monopoly you will find this a good replacement to whining on your friends to play with you. But it does only seem to appeal to lovers of the game. Not to mention that there are issues with the game ""cheating"", and doesn't allow for different levels of difficulty. I believe the patch sorts some of these issues out, and they are eliminated completely when you play over the net. That's the real fun - playing with other Monopoly fanatics ;).Despite a lot of bad reviews on Amazon, I find myself enjoying Monopoly immensely from time to time when I get that sudden board game urge. But if you have never thought once in the past year ""oh I'd like to play monopoly"", I wouldn't recommend purchasing it."

I have to say I am very happy with it. It offers basic protection, doesn't hog system resource and slow down your system like Norton, and it doesn't always get into your way. The sad thing is the major computing media doesn't give much review to Trend Micro's product, perhaps because Trend Micro isn't a big advertising dollar contributor like Symantec and McAfee. Get this program and you won't regret."
34997,1,I installed it in my new computer with the easy to follow steps and I find that it gives me wonderful protection. I would recommend this product to everyone. I am very satisfied. I feel my computer is very well protected.
32653,0,"First, before you buy this product, you should understand that it is NOT intended to replace good, high-detail paper topo maps. Relying simply on a sensitive piece of electronic equipment without a good map and compass in the backcountry is not a well-advised decision. (""Whoops! Shouldn't have dropped my GPS on those rocks."" ""Darn! Coulda sworn I packed extra batteries!"" You get the picture.)That said, I've found it to be an excellent supplement to 1:24,000 paper maps. The detail is surprisingly good; I recently completed a section of the Continental Divide Trail in Colorado and found most (but not all) of the trail information from the 7.5' maps on the GPS map. It's nice to be able to instantly correlate your position between the GPS and a paper map, and the contour lines simply make it easier to visualize your position. It also shows points of interest like small lakes and rivers, and even old mines and such. The contour lines do not always perfectly jive up with higher-detail maps, but are close enough. There does seem to be a problem with not enough contour lines at higher magnifications, so you won't want to zoom in too close if you want to see the lay of the land on your unit. Position accuracy, however, was very good and appeared just about spot-on with my paper maps.Installation is easy and the data meshes seamlessly with other MapSource products (well, City Select, anyway, which is the other MapSource product I currently own). My Garmin GPS60CS holds a tremendous amount of topographical information in its 64 MB internal memory; I fit in almost the entire west half of Colorado plus City Select info for numerous cities between Colorado and Michigan.One big downside to having so much information loaded is that map-drawing times are achingly slow on my unit, especially if detail is set on Most and Declutter is set to Off. I found that by unselecting topo information for areas I didn't need, drawing times were improved substantially, though still a bit irritating. Scrolling to a new area and waiting for the map to catch up can be tedious. I usually leave Declutter on unless I need a particular detail in an area.I did not have the opportunity (or the need) to map routes using this software. I have done so with City Select and found it simple and effective, but don't know how this will translate into Topo. I've heard and read that the National Geographic maps are better for route mapping, but your results may vary. I suspect that this is due in large part to the fact that NatGeo maps are 1:24,000 in detail, much higher than USA Topo, so errors will naturally be smaller. Thus far I have not needed to map routes, as I rely on my map and compass more than my electronics for detailed positioning (and my pencil never runs out of batteries), with my GPS as a verification device. I can see where this would be an issue, however, if you do a lot of off-trail exploring or otherwise have the need for a detailed, precise route through tricky country.Value-wise I'd say USA Topo qualifies as very good, particularly in light of the fact that Garmin tends to nickel-and-dime you to death with all of their maps and accessories. However, you can get USA Topo online for 75 or 80 bucks, and that includes topo information for all 50 states.My conclusion is that as an advanced, standalone navigation tool for backcountry climing, canyoneering, and other off-trail stuff, USA Topo is a poor choice. It's fine for trail-hikers and those that don't go bushwhacking, but still no replacement for a good 1:24,000 paper map. However, if you use it as a supplemental tool and recognize its limitations, it's just dandy."
81547,1,"I bought this to upgrade from StarOffice 7 to 8. I've always been very happy with StarOffice as a less-expensive alternative to MS Office. The default format in version 7 was StarOffice format. In version 8, it's open-document format. So far, I've been able to open any MS Office 2000 document in StarOffice 8 without any serious differences. My only complaint with this product is that, even with the ""Quickstarter"" running in the system tray, the program takes twice as long as MS Office to open. If Sun could make it launch as fast or faster than MS, I would gladly give it five stars."
22462,2,"I've been a Quicken user since Managing Your Money evaporated. I've been upgrading to the new annual versions every year in the hope the product defects and in-program advertising were either eliminated or corrected. They get worse every year. If you want to use the simplest portions of the program, it'll probably be okay for you. But if you use it for all your household finances, you'll find frustrating problems that the manufacturer doesn't seem to want to correct and they charge for support. Free support is available online, but after hours of writing back and forth with support personnel, most problems are handled with the description, &quot;Product Defect&quot;. Good luck, and checkout other programs. Better yet, write Andrew Tobias an email and ask him to bring Managing Your Money back."
21858,1,"As a designer and builder of children's playhouses, I was looking for an easy-to-use CAD program to assist in the creation of these structures. I have found 3D Home Architect to be a fairly good program for a novice CAD user.As some of the reviews here have noted, the program is not as intuitive as it might otherwise have been; the 3D rendering could be A LOT faster; and I found the User Guide to have some errors (some of which were corrected on the website as technical notes. One of the corrections though--for a gable roof over a dormer--did not supply the correct answer either. Customer Support, however, did provide a quick and accurate response).For the average homeowner, this program is excellent. It also serves my needs in designing custom playhouses. I would have liked to have seen some of the features offered in Chief Architect 7.0 [...] but I have been pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.By the way, a free, functional demo version of CA 7.0 is available for download, but it is limited in that you cannot save or print your plans, amongst some other limitations."

Once Spirit is out though, they find it easier."

32953,1,"Putt-Putt is invited to participate in a race. He needs to collect four pieces of equipment to be in the race. By keeping his eyes open, earning some extra money, and helping others in cartown, he is able to gather those materials. My 3.5 yr-old son loves this game. The first few times he played the game, my husband and I played it with him, helping him think through some of the challenges and encouraging him to notice details that could help him towards his goals (e.g., collecting pop bottles to recycle towards money for his racing tires). This was especially important since Max can't read yet, so he wouldn't notice clues such as the &quot;free&quot; sign on the batteries in the toy store, or the &quot;help wanted&quot; sign at the grocery. After three or four games played with us, he was able to start playing the game independently. The challenges vary a little from game to game. Sometimes he earns a helmet by helping a cat out of a tree, other times by hammering nails. There is usually an animal to go research in the library (we help with the reading). The game can be saved, which is great because when Max plays by himself he meanders a bit more through cartown and it helps to break the game up over two or three evenings. Putt-putt models polite language and a positive demeanor. There are no bad guys."
38386,1,"What's not to like. It is the dominant gaming operating system for now. The full version will repair windows in the event of a crash, as opposed to the OEM version from the computer vendor (or purchased), which requires a total reinstallation, including all other applications on the hard drive in question. I had an OEM disk, but opted for a new full version with repair capability to avoid any future total reinstallations. Some of my current games and applications would not reinstall on my desktop computer and are lost, but, oddly, as a test, installed on my laptop with Windows XP Pro.A new computer, to arrive soon, has Vista for the OS and I'll be able to compare."

69135,2,"I've been signing for almost ten years, and my wife works professionally as an interpreter. I recently picked this package up as a handy refresher to keep my skills sharp. For under $$$, it seemed like a good deal. Unfortunately, this suite of ""learning tools"" left a lot to be desired. First of all, if you're using XP, expect a whole slew of compatibility problems. The few programs I was able to get working suffered from very poor interface design, and worse yet, presented the user with incorrect information. For example, the Personal Communicator lets the user type in English phrases to get a video ASL interpretation. What the program displayed for you was a literal English word-order translation of the phrase. Words that did not appear in the sparse word list were then fingerspelled. There was absolutely no consideration of ASL grammar or structure. Thus, a sentence like ""How long have you been an interpreter?"" was translated with the literal signs for ""how"" (as in, ""how does this work?""), ""long"" (as in ""that road is long""), ""have"" (as in ""can I have some water?""), and so on. If you've ever taken a real ASL course, you know how wrong this is. A true ASL representation should have read something like ""interpreter how-long (time) you?"" In all fairness, creating a program advanced enough to do such an accurate conversion would probably cost much more, but by presenting new ASL students with this sort of misrepresentation is destructive to the language rather than constructive. Another program, the English-ASL dictionary, is nothing more than a copy of a University of Michigan ASL web site, not a carefully designed learning aid for home use.Bottom line, if you're really serious about learning this wonderful language, do yourself a favor and enroll in a class at a local college or community center. It is the ONLY way to truly learn this language and begin to experience deaf culture. If you want to practice at home, I would recommend The American Sign Language Dictionary 10th Anniversary Edition. It's far more accurate and does a much better job of teaching ASL grammar, deaf culture, and sign vocabulary."
32340,1,"This collection of fonts is a good solid collection of fonts for print and for general use. There is a good variety from Gothic, sans serif, Roman, Blackletter, modern, there are some cartoon fonts, comic fonts, and a whole range, etc.If you are using these fonts for personal use or non commercial business use, these fonts will be great.The bad thing though is that these fonts are proprietary and copyrighted, and there are limitations as to their use. You are not allowed to use them for commercial purposes i.e. use them on anything that is to be sold, which I think is bad. If for example, you want to create a T-shirt design and you use the fonts in this collection with your design and you want to sell the T-shirts, that would be illegal.Most software I use especially 3D modeling software, sound editing software, etc. allow you to use the content any way you wish provided you do not sell the original content itself, in this case to sell the actual fonts themselves. (In my 3D modeling software, you can use the content commercially so long as you do not copy and sell the software itself or the original content itself or modified versions of the original content i.e. meshes and such, which is fair, someone worked hard to make all of those meshes, but you can make your own original characters from the software and content and those are yours to use as you wish.) So I don't like this particular fact. I can understand not allowing someone to sell or publicly distribute the original fonts themselves; someone worked hard to create them, and they deserve their credit and royalties and of course should get paid for their work, but not to allow you the user to use them in printed matter to be sold I think is unreasonable. The printed matter is copyrighted by the one who wrote the material and the fonts are just the medium that the material is being written with.I am going to eventually invest in font editor/creator software so I can create my own fonts from scratch and then I can use both the fonts and printed material any way I wish without restriction at all."
12106,0,"Beware of who you listen to. Mr. Top 500 Reviewer likes to spout off big words (in the eyes of the consumer) and make false statements of &quot;the first 32bit OS&quot;. To correct, you will find that Windows 2000 went to great lenths to cater to the demands of 16bit applications, being a 32bit OS itself.Aside from the technical stuff, Windows XP is an operating system geared for the ignorant. For those who like to build their own systems or stray from the &quot;normal&quot; PC user, XP is not the solution. Just ask anyone who tries to set up multiple hard drives on their computer. Microsoft Tech will even tell you that you need multiple copies of their OS.Bottom line, you cannot go wrong with XP on OEM versions, it is the solution to ME. But for those who want a Microsoft &quot;hands-off&quot; system, stick with 2000.One other note, &quot;XP&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot; do not belong in the same sentence.

16100,1,"I got the Platinum version of QuickVerse PDA, but this review should apply to all the 2007 versions of QuickVerse PDA. Like most of the desktop PC versions of Bible Study software, the basic program is the same, and the higher priced versions simply contain more Bibles and other reference works. This is fair, as the more modern books that are included, the more copywrite fees the publisher has to pay.I have used several other Palm and PocketPC Bible Study programs before getting QuickVerse PDA. These were primarily book readers that would let you read one Bible translation or reference work at a time, and had a few extra features like letting you add your own notes to a verse, or automatically look up some of the reference works by verse number. QuickVerse takes this to a whole new level by allowing you to tap on individual words and look up every reference work that relates to that word or topic. It also lets you jump from one translation to another and automatically stay at the same chapter and verse. Overall, it's still not as full featured as the various desktop PC programs, but it is a big step closer. I read one review that said QuickVerse PDA was unacceptably slow. I'm using it with a Palm Treo that has a 300 Mhz processor and a fast 40X Secure Digital card. With that combination it only takes a second or so to load a new book for viewing. With older Palm devices, it might well take several seconds to change screens. While this is slow compared to a desktop PC, it's still a lot faster than flipping through pages and looking it up in a paper book. Or, more accurately, a stack of books.While the program that lives on the Palm itself works great, QuickVerse did a lousy job of supporting the installation for Palm devices. QuickVerse PDA is supposed to include various multimedia features, both audio clips and photos. However, the multimedia features have a separate installer that only works with PocketPC's. There is no provision for installing this material on Palm devicess at all. The installation program should also present you with a list of which Bibles and books you want installed (if your Palm has limited memory, you may not have room for everything). You're left figuring this out for yourself. All the Bibles and reference material can be loaded onto a Secure Digital or Compact Flash card, but QuickVerse didn't use the standard Palm locations for storing data. So if you try to use the Palm Desktop to install extra books straight into the storage card, QuickVerse won't be able to find them. You have to install everything into the Palm's main memory, then let the QuickVerse PDA program itself transfer the books from the Palm's main memory to the storage card. This is quite easy to do, but it isn't documented at all (go to the Book Menu, tap on a book and select transfer from the pop-up menu). Please note that, except for the multimedia features, everything can be properly installed on a Palm device. QuickVerse just made doing so a lot more trouble than it should have been. If you happen to own a Mac, then everything can be installed using a Mac running OSX, you just have to select all the parts manually.Based on how well QuickVerse PDA runs on a Palm, I would expect that it should work fine on a PocketPC as well. The program is a great tool for serious Bible study, and allows you to carry a whole library for doing so in your pocket."

51962,1,"I had no experience with Captivate (or Flash/Dreamweaver/any other Macromedia product) when I began using it to produce some training movies, and was nonethless able to get up and running, and do productive work very rapidly. Macromedia has great docs and some wonderful tutorials/helps on their web site which also helped. But the program itself is intuitive and pretty simple to use (at least compared to others that I've experienced in the past).One very pleasant surprise I've learned is that you can do a great deal of editing to captured slides, without having to recapture another session. You can cut and paste other graphics onto your slides, and even merge them into the background, to permanently cover up certain artifacts and blurps that you'd rather not let the user see.The program also automatically highlights buttons and text boxes that you might select and use during the capture session, which saves you the time of having to create those yourself. The program also lets you configure a great number of options -- it takes a little effort to learn them all, but doing so can save a great deal of time as well.NOTE: The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I've experienced a few crashes when trying to publish movies. Happily, everything is still saved, and the movie does get successfully published, but the program just ups and dies without any error messages. (It seems to happen when I put links in to other movies, but that's just a guess right now.) So while it's a fatal error, at least you don't lose any work, and you can restart Captivate just fine afterwards without any problems. Nonetheless, it shouldn't happen.And now that I think of it, every so often the program seems to get confused when you're doing a lot of scrolling and other motion/screen changes, and a slide shows the previous slide's background instead of the new one. This is rare, though, and can be easily fixed by going to a slide with the right background, copying that, and pasting it as the new background on the incorrect slide. So it's an inconvenience, but easily fixed.Neither of these problems are really serious and I'd expect them to be fixed with the next major release. (I'm using release 1.01, by the way.)"

91441,1,"I was a fan of the movies and the early 90's cartoon, but didn't really have access to comic books as a kid. (Allowance was too small.)This was a great way to catch up on the X-Men, and it's entertaining to read the early stories where they're a bunch of teenagers who hang out at a beatnik club.As others have said, in the mid 80's the stories start to get very disjointed due to the missed issues in crossover series and spinoff's. (For example, in a crossover series of 7 comic books, you may get the first and sixth issue.) By the time you get to the 90's there's a whole comic book series called ""X-Men"" that you're not getting. Why? Because this is the ""Uncanny X-Men"" and the other series is just ""X-Men"". (The x-men are split up into two teams at this point.) Confused? Me too. Lots of things that I always thought were major X-Men storylines (like the Apocalypse story) actually happen in the other series.Weird: In the late 80's the X-men are in a very strange space. The team is full of forgettable characters like cyclops' brother Havok, the mulletted Longshot (whose mutant power is ""getting lucky"") and the pre-ninjafied Psylocke. Oh, and they all live in Australia.Still, the dvd is worth it, as the series is pretty interesting up until 1985 or so."

It sits there and scans the same Temporary Zip files, over and over and over again. You have to abort the scan, which kind of defeats the purpose of performing a system scan.Considering that it has captured 5 computer viruses in my email inbox this week alone, VirusScan is still a worthwhile program; I just hate to see Network Associates join the other big software companies in marketing annoying software that is not yet ready for prime time."

9953,1,"This is the fourth movie editing package that I have tried (Premiere Elements, Pinnacle, Videowave) and I would have to say it is the best by a fair margin, especially with regard to the features offered, that actually work. So far the package has proved robust to import, edit and export. Quality of the video handling software seems impressive. The package is more complex and less intuitive than others, but is more rewarding when you finally work out the way forward. The price is exceptional when you look at the depth of features.Unfortunately the program let itself down for me when it came to burning disks. In this respect the program is so useless, I am not convinced there is actually any code behind those burn buttons. I used several different export file formats and burn modes and without fail, the process failed, in a variety of different ways mind you to keep me amused but not one success. I think the only code under the burn option is a make believe timer/progress bar to make you think it is beavering away writing data to disk, when in fact the process dozes off into hibernation....anyway, I just used a 3rd party package for burning and I am away...so am basically happy with the product with this work around."

I installed in on a 3 yr old computer for my wife to use as a recruiter. It does the tasks she needed it for and it seems pretty stable.She has 10,000 contact records and uses email continuously. It links to her pda and the contacts synch to the pda. It also synchs to a laptop, so she can travel with her whole database. I also have it synch to a second computer as a backup.If there was a better or easier to use product for the same functionality I would like to know about it, but I haven't found it.Act 2007 is pretty sophisticated and can support many users and be integrated for workgroup collaboration either on site, or over the internet. I think 2008 is pretty much the same think, but works with Vista.The problems are two fold. 1) Sage is not very good at supporting the product. Be warned, you will most likely need a few calls to sage to get it working properly. One problem is that it will take you 30- 90 min to get to tech support, mostly in India. They are only open from around 8:30 - 8 pm, est.2)The other problem is that the free support is only good for the 1st 30 days. After that you pay. cost is $65 per incident, or $200 for a year (up to 5 incidents) or $300 unlimited. I wound up paying to get support to install it on the laptop, and then again to install it on a newer faster computer. The old one was too slow (compaq xp-3000, 1.5 gb.).the new puter is Dell X2-4200 with 2 gb memory. I installed a WD raptor 10,000 rpm drive which also made a difference and the app works pretty quickly. So if you are serious about act, get the fastest computer you can afford, and consider a WD Raptor drive to install it on.The software has some bugs to start with. I installed in on 3 computers and only by the 3rd try could I get it on my own. Don't even try to use the one on the cd you get. Download the (updated) trial version from the web site and use your license #.It is a pretty useful business tool, but the purchase price is just your first cost. If you are willing to spend the $$ and the time, it can be worthwhile, but buying and using it is not the typical user experience that one would expect (ie easy, free , or minimal cost product support and a product that works out of the box).One of the other benefits is that there are many (extra cost) products and consultants who have built a business around add ins and customization, so the product can do a lot. If you use it as a business tool, it may be worth while. It is not for casual use.When you get to support, they give you a case number. The case numbers are sequential. they are up to 9.4 million! they increase by around 10,000 per week i think. they are making money on the support, not on the software.good luck."
78525,2,"What a disappointment!! I was so hoping Adobe would get present enough to upgrade their Aldus acquisition to better integrate with their other outstanding tools (Illustrator & Photoshop), creating a viable alternative to QuarkXPress ..... Instead we got the same old over-complicated, clunky, RAM-devouring, tool-challenged reason we kept going back to Quark to begin with. I won't go into depth about the problems with the program, because it never had that much going for it to begin with, and you can see plenty of coverage of its shortcomings in the other reviews. All I can say is, don't do what I did: I talked my boss into buying it for our art department because I felt we needed an Adobe alternative to Quark, and it was a BIG mistake - we will never use it, and it will no doubt come out of my pay check. Grrr ........On the upside, Adobe may have made up for this long-overdue-for-retirement publishing debacle with its new InDesign; now THAT program ROCKS. Now don't just take my word for it ..... go to Adobe's site, download the free 30-day tryout, and just watch the future unfold before your eyes. But if you've ever considered getting PageMaker, please just save your money and watch it go extinct like it should have about ten years ago."
77302,1,"Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9 is giving me the edge I need to be able to trascribe handwritten text (by someone else) into editable copy and eventually manuscript form for a self-published book. I'm one who reads instructions only if necessary. Contrary to some initial advice that I would need professional tutoring to learn, by just following the tutorials after installing, within a short time I felt I had DNS9 to at least 75% accuracy. Even with the back-tracking to 'scratch that' or 'delet that' and redo on a frequent basis at first, it still is faster and more accurate than what I can do on my own. As I continue to use and work with DNS9, it's accuracy continues to improve. I expect the 99% to be attained before I'm through with this project. .......... The fact that I do not have to sit at the keyboard in the traditional sense is a huge blessing!! .......... I highly recommend this product! JUST REMEMBER, IT DOES TAKE TIME & PATIENCE TO GET TO THE 99% ACCURACY, BUT THE EFFORT IS WELL REWARDED."
94270,2,"This product has disappointed me several times. First, ROXIO's Easy CD Creator 5 was advertised to be a complete solution to backing up my computer by using a option, ""Take Two"". This is advertised to make a complete ""Image"" of my computer and place it on a CD (burner Installed) for back-up purposes. The problem, the program hangs up my computer at times...after several months after purchase, ROXIO say's, we have problems and will no longer support this feature and recomends not using it!!!The next disappointing feature is used to record audio from a cassette or other external source. When one tries to enter a title of the music to be recorded (via Spin Doctor/SoundStream 2)the program hangs up my computer!!!Roxio support for this product is poor...and makes me think twice about other products by this producer. I have finally uninstalled Easy CD Creator 5 and will look into other products not associated with this producer."
94700,0,"I love my print version of Britiannica but the DVD Ultimate reference was a big disappointment. The user interface is terrible, with the article itself occupying only a small window surrounded by variouss navigation controls. It is hard to quickly scan or read a large article without frequent clicking and scrolling.The main problem is its slowness- Why is it that google can search the internet in 0.1 seconds while Britannica on a Mac 1.33GHz G4 takes ages (actually about 20s) to load and 5-10s to search for and view an article ?I hope that the PC implementation works better, but I fear that the great work of many authors has been let down by very poor software implentation."

For some reason, that game (which is previewed on the Cars DVD) which is more of a racing game with additional mini-games, most of which are fun, is ONLY available from Target. I like the movie Cars, and as an adult, have really enjoyed playing the OTHER Cars video game, exclusively available through Target.But, if what you are looking for is an activity center for kids who like the movie Cars, this is decent."
49595,1,"In my personal categorization of Bible Software there are three main classes - First, you have the commerical ""bigwigs"" - Logos, QuickVerse, Bibleworks, etc. Some of these are good, some are bad. Most cost hundreds of dollars.Second, you have ""commercial but affordable software"", usually written by one person or a small group of people. There are actually very few Bible software packages that fall into this class that I could find, though SwordSearcher is one of them.Third, you have freeware and shareware packages, also usually written by a small group of people. Packages in this class range from awful to very good, with the best one being eSword.In my experience, for the average lay person wanting to engage in a deeper study of Scripture, the quality of software in the latter two classes often rivals that of the big commercial hotshots. I found out the hard way. After spending $200 on one of the big packages I found myself continuously frustrated attempting to do even the basics - searching, cross referencing, storing of my own notes, etc. I held out longer than I should have simply because I spent so much money on the dumb thing. But in the end the pain won out and I sold it to some poor soul on eBay.But now what to do? SwordSearcher to the rescue! For the money, SwordSearch is one of the best values out there. It's strengths are its clean and efficient interface and its search options. The effectiveness and ease of Swordsearcher's various search and indexing features simply wipes the floor with any other package I've used, freeware, shareware, or commercial. Its the only product I found that allows you to search for a specific word, topic, or verse reference across all Bibles, books, commentaries, and personal study notes with one fell swoop.Another nice feature is it's Verse List, which consolidates all the verses from a search, or from a particular book entry, into its own pane. This allows you to actually do more with the verses without losing sight of the original list or having to work around a search results popup window.It comes with a wide range of commentaries, dictionaries, and books, some more useful than others. However, the software is KJV-only, so if you're looking to compare various translations you won't find it here. This may or may not be a negative for you. The only other real negative that I could find is the included maps and images - they are old and archaic, and seem very out of place in such an otherwise fine product. This is easily remedied, however, by visting the swordsearcher_help yahoo group and downloading some updated maps and images. These are the only two reasons it did not garner a 5-star rating from me.Even though I am not a ""KJV-only"" person, I have found SwordSearcher to be such a compelling product that I use it almost exclusively for my day-to-day study and collection of my personal commentary, notes, and illustrations. I usually only hop out of SwordSearcher to eSword when I want to do a translation comparison with some modern translations.All in all, I highly recommend SwordSearcher."
90080,1,"I finally took the plunge and installed Panther yesterday morning on a G4 Powerbook. Originally I was going to wait until my week off of school for the upcoming Chinese New Year because I thought I may need the time to fix any problems if the installation was not successful. Previous reading through many Mac forums had led me to believe that I would more than likely have a myriad of problems.After carefully reviewing many forum posts, I decided that I would do an ""archive and install."" Having done some simple disk maintenance (ran repair disk permissions on the disk utility) and backed up all important files the night before, I awoke at 5:30 this morning ready to install. Trembling with both anticipation and fear, I turned on the computer and inserted the first installation disc. Following all directions onscreen, I was amazed and delighted with the ease of installation. Still not convinced of my success, I held off jumping for joy until the computer had been restarted and I had the chance to check everything out. Because of the archive and install, all my preferences were saved, I lost nothing, and didn't even have to reconfigure my comuter for the wireless connection at home.Internet Explorer, which I rarely use, loaded more quickly, and Safari, which I use 99% of the time, was even faster than before. I had a look at a WebQuest page I had made, and all the animated graphics were working very well, whereas before in Safari, only one was animated. I did have to re-install Norton Anti-Virus, but the installer was still on the computer, so that was very simple as well. I've downloaded all available updates, and the OS is very stable thus far. To print, I didn't have to do any reinstalls, rather I just plugged the printer cable into the USB port, and voila, successful printing!Panther appears to be a great operating system, so much better than Windows XP, which I use (and regularly curse) on the machines at school. If you are thinking of making the switch, by all means go for it!"
427,1,Easy CD Creator would not work on my system. I uninstalled and reinstalled the blasted thing and it still would not make my CD burner burn. So I installed this product called RecordNow Max. It worked the first time. Now I'm burning my own CD's like a madman. Very good product.

13897,1,"I'm 36 and never learned how to type. I figured I'd try and since the Mavis Beacon series seem to be the most popular, I got this one, despite some reviews describing installation problems.Sure enough, when I installed it, it wouldn't run. You basically need to set it up to run in Win98 or Win2000 compatibility mode, at 640x480 resolution. Reboot, and Voila!So it's been 3 days, and even though my speed dropped quite a bit with learning the proper fingers, I'm typing properly. And the speed is coming back fast.The classes are very well designed, it's actually pretty amazing how efficient it is, and fun on top of it.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the compatibility issues. How hard can it be for their engineers to update their engine?!"
68072,2,I've downloaded the trial version of this software. My main goal was to help speed up my computer and at the same time make it more stable. That is what System Mechanic 7 advertises. I've had it on my computer for just 2 weeks of the 30 day trial. The problem happened when my computer told me I had a corrupt file. I ran the SM7 and it found errors and supposedly fixed them. It showed that my computer was in good health and good security. The problem is when I rebooted Windows XP would no longer load up. I tried the recovery disk that they claim could fix the problems. The problem with that is their recovery disk in not a bootable disk. So I had to reinstall Windows XP to get my computer working again.So my advise for anyone looking for a software suite that fixes problems is to keep looking. This one is not worth the money if it can't keep your computer from crashing.

2390,2,"Remember when you first got Windows Me, how people installed it and how much BSOD, ""Blue Screen of Death"" you got every time you used it. Sometimes it just would give u a memory error even when you had enough ram to run 7 things at once. Well thats how Gigastudio 3.0 is except - worse. It crashes uncontrollably and as soon as it begins to work something else happens. It either freezes up or crashes the pc. I have a Dual Core 2 Pentium 4 3.04 gigahertz pc with 2 gigs of ram and enough space on hardrive. Everything is updated on my pc and yes Tascam Corp. I turned off virus scan when running this program - not that Avast has anything to do with the programs problems with crashes as a whole. Anyway, it doesn't matter how good your system is; that won't do any good. I built this system especially for it and it crashed like crazy. I don't know what is worst. I can't even load instruments on it let alone get to use it often. I am defiantly returning this and those of you who got it to work I wonder how. I have an Audiophile 2496 Maudio Gsif, and Asio 2 compatible sound card and still Gigastudio 3.0 gives me hell. I decided that maybe Tascam should consider finishing development of their software without just distributing it bug-infested. Kontakt 2 never crashed on me and most other music samplers didn't either. But Gigastudio is a different, one of the worst products I got and it just makes me think what the software coders were thinking when they created this product.... I rate this program a 2 out of 5. The 2 is for the packaging and beautiful look.... If your seriously thinking about getting this program just make sure you are ready for the frequent crashes, and the long wait on the phone for the CSR to answer you, don't bother emailing unless you are willing to wait a week to get an answer!!"
2244,0,"I have to confess-- I'm 15 and I bought this program, even though it's for little kids. I am really into animation and I thought it would be useful. Well, I was wrong, so if you were thinking the same thing, don't bother with this program. Here's a list of pros and cons:PROS:-Fun for making simple animation-Easy to create scenes with Disney characters already available in Magic Artist stamp bank- Fun Sketchbook with music- Great for little kids to mess around withCONS:-Stylus for the sketchboard is impossible to use, it draws on the computer screen even with it isn't touching the board. Drawings come out badly no matter what level of drawing you are at. Don't use this if you really want to make animation. When you draw on the sketchboard it only shows up the computer so it's also hard to draw ANYTHING."

55396,0,"This is my fifth year using Quicken TurboTax and it will be my third year using the state tax version. I'm sold on it. I can't imagine going back to pen and paper to do taxes. The program takes you step-by-step through the tax process by asking you questions about the various sections of the forms. It also prompts you to make you remember about things that may have slipped you mind, like other deductions. And, it makes suggestions for deductions that you may not have thought about. At the end of the process you can print out the forms for mailing in the traditional format or in a format that's easy for the IRS computers to read. In addition, you can opt to file electronicly. The help section IS very helpful. It actually makes sense of the rules and instructions for filing your taxes and explains the relevant sections of the tax code in easy to understand language. My one suggestion is that you have all your papers with you before you start the process. You can, of course, save your work and come back to finish or edit it, but it is a pain to be half way through and remember that your mortgage statement is two floors away.I'm giving it three stars instead of five because of the product activation. Bad job Intuit. However, the activation doesn't prevent you from installing on more than one computer but it does prevent you from printing or electronically filing from the second computer. Still, you can take your saved file from work or where ever and bring it home to print or file.I tried Taxcut this year because of the product activation on TurboTax. I had problems with it right off. It stated on the box that you could import TurboTax files but when I tried it wouldn't let me. The Taxcut web site suggested that this was a common problem and that you had to edit your TurboTax file (with TurboTax) to bring it down to a certain size. Still, it didn't tell you what that size was ok or really give you any idea on what to cut out. (I thought all of the our tax info was important).My advice: The activation stinks but TurboTax is still the best tax prep software."

The sequencer doesn't get any easier and the mixing console is very direct as is the patching if you want to fiddle with that. Thing is reason automatically patches things for you taking much of the drudger out of the mix.It doesn't handle live audio though, and that has been corrected with a new companion product, Record. I'm not sure if record works with Reason 3, but it works with Reason 4 out of the box.I coud go on but check out Reason 4 instead as I might write a review for that someday."

7837,0,"I downloaded the trial of this product to go along with Windows Vista Business. I have previously used Norton AntiVirus but the version I had was not compatable with Vista. I was drawn to OneCare because of its streamlined nature and the fact that it was made by Microsoft. My original thinking was that it would fit in well with the new operating system. After installing I was a bit disappointed.While it does integrate well, the program has certain settings that must be met in order for the system to be ""protected."" For instance, Internet Explorer 7.0's Phishing Filter must be turned on and, in my opinion, it slows internet browsing down significantly. Currently my status is on Yellow and probably will always be like that because I have disabled that feature. Other than that, I like the fact that it updates completely in the background and doesn't require any action at all.The tune-up feature sounds nice but Vista already has the ability to schedule automatic defragmenting. Good effort and concept but needs some revisions. It is oriented towards a novice computer user. I'm also not sure why Microsoft felt the need to brand the product under the Windows Live brand. ""Microsoft OneCare"" seems more straightforward."

I have it installed on 3 machines that run 1)Windows XP Pro 2)Windows Vista 32 bit and 3) Windows Vista 64 bit. It runs great on all of them.I am a college student enrolled for 3 consecutive courses in ASL, and after using SigningAvatar v.2 for several weeks, I am really pleased with how much it is helping me. I can make the person avatar be closer or further from me (smaller or larger),turn him (or Her - there's about 10 to choose from) all the way from left to right. This enables me to see the hands from any angle. I can also speed up or slow down the avatar's signing to whatever pace meets my level of proficiency.With a word-search textbox, I can ask it to finger spell the word, make the sign for a word, and put the sign into a sentence. Of course there is an alphabet roster on the bottom of the screen so anytime I need to, I can see the person avatar sign any letter of the alphabet. I highly recommend SigningAvatar to anyone who is serious about learning American Sign Language."

52616,1,"The look and feel of the software is pretty much the same as last year. However, navigating through the return is a little cumbersome. They try to dumb down the product so much that the user is pretty much forced to go through the interview screens. It is a pain to go to specific areas to input or edit because they keep taking you back to the canned interview screens for those sections. They should give the user the choice of doing a down and dirty input or using their guided entry. The disk comes with the DeductionPro program which in my opinion is a waste of downloading time. The only added benefit it provides is giving values for household items donated to charity. I don't know why TaxCut doesn't just incorporate the ""program"" into the tax return preparation and just make it seamless for the user.They could also improve on the final error check process. They show errors and warnings. When you review a warning, there is no link directly to the fix. I ended up deleting a form with a warning that I thought was unnecessary and ended up deleting my whole W-2 input which made my whole return wrong. It took me a while to figure out that I just needed to re-enter the W-2, but after spending hours on my return, that freaked me out a bit.Last note: you can still e-file with this version, but it costs $15.95 extra and you can add on a state return for $24.95. If you do need a state return, buying the bundled version will save you money.TAX LAW UPDATE: As of Feb 3, the IRS will accept returns using the new sales tax deduction and/or the new tuition credit. I was ultimately very happy with Tax Cut's performance. The worksheets still print awkwardly and were just a waste of paper, but they did add the option to print the return to review before e-filing which is a must. I also really like the email notification that your return has been received and then again when it has been accepted along with a link where you can track your refund.I recommend this product."

The major roadsand highways are generally well marked from city to city. Once yougo into the cities or looking for specific address this is the way to go.I would never travel without a GPS. The maps were about as accurate asthe US maps and POI was good. The real joy is not to worry about lookingfor street names or where to turn. Our only issue was in the city with narrow streets and loss of signal, but this happens in anywhere. Cost vs. peace of mind -- It's not cheap driving in Europe.

The help files are a great place to start, and unlike some of the higher end programs, there are a ton of user's groups and easy-to-understand tutorials on the interenet for PSP, which is just one more thing this program has going for it.

12514,1,"GREAT OS!! The best improvement since Win98!! I had NO problems in the upgrade. I have had NO problems with performance!! Most important...I have had NO, I repeat NO system hangs or crashes since installing this OS.I installed XP about 2 months after building my first computer. Getting all the drivers installed with WinME was hella time-consuming. I expected the same problems when I upgraded to XP...even worse from all the negative comments I have heard.It was shockingly easy. I formatted the HD just to get a brand spanking new system, and XP automatically installed all the drivers for everything. With ME I had to install the sound card, video card, CDR/RW, LAN card, Printer, Smart/Flash Reader, Web-cam, and scanner with either floppys or CDs. With XP, the process was over in only a few minutes.I spent an hour in disbelief making sure that everything was OK, and it was.On top of that, XP has great support for those of us who need to type in Japanese, but still need an English OS. It is a little tricky, but is part of the standard system.I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 for 2 reasons. 1) Some compatability problems with some older games I have (Magic: the Gathering and Chessmaster 5000). Those games (and I'm sure lots of others) will not work on XP.2) Although it has a great IME for typing Japanese, it is incompatable with most software written for a Japanese OS. Some things will install, but you can't read a lot of what is onl the screen.Final comments: I love it. I highly recommend it."

It was great for teaching me the basics. I got straight A's in German 1; I never took German 2 because I graduated. Wish I had though. In this software, after you learn the basics you are thrown into a tough area. This is what blocked me. It was too much of a jump. Also, the internet references and downloads are no longer active. It never worked for me back in 1999/2000 anyway. The company no longer makes German language products and has changed its address. If you just want a good cheap introductory (with a nice book on grammar), then go ahead and buy this. If you want an up to date program with support and a community, buy a new one. I still use this application for reading and listening."
14930,1,"Maximum PC was not kidding when they called Beyond TV 3 ""Better than Tivo!"" I have been running this software on a computer I built with rather average specs for about 2 years. I use is as a DVR and a DVR only. There is no mouse or keyboard, just a TV connected with s-video and another of snapstreams products, the firefly remote. People are always impressed with it when they see it, it's very stable and never crashes. the recording quality looks much better than that of TiVo and the features are, in most cases, far superior. I recoment the product A++!!!"

19313,2,"I am beyond frustrated and confused about this educational software. I simply wanted to purchase this 4-disc software set at my local 'Target', but then saw the 'broadband connection required' red small print on the box. I did not purchase the product because I had read several other scathing online reviews that claim certain children's software products require unstated additional cost via an online membership registration process! Why do these companies make it so difficult to simply purchase a suite of educational software products that reside on one's hard drive/PC, which can be used over and over and over again??!! I wish they would make it more clear on the box as to whether you are: A) getting the full software suite and product without going online. B) just going online to just register the product without additional cost. C) not getting any, or the full product unless you go online and pay extra for a membership, etc. WHICH ONE IS IT 'JumpStart'???!!! Keep in mind that most software is NOT returnable, so I did not have the realistic option of buying it, trying it, then returning it if it required a net connection and additional money to play! 'JumpStart' lost my business, and i'm sure many others as well.Update: My wife decided to take a chance and buy this software. It truly is inferior in so many ways. The 3D disc does not allow kids access to most doors and other areas! It is an exercise in frustration to watch your child try and access the many learning and game areas, only to be denied access! Ridiculous! And the other discs have low quality graphics that aren't even full screen, that seem they are from the early 1990's! It is hard to believe that this company is selling misleading and sub-par product at major retailers!"
20786,0,"As a freelance web designer/graphic artist I live in a perpetual state of stock photography desperation. I bought this BizArt package in the hopes that it would give me at least a starting point of business photography into which I could reach for those jobs that just don't warrant getting the expensive stuff from Getty or Corbis.On one hand I love this set, on the other I don't. I confess I was hoping for more full-frame photos, even though I know Hemera is mostly known for its &quot;photo objects&quot;. There are some, but not always enough of the type I've wanted. My other complaint is a lack of diversity. Most of the group shots of people are standard caucasian yuppy types. As someone who prefers to represent more diverse racial makeups in my designs, this was very limiting and disappointing. I have frequently had to resort to taking a person of another nationality out of one group and try to insert them into another - not a time-saver.However I do use the clip photos provided here often as a good basis for other pieces. Not a set you want to rely on solely as your source of business photos, but a good starter for the price and a lot better than many cheaper sets I've seen around."
69932,1,"i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because its a little hard for a young 6 year old, you need to be very fast to complete some of the activities like catch the numbers, and the stream part is too difficult to control.its a good game for older children.graphics are nice, and the music is catchy - good concept"
51020,1,"I got to say that I was pretty skeptical when I purchased this. I work for a court reporting company that widely uses WordPerfect 5.1. Anyone will tell you that WordPerfect 5.1 was the best, but its beginning to get really hard to run it just right in the latest operating systems. What caught my attention about WordPerfect 11 was the Classic 5.1 Environment. With everyone working at my company on 5.1 It may be the way to go to get everyone up-to-date. Corel should have done this along time ago! My first few minutes playing around with it and reading the manual to get it into classic mode it was nice. The product seems to be pretty solid, unlike past WordPerfect Windows releases. I didn't do anything real in-depth: did some typing, printing and opening up some older documents save some new ones and see how they were cross compatible. Everything has worked great for me so far. This may be just what my company needs."
66459,0,I thought that I would get more for my money. You still need to buy additional programs to get everything out of this base program. They should have bundled the WHOLE set of programs and then charge you once. But then it might look to expensive for what you actually get. Not worth it!

88894,1,"In much the same way that the various Star Trek series are always hampered by Star Trek characters being just a little to moral V: characters are just a little to perfect. For exampleThey can think their way out of any situation in 5 minutes whereas most of the Visitors with the exception of Diana, Lydia and Charles couldn't reason their way out of a wet paper bag without instructions and a map.This series was a victim of both its time (this being the 80s we had to have a villain of the week) and of the so called ""relaunch"" after Michel Ironside left the series.Before Ironside left not only did you have the updates from the Freedom Network with Michel K. Smith (which were just cool) but you also had the concept of Los Angles being an ""Open City"" and great characters like Nathan Bates and Mr. Chang a very fascinating concept but it was pulled off in such a way that it didn't last very long.The episode ""The Wildcats"" marks the big downturn not only is the series up the river without a paddle or a plot but the Visitors have suddenly gotten extremely inaccurate in their marksmanship.The series stagers on in this way and when it finally starts to pull itself out of the slump in the last episode the series is canceled.Overall-If you find V: the series to be lackluster but you loved the miniseries as I did check out the V: books produced from 1985-1988 that are a lot more in depth then the series ever was you can still find a good supply of them in any decently stocked second hand book store."

58325,1,This is absolutely my favorite ND game. I have about 15 of them. We are utter mac people but we keep our last windows for the purpose only of playing ND games. This is my favorite game because of the story line and the endless amounts of clues ( which does get a tid bit tedious but always more fun). The setting at the school is so intricate with so many possible clues that it makes you actually think. I am a die hard ND book and computer game fan (I've read too many to count :) ) and this game is absolutely fabulous.
40569,0,"While the software has much to be commended for, it is disappointment on two fronts 1) support on investments in the fastest developing countries like India and China where MSN does have a major presence and 2) does not include insurance as an asset as such, only in their lifetime planning section.Both these factors do not let you accurately track your investments, savings or retirement planning accurately.Otherwise, it is a great software given the depth of MSN's online involvement."

26188,1,"First off, I have been using XP since the day it was released. I have used Windows 3.1 up to Server 2003 and as much bad mouthing as Microsoft gets, they have come a long way. Yes, Windows XP has some security issues, the software is bloated, and it isn't without it's problems, but it is very stable and easy to use (compared to previous versions). Is Linux better? Yes and No. For the average home user, Linux is not a wise choice. I love Linux, but would I recommend my Mom use it? No. she'd be lost. That said I think that if you apply ALL security patches, install a good anti-virus and use the built in firewall (at the very least) you'll be reasonably safe. If you are installing over a current operating system, do yourself a favor and backup your data, wipe off your hard drive and do a clean install of Windows XP. You'll avoid more problems that way. Aside from Server 2003, this is the best Microsoft OS yet. Maybe that isn't saying a whole lot, but considering the alternatives this the OS to get for the average PC user."
6345,0,"I bought this software to install on my new MacBook with OS 10.7 Lion. I had been using it on my old Powerbook running OS 10.3.9 and it worked very well for what I needed it for. I wanted this old version because Microsoft has taken the Page Break Preview feature out of the newer versions of Excel and I use that a lot and wanted to have it.Found out the hard way though, that Office for Mac 2004 does NOT work for any Intel based computers, only the Mac Power PCs. Anyone who is trying to use this on a newer Mac will find that the programs are not able to run.It's just fine on the Power PCs. A few minor bugs here and there, but then again, it is a Microsoft product...**EDITI believe I was mistaken about this product not working on Intel machines. Apparently, this software will work on any Intel machine that is equipped with Rosetta Stone. This feature was discontinued on OS 10.7, which is why is wouldn't run on my new computer. Any Intel-Mac running an earlier version of OS X should be fine with Rosetta Stone."
87471,1,"Although I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com (...), I absolutely love it. The GPS locator provided is amazing and better than I thought it was. It is not one of those GPS that updates your position every 20 seconds or something, but when I zoomed in I could see my current location constantly moving on the map (so it is updating every second)...I have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the GPS provided to them isn't even this good. I recommend this software and GPS to anyone."

85586,0,"I like Final Cut Pro, I like Motion, and I like LiveType. But it is as if they were written by 3 different companies who didn't expect them to work together. And sadly, this version is no different. Still if you are doing editing on Apple hardware Final Cut Studio 2 is your best choice.This program is for the every-day editor/user, not for casual users as the learning curve is way out there. Add to that the inconsistencies between the ""Studio"" products and you have more learning curve issues. Sadly, the video editor which bares the studio name Final Cut Pro, is the one tool that could have used a contemporary face lift and yet it had only what I would call ""point release"" quality updates. Whereas Motion (which was the most user-friend and modern interface) got huge new features that are outstanding.It seems to ne that Final Cut may be at the end of what software engineers can do with the Final Cut Pro editor itself without a complete rewrite from the grown up. But then they stand the chance of alienating their current legacy users; and as we've seen with iMovie 2008, Apple isn't too smart when it comes to cleverly updating video editing workflows.Unfortunately, I still have to resort to using iMovie from time to time to capture video since it always captures anything from any camera, and then import it into Final Cut Pro. Whereas Final Cut Pro often imports without a problem 60 to 80 percent of the time. The other times you can spend an entire day trying to select the right ""Easy Setup"" to capture video. Why or why Apple does it not capture as easily as iMovie ('06)?Is it worth an upgrade fee? Well sure if you're in the business it isn't that much of an expense. If you're counting your pennies, however (if you only do wedding videos for example and don't need the latest and greatest) you are really not missing anything by staying with the previous version. If you are considering this vs Adobe, well I'd go with Final Cut Studio and get a copy of Adobe After Effects (the CS3 version is very cool) and you'll have the best tools available for the Apple platform."
32492,1,"I was truely amazed by this film. I saw it once alone, once with my wife and once with my brother in-law and it was just as awesome each time. To see the space station and astronauts in 3D was a real treat but instead of just being enthralled with all of the technology, the thought I kept revisiting and conveying to my movie guests was ""My God, Look at earth!"" I mean at one point you're looking down a long structure towards earth and seeing 3D cloud formations and the next you're experiencing the space shuttle lifting off and performing a roll (Really cool)and seeing a beach get really small. To sum up, I've always wondered what earth looks like to astronauts from space and thanks to IMAX and NASA, now I know in a very big way."

I know what your saying...that I should just turn off my speakers.

Don't buy this game unless you're buying it for someone under 8 years old."
57900,1,"I have been a loyal Turbotax user for years and decided to tryout TaxCut this year. I was EXTREMELY unhappy after last year's fiasco where Intuit installed Spyware without users knowledge in order to cutdown on copyright infringement of their product. Unfortunately, they ticked off the loyal users like myself. I believe they have lost/will lose more sales based on that fiasco than they could've possibly saved by catching a few people trying to copyright infringe!Anyway, I was impressed with TaxCut especially for the price. I paid about 40% less for TaxCut Deluxe & TaxCut State than I would have paid for Turbotax Deluxe & Turbotax State.For the most part, the programs are very similar. TaxCut does the usual interview process just like Turbotax and it makes it very easy to work with. Where TaxCut needs a bit more polish is in the fine details. Missing was the ability to save your tax returns into Adobe Acrobat format. I love that feature in Turbotax and really missed it.In addition, I had a little trouble with form 4767 because I claim deductions for a home office and sold my house/moved this year. It worked out after some reading of the help file and IRS.gov site, but it could've been more intuitive.Other than those couple of items, I was very happy with the program(s). I ran my return through Turbotax's website (without purchasing or filing it) and the numbers came out the same so I am satisfied with the accuracy of the software as well. Overall I'm glad I switched to TaxCut this year. I doubt I'll look at Turbotax in the future."
66047,1,"I was expecting to like this program, not love it--and love it I do. I do workouts with it 6 times a week, and I'm on my 80th since September, when I bought it. I had hoped it would fill in with my home gym workouts and provide variety, but it's now my mainstay. I run it on a Dell XP Professional machine with no problems.After profile setup, you're asked to do a 20-30 minute evaluation workout the first and every tenth workout to test cardio fitness, upper body, core, lower body, and flexibility you also are asked your weight. No, it's not exhaustive, but it's certainly good enough to go on with. Then the virtual trainer, Maya, makes a recommendation for a plan. You make your committment for days and durations, and on you go. (I'm a vegetarian, and on WeightWatchers, so I do my own menus--no comments about that part.)There's always a few minutes of warm up, about 15 to 20 minutes of cardio (for my plan, anyhow), and then onto the focus of the day. I was in OK but not great shape when I started, and I can really see the difference in musculature and endurance after this many weeks. I'm pretty pleased. I don't get bored, as the exercises routines are never *exactly* the same from day to day or week to week. We rotate through Cardio, Upper Body, Core, Lower Body, and Flexibility workouts. The ""Weight Loss"" workout turns out to be another Cardio class. You need about 4 paces square to work in, and a cushioned mat for floor work.The routines are adjusted for what equipment you have as well as how long you want to go. Durations are in 15 minute increments up to an hour. The equipment is minimal: your choice of any or all of cardio monitor, step-bench, balance ball, and hand weights. I don't have a step bench, but I may get one just for curiosity's sake (when I can afford one). The cardio monitor was a nice-to-have, too, though you can tell if you're at your 80% range by a certain natural rhythm to your breathing (in-breath for two steps, out-breath for two steps). You can get most anything you'd need from Target or by mail from Amazon. Two 3-pound weights are good starters for most purposes--I'm moving them pretty fast to use much heavier weights.Maya does check in with you thoughout the program to see how you're doing, and adjusts the difficulty appropriately. I'd say they pretty much got that right, and I do appreciate it. If I start off saying I'm not feeling great, the workout is easier. If I'm feeling peppy, she's that much harder.Not hard enough? Bounce more and use more weights. I have knees that hurt, so I do a low-impact version of the exercises when I have to, and that works fine, too. You have to use some judgement on your own to make it work for you, same as with any class or method.I have to say that I like the music pretty well, too. I think they mixed their own and did a good job of it. You can adjust the relative voice/music levels, too. Actually, if you were completely deaf but could see the screen, you could still have a good workout with this. The exercise you're on scrolls across the bottom of the screen, and shows what's coming up, too.I haven't done much with the yoga (Meditation Garden) section, but I'm not much into Hatha Yoga anyway. It's fairly fast-moving for my tastes, but that's not a bad thing. You may have to use the ""tutorial"" button to get the mannikin model to show you how to do things a time or two.Answering some of the negatives in other reviews: The ""pixelation"", or jaggies, is because Maya is placed on her background like a sprite with no anti-aliasing. Who cares? It's good enough visually for its purpose, and a few years old at that. It's not all that noticeable from across a room, anyhow. Not enough variety in exercises?--well, there's only so many variations to jogging, kicking, stepping, and arm-flapping that you can do. Have a favorite you want to substitute during a class for something Maya's doing? Go ahead. Who'll know but you? If you work this program, it'll work for you.Now, bad customer service is a sad thing, I have to agree. The company that made this isn't really in business any more, so they're not helpful, I hear, and more's the pity. I would have adored an expansion. But that's a business problem, not a design problem. And I'm not really surprised that some PCs have problems with the program--that's pretty much the story with PC games anyhow. I guess I didn't expect perfection, (being a programming/design geek myself) so I'm very happy with it overall. This has been a *lot* of bang for $30!"
47412,1,"It's a wonderful CD Rom! I love giving myself new looks without taking the risks. It's so funny to see the creative hairstyles, like Frankenstein or a mohawk. It's perfect for if you want a certain haircut because you can just print out the one you want!"
64678,1,"I'm not sure what age this is actually recommended for, but it's been fun and challenging for a 7 yr old, fun (but not completeable without help) for a 5 yr old, and inexpensive entertainment for a 2.5 yr old (who loves some of the mini games). I think one of the best features is that it changes whenever you start a *new* game. You can save the old ones and pick up where you left off, but if you start a new game, your challenges will change, as will some of the characters you meet. Since the basic plot is Pajama Sam wandering around the land of darkness looking for his Pajama Man lunchbox, mask, and flashlight so that he can confront darkness, the general map stays the same, but the specifics vary. Sometimes a carrot freedom fighter has the mask and you have to help liberate his fellow carrots before he'll give it back to you. And sometimes you have to find paddles for your boat, or cogs for a gear -- you get the idea. The downside for a parent is that you don't automatically know where everything is and how to get it, even if you've played it through yourself. The upside in the game is that you will occasionally be given hints like, ""if only I had something that floated"". And some of the mini-games are fun -- all the kids love mixing up potions in the laboratory.On the whole, this game is light hearted with a good sense of humor and fairly entertaining. The problems aren't *usually* very difficult, though I have run across a few that are fairly involved and may require parental hints for younger kids. I just wish it ran native on OS X, istead of requiring 9. Not a big thing, just a little annoying."

I learned how to say 'milk' in Gujarati, but I wouldn't know how to form a sentence about milk. I would recommend this only for people who just want to impress someone with a few phrases or words, but it wont give you any understanding of how the language works. This cd-rom was because I work for a family who speaks Gujarati, and wanted to speak a little for them, but if you're looking to do more, it isn't for you."

Each time they come in, one of them says, ""What a cool program!"" before going back to the computer. My 12 year old, who is grounded at the moment, hasn't even complained about being limited to ""smart games"" on the computer because this is one of the programs he's allowed to use. They're all Astronomy enthusiasts anyway - the sort who will set the alarm for 3am to go out and see a comet. I couldn't say if the software would only appeal to that type. But I wish you could see these guys! They're competing with each other to see if they can come up with yet another fact or software functionality that will out-do what the others have found. They're already talking about getting the advanced version of the program - but this one will take them quite a ways, so there isn't any hurry. I just wish I could rate it more than five stars!"

Learn Czech program much better than the Rosetta Stone French program I have (and I spent A LOT more on the latter). I find the Rosetta Stone programs more visually appealing, but I've learned a lot more with Talk Now!.Note: Czech words and phrases are vocalized by both a man and woman. To my ear, their pronounciations are different. I am not sure if these speakers come from different regions or what, but as a stickler for pronounciation, I was a little unsure whether to follow the pronounciation of the man or the woman."
82574,0,"On one hand, the questions are HARD. Harder than the WWTBAM 2nd edition. And they are varied in breadth and scope. On the other hand, the game engine tends to repeat questions much more quickly than WWTBAM2. Plus some of the musical cues (the ones which play before a question is displayed, to be precise) are missing. However, for the entertainment value, it's a pretty good buy. Not great, not a million-dollar-level, but if you love the TV show... it's not bad."
70715,1,I replaced Norton Internet Security Suite with this product. What drew me was the automatic behind-the-scenes defrag and backup capability. I've found that it is much less intrusive than NISS was. It does its Live Update silently in the background and gives a gentle indication if a reboot is needed rather than insisting on it. You can still get the adware and antispam feature as a free add-on pack. I did (and highly recommend) uninstall NISS before putting this on.
20408,0,"Hi,I bought this software because I am taking a trip to England soon.The software is ok, but it could be better, I am not a fan of the zoom. You have to go up to a zoom bar to adjust. I also own Delorme Street Atlas and I fing that software much easier to use from a functionality standpoint. To Zoom in the Delorme you drag a box, or stairstep out. (I know that isn't clear, but once you do it it's easy)However the price on the Autoroute is what sold me. I will be using it for about one week, and will probably never use it again. The fact it sets up with a GPS is very cool, I am a fan of using a laptop as a GPS device, I will never get a pocket size one."

13553,2,"This game is way too frustrating for any age group. I played it with my 6-year old nephew and 10-year-old niece, and none of us can use the keyboard well enough to succeed.The game works like a Super Mario Brothers arcade of ladders and roadblocks. The problem is that the keyboard commands do not respond well and a mouse is not supported. If you don't hit the spacebar-cursor key combination just right, you fall when trying to jump, and each time you fall, you must redo a very long sequence of moves to get back to where you left off. This becomes boring and extremely frustrating--leaving the 6-year-old near tears, the 10-year-old banging keys, and me wondering how this game ever made it past the testing stage.THQ, the manufacturer, makes a lot of games for all the popular video game machines. Perhaps with a video game controller, this game can play well, but it does not translate to a computer keyboard."

I can't do it with my eyes anymore, and feel like I don't get it right and also have desktop and laptop to synchronize. The product worked great, good to see good color. The only problem, is it is automatically set for 14 days to be recalibrated which I think is too soon, and then the reminder seems to pop on after a few days. There may be a way to set it but it does seem to keep color, just can't do the before and after compare.I researched all the options and did not want to have to go with the $200-$300 and up calibrator and think this one seems to do the job.

One new feature that stands out is the new MULTI-MAX 3-BAND COMPRESSOR. This is great for &quot;punching up&quot; dull sounding recordings. All in all, a very worth while product that is very easy to use. Great software for the price - get it!"
75360,0,I got a nice package deal on Fritz 9 and Chessmaster 10th Edition. My last copy of Fritz was Fritz 7. I really don't see much difference between the two. If you already have an earlier edition of Fritz save your money or buy Chessmaster instead. There was not much bang for the buck here.
71485,0,"Well, what can you say... live and learn I suppose. Bottom-line, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is a big disappointment for me.I recently purchases Elements 3.0 and read the upgrade benefits in Elements 4.0 on the Adobe website. I thought, great 16-bit image support, facial color restoration, improved this improved that.At the end of the day, I uninstalled Elements 4.0 and went back to 3.0Why? I take a lot of photos and keep them in the highest resolution format I can. I generally use TIFF format. I like to convert them into JPG format for distribution on CD/DVD or on the web.In Photoshop Elements 3.0 there was a file browser and I could easily select 2 or more photos and edit them or convert them. This file browser is gone in 4.0 and while it was poorly designed in 3.0 it worked once you figured out its annoyances.But the 4.0 product in practice doesn't seem to handle 16-bit files any differently than the 3.0 version. What's more, it tends to blow up on my system when converting to JPG. In fact some of the very same files I converted with 3.0 to JPG are causing 4.0 to blow up.I would speculate that PhotoShop Elements 4.0, which is only available under Windows for now, will be thoroughly tested by the time the Mac OS X version comes out later this year. Too bad Windows users have to be the beta testers and funding providers for Adobe's PhotoShop Elements 4.0If you already own PhotoShop Elements 2.0 or 3.0 don't bother with this upgrade. If you own nether, I would recommend Microsoft Digital Image 2006 Suite. It is easier to use and ironically seems to work better."
74987,1,"BACKGROUNDUsing Rosetta Stone French (v.3) on a Mac iBook G4 (10.3.9). Using home school addition. Have used it for last 6 weeks.SUMMARYIn spite of the cost, the awkward port from Windows and difficult network set up, it's still best of class for learning a foreign language.REVIEWPowerful, detailed and complicated: those are the adjectives I would use to describe this program. If you want to learn the language, then this program systemically teaches it to you. It keeps record of your progress, gives tests and records your grades. It treats you as if you are a student in a classroom. Additional workbook, study guide and included microphone headset supplement the visual and audio CD disk. But having said all this, there are some things I wish as a Mac user that I would have known.The set-up of the program is SO non-intuitive and non-mac like. This includes installation of the application and its MANY helper files needed to run in the background with the main program disk. In my former life, I was an Apple System engineer, so I am no stranger to the Mac and networks setups. But even this installation caused me to eventually have to call Rosetta's technical support for instruction. This is partially due to my complicated home network set up (I've got multiple Macs with multiple (non-Mac) Routers that work as Access Points and bridges), and partially because of the complexity of installation of the program itself. This is definitely NOT a ""drag-and-drop"", or ""double click to un- compress"" or even ""double click and follow the step by step instruction"" type of experience. It is ""multi-step, enter by hand, enter in data and information"" type of installation process.That is what is most disappointing to me. This is a BAD PORT of a PC program. They did nothing to make the program conform to Apple program standards. This means there are many helper files (20 something??!!!) in various folders. There is a network component that HAS TO run in the background for the main language program to run. This means you have to always first launch this secondary program (or leaving it running all the time). If you run on a network (like I do), you have to assign the computer's IP address that the program is running on (can't use the default, non-network IP given by the setup program). If your computer ever is assigned a different IP address locally by your router (power goes out, etc), then you will have to make some changes or this network helper file will not launch, and therefore, the language program will not either.Getting to the place to even begin to first use the program is a tedious and complicated process. Another helper program that keeps track of the students progress must also first be set up. The ""teacher's"" name, access settings, the ""student's"" name(s) and their access privileges must first be established. ALL THIS IS DONE AWKWARDLY AND IN AN IBM 90'S INTERFACE. Constant referring to the user guide is necessary. There is no way some one could figure out what to do by only looking at the screens.And this is the main criticism of the program, this clunky interface, non-intuitive layout of material is the same throughout the entire presentation of the language program. The program's strengh--the detailed comprehensive, multi-media presentation of material--is also it's greatest weakness. It's hard to follow where you are, where to go, what stage you are in, how much further you have to go on any given unit, lesson or session. The implementation of more than one user account and switching between the two is counter intuitive as well.My 16 year old daughter, is now working her way through the program and has used it enough now to understand how to advance though it. But it was a slow start. She is enjoying the program and is learning the language of her love, and I have no doubt this program is a great help, I just wish more effort and forethought was given to making it more elegant in its presentation. Basically this looks to me like a 90's program in desperate need of a face lift. While calling the toll-free tech support and talking with a couple of different individuals, you quickly come to understand these people don't fully understand the Mac. The first individual had to pass me on once he discovered my Mac issues. The second was very polite and patient and we finally got my set up to work. But it wasn't easy for them since I was on a Mac. And I bet if you call you will get the same two people, They are, after all, not a help desk, but a language learning software company.CONCLUSIONOK, so that's it. I hope this review was helpful. I've tried to share my experience for other Mac users so they know more of what to expect before they buy the program. A program that has (from my research) no other comparison as far as best in class for learning a foreign language, but a program that--in it's implementation and presentation as far as on Macintosh computers is concerned--leaves a lot to me desired.Tom"

Not only the speech technology is very efficient but the software also has a lot of functionalities to drive your computer by using speech.When you buy the software don't get confused with Dragon 5.0 which is the old version and which has nothing to do with the capabilities of Dragon 6.0. Dragon 6 is also way better that IBM Via Voice that I tried at a friend's place. Anyway, Scansoft the maker of Dragon 6.0 is the leading speech software company so you can't be wrong. One thing: the training of the software is very quick and easy."
75891,1,"I had a problem in that I needed to complete a presentation in flash with characters doing athletic movements within a few days. I had previously used Poser3 about 6 years ago and decided to pick up poser 7 (for a very good price from Amazon directly as it happened - about the same as some companies were selling the upgrade for!). Within a couple of days I had the software delivered and characters exported in flash, sitting, running and jumping in my presentation. I would go as far as to say this is (still) the most intuitive interface I have ever used. If you want something to happen you just know how to do it. I know Poser 7 is much more advanced than before with the ability to make characters lip synch and to create detailed faces; you can even skin your own face on to a character, but you can get excellent results with just the basics. It also has a massive library of preset poses and even objects now which was great. The final outcome, I had created a top notch presentation within days. My client was thrilled.David Kenyon[...]"

13828,1,"I have bought both Encarta and Britannica for years (EB in printed edition too: 32 volumes, 32.000 sheets). This is my opinion in brief: Encarta is excellent in all aspects, but Britannica's authoritative text (sometimes outdated) makes interesting to buy both.&iquest;DVD or CD? Both editions are actually the same. You can copy them in your hard disk.TEXT: Britannica is a superb encyclopedia in text (not in visual aid) since 1768 (you know: an article by Einstein and so on...). Text in electronic version differs from printed encyclopedia (very large articles have been shortened). Britannica claims that it has more items than Encarta, but this is a joke: articles like ""Mexico"" are only one (with a lot of subdivisions) in Encarta, while in Britannica subdivisions are unconnected, and you must ""jump"" from one subdivision to another, which is slow and very annoying, especially if you want to copy it in ""WORD"". Very often, the text is not updated.In the other hand, Encarta's text is not bad at all. Most articles have the name of their contributors (professions, works...): They are not John Doe. You can find large fragments of literary works, literature guides, a lot of sidebars and thousands of quotations. ""Encarta Africana"" is included. The Pop-Up (double clicking a word) Dictionary and Thesaurus has sound for correct pronunciation (by the way, it can read aloud, with a robotic and ugly voice, a whole article). The ""Translation Dictionaries"" to Spanish, French, German and Italian must be improved, because they are minimal. It gives you a lot of ""Internet links"", even if you are not connected. With Britannica you must be ""on-line"" and it searches in an EB Web page.In theory you can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year quarterly (4 times), but this does not work: You can not find new files. Encarta can be updated free EVERY WEEK with new articles and additions or corrections to the old ones (till October 2004). With Encarta updating really works. Technically, is amazing to see the changes in old items.ATLAS Britannica has not a real atlas; only a worlds map whose maximum detail is the States of USA. Statistics are very poor. Encarta's Atlas is like another encyclopedia, with a great detail (1 cm/ 4 km all over the world) and 20 types of atlas presentations (statistical ones can be counted by dozens). If you look a geographical article (city, river...) you can see in a corner where it is placed and, with only a click, open the atlas. In articles of cities, if you are on-line, you can see in another corner the weather of this place in that moment. If it is a USA place, you can read the latest news.MULTIMEDIA: They say that ""serious"" or ""adult"" readers do not care about ""pictures""; that multimedia is only for kids. I do not agree, because I think that, sometimes, ""A picture is worth a thousand words"". Works of art, anatomy, historical maps, diagrams ... Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of photos, paintings, drawings, charts & tables, animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, 2-D and 3-D virtual tours, 360-degrees views, timeline, games... It is not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text and multimedia are fully integrated. Britannica is not really multimedia. It has photos and videos, but they make the program slow and sluggish. They should edit an alternative version with only text, as they did with the first edition in 1995. It worked fast and easy in old computers.INTERFACE AND PERFORMANCE: This is the worst side of Britannica. With Encarta you only have to type a word or the beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contain it. If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you automatically alternative spellings. Even if you write the name of a small village lost in any country, you see it in the atlas. If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft WORD is perfect. It has additional ways to find content, including subject or multimedia browsing, ""related articles"" and the standard A-Z method. The ""Research Organizer"" is very helpful too. Encarta's TEXT FONT is very clear (Britannica's...) and you can choose 3 sizes.Navigating with Britannica is different. 2004 edition is better than 2003 one, but still it is disappointing. I will only give you an example: if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with similar spellings (unless you open a window and fight with it). As I said before, the program's performance speed is very slow and sluggish, and it must be dramatically improved. To go ""back and forward"" you do not find any icon and you need to open a ""menu"".... One ""pro"" for Britannica: they say it works with Macintosh.I repeat my modest piece of advice: Encarta is excellent in all aspects, but Britannica's authoritative text (sometimes outdated) make interesting to buy both."
56808,1,"The product is by no means perfect, and the customer service is just aweful. BUT the product works. You speak and it writes for you. I am a lawyer and I have to write plenty everyday. This product has truly made my life easier. I wish it was better. It's not 100% accurate, but it still takes time off my hands. I've tried others, like the mac version, and this one is superior.But be warned, if you have any issues with the installation or learning how to use it, you will have to figure it out by yourself. I'm not much of a computer connausseur but fortunately someone close is. It turns out I had to change my sound card. Had I not someone computer savvy close by I would have never made it work.All in all, I would buy it again. I just haven't found anything better out there. So in comparison to what's out there it's a 5, but the fact that the costumer service is practically non existent is what makes me give them this rating. I can understand not having perfected the product. But if you're charging people for it, then you should give support, and great support at that."
77125,1,"First thing's first. Garmin gets a big award for ease of use with this. I just stuck the Micro-SD Card into my Garmin Nuvi and it was ready to go. When I landed in Brazil it immediately recognized where I was. AWESOME.We visited a number of places on our trip, including Rio, Salvador and some areas way off the grid (Lencois in the Chapada Diamantina). I have to say, the further you get out of the big cities, the less accurate this get. For instance, if I had truly followed the directions to Lencois (a tiny town 6 hours inland from Salvador), I would not have made it. But it was able to keep me going on the major roads until I encountered signs alerting me to the correct turnoff.If you're trying to get into Pelourinho in Salvador, this unit is a little bit of a disaster because it's surrounded by above-ground highways but the unit assumes everything is on the same level. The beauty of the GPS units is if you keep driving it keeps recalculating and you eventually get where you want to go. The description only promised detailed maps in Rio, Belo and Sao Paulo, so I couldn't fault it too much.Directions in Rio were pretty flawless as promised. I have always been incredibly stressed out driving in Rio since the roads are incredible confusing. This unit helped take 90% of the stress away (Rio drivers kept it 10% stressful!). I will never drive in Rio without it again. It gave us a lot of confidence to explore new areas of Rio we've always been afraid to visit simply because we were worried about getting there. This paid for itself over and over again on our trip!"
73354,1,"The Rosetta Stone software can be very useful to the learning and study of arabic as long as you use it in conjuction with other materials. Rosetta Stone Arabic teaches Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), which is a more academic and universal form of arabic as it is based on the written language. This differs from colloquial dialects which are rarely written and can differ greatly n different regions. The materials I used, and in fact are still using, are the Rosetta Stone software along with The Arabic Alphabet, by Nicholas Awde and Arabic for Dummies, by Amine Bouchentouf. These materials cover all the general subjects required for the learning of MSA. The Arabic Alphabet covers the alphabet and does an excellent job and should be covered before the use of the Rosetta Stone software. The Rosetta Stone software itself is essential to the building up of a vocabulary. It starts with basic nouns and then building on them and then forming sentences by adding verbs and adjectives.Through this method you begin to understand the structure and grammar of the language, however without further instruction it can be hard to define exactly what the grammatical structure is. The software, however, is weak on the fact that it does not teach the alphabet, it only shows it in conjuction with the media which it is teaching through. It also does not cover conversational abilities. You may be able to say, ""The small boy kicked a black and white ball inside a large house and broke a window"", but you won't be able to say ""Hello, my name is x"". Luckily the other two materials cover these apects. Arabic for Dummies provides an excellent introduction to MSA along with having a simple yet informative coverage of arabic grammar. Arabic for Dummies also supplies the converasational aspect as it includes 17 chapters covering most everyday situations. However this book avoids using the arabic alphabet although it gives a brief introduction of it. Because of this I recommend that this book come first as it provides a solid introduction and shows you exactly what your getting into."

57170,1,"I bought my Garmin E Trex Vista on the recommendation of the salesman, telling me that I can &quot;hook it up to my computer, and download maps&quot;. Even the manual that came with the GPS gave a quick blurb about adding their MapSource software to add &quot;detailed map data&quot; to the very limited map that's built-into the unit. So I investigated both the Topo maps, and Recreational maps at the Garmin website, and both seemed quite a bit more detailed, even though my favorite lake looked only like a rough representation, with only one hill. Then I checked out Map Tech, and the detail was ten-fold! It showed every little slope, and accurately depicted every inch of the shoreline, so I bought it. The only glitch I noticed, was that the cursor on the map is supposed to show elevation, but if you follow one line thats supposedly following a contour, it's plus or minus 15 feet as you scroll, and when I pointed at the lake, then at a thirty foot hill, it showed the same elevation between the two, where the field right next to it accurately showed every foot difference of elevation But when I tried downloading the maps into my Garmin Vista, I found the only thing you can transfer back and forth between the GPS and computer were waypoints, tracks, and routes. So all I could download were little dots on that screen, which shows my lake as a blank field. Garmin Website tells me the only GPS units that accept map upgrades, (Mapsource only), are the GPS12 Map, GPS III+, E-Map, GPS Map 295, and the Street Pilot. I guess all I can do with the MapTech is print the maps to carry to the field, lug my lap-top with me on a hike, or buy a handheld, but someone else wrote that his Compaq works,but not Palm? All I wanted was a small GPS, which I could take on a hike, and have it show me very detailed maps, so I could find the best routes, and I'd never have to worry about getting lost. This one only shows main roads, how to get back to your starting point, and little lines to follow if I pre determine a route at home."

Meanwhile in the real world I've been 12000 miles in my RV with it (and also ST 2006 which had the Pharos 360 receiver) and at best it is intermittent. I bought the 2007 edition because it was advertised to have improved reception with the Pharos 500 receiver. Recently on the stretch of I-10 between San Antonio and El Paso, where there was a clear blue sky and no trees or hills to block the sky, it lost satellite signal at least a dozen times with the pharos receiver out on the roof. It's an interesting toy but not a real GPS mapping system. I would be so embarrassed if I worked at MS on this product, that I would just tell my friends ""I'm in accounting"". If you depend on GPS, DO NOT buy this product."

5955,0,"I bought TaxCut because of all the bad things said now about turbotax. However, it is buggy. In fed, it never prompts u to enter 1099G forms. This can cost u an audit.In state (NJ), it never prompts you to enter medical deductions. It just silently uses the federal numbers. However, this is wrong. The state numbers are not the same as fed. If u have medical FSA, it cannot itemized on federal, but can be on state. Even worse, on fed, it asks if you have more than 7.5% med expenses, otherwise, don't bother entering. So I didn't enter any med deductions. NJ state is 2%, so I would be able to deduct but taxcut never prompts for it. Just silently puts 0 from fed. Also, it won't e-file if I manually update state med deductions directly in form. Called Tech Support, explained them problems, but they are clueless. Kept telling me to go to hire a tax advisor. :("

I got the &quot;proper&quot; 1 inch space at the top and did not have any other problems with the program. This software, unlike others, will NOT write the screenplay for you. You absolutely need to know the ins and outs of screenwriting because it will not hold your hand through the process. I for one, do not want index cards popping up reminding me of what was written before. That is confusing and I am competent enough to keep up with my own work. This is a great basic program, and you can't beat the price. If you know how to write a screenplay or even if you have read a book on how to write a screenplay, this program is all you need. No frills, no chills, but it gives you the chance, properly formatted, to put your words down."

53374,1,"102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue was basically the first game I bought with my own money. I was young when I bought it, but I don't regret it at all. It's very fun! You can play as Oddball or Domino, and can switch puppies anytime you want in the game. Cruella has put out dozens of ""toys"" in each level which try to attack your puppy, but you destroy them by barking or tumbling at them. There are 100 bones to collect in each level, and if you collect them all you get some bonus or another. Also in each level there are 6 of your puppy brothers and sisters that Cruella has captured that you must release. You also have to defeat Horace, LePelt, and Jasper, and sometimes even Cruella herself. You get help from animal friends, and on the last level, you have a showdown with Cruella. There's also minigames to play. It's not just for 4 year olds; it requires some thinking and problem solving, and it takes practice to defeat the toys without losing a life. Even I, the master at this game still lose lives here and there with certain toys. Also there are a few cool ""glitches"" in the game that really aren't glitches so much as fun things to do, for example, somewhere in the first level, you can make your puppy fly by jumping over a fence in a certain spot. I would recommend this game to anyone 11 and under that finds it interesting, but older people who are young at heart might enjoy it too!"

5322,1,"""The Latin Centered Curriculum: Home Schooler's Guide To A Latin-Centered Classical Education"" was specifically written and designed by Andrew A. Campbell (a practicing homeschooler who holds advanced degrees in Germanic Literature and Languages, with a speciality in Medieval Studies) to enable parents and teachers a ready and 'user friendly' manual for providing children with the basic principles of a Latin and Greek oriented classical education. Beginning with a brief history of the modern classical movement, Campbell goes on to examine the predominate role of Latin in a classical western education and how the various parts of a classical curriculum come together into a coherent whole. Covering Latin, Greek, and Logic, Campbell also addresses English studies, classical studies, Christian and modern studies, mathematics and science. More than offering theories of classical education, Campbell provides commentary and an overview of a practical curriculum that can be readily implemented at home or in the classroom. ""The Latin Centered Curriculum"" is especially appropriate for Christian parents wanting to acquire a substantial understanding of just what is involved with providing their homeschooled child with a classical education. Also very highly recommended from Memoria Press as ideal curriculum materials for the study of Latin and Greek is their ""Famous Men of Rome"" series ($39.95, for grades 3 and up); their ""Famous Men of the Middle Ages"" set ($16.95), the ""D'Aularies' Greek Myths"" series ($45.00, for grades 3 and up); and the comb-bound Horatius at the Bridge Guide"" ($14.95). Homeschooling parents who are considered developing a classical education based curriculum for their children would be well advised to visit the Memoria Press website at[...]for a full listing of all their curriculum materials, supplements and online courses."

After converting my current file, I found so many errors that I immediately contacted Microsoft support. I'm still working with them but have rolled back to Money 2004. In its present form I cannot use Money 2005 at all.Examples: Bills & Deposits - numerous duplicate entries, reflecting reconciled transactions as much as 18 moths old,Portfolio - all stock sales reported as credits to my cash account; I am hundreds of thousands in the red ;-)Portfolio - stock splits create twice as many shares as it shouldDownloaded transactions are reported as credits when my bank has them as debits.I even tried starting from scratch, i.e., using a ""new"" Money file but many of the same errors occurred again.While the new interface is nice but will take some getting used to - in this case, beauty is only skin deep."

15632,1,"This is the worst product I have used for recording and time shifting TV. TV recording is a brand new feature to the Nero suite and it is advertised touting this capability. The average user, however, probably will not be able to figure out how to make it work due to it requiring a 3rd party (xmltv), dos based utility to update the program guide for which Nero doesn't provide any instructions on setting up. Even if successful in this endeavor you then must manually import the program guide that you've downloaded into the Nero suite. As only about a weeks worth of programming content is available at any one time this download and import must be completed frequently. Other poor features of the PVR function include having to 'map' all of your video card's channels one-by-one to the channel guide content you've downloaded, the program guide is poor as well and isn't really useful until you've labeled and mapped all of your channels. I'll be going back to GB-PVR (free) for my DVRI still gave this product good marks as still I consider it to be the gold standard of burning, some of the other items in the suite still appear to be afterthoughts, just be mindful of that when making your purchasing decisions."

57133,0,"* urban elevation data is poor. Don't expect to find the 100ft hill next door on the map, and don't expect to see it on the 3d mode.* I've played with it for a few hours now and it crashed once (on winXP)* There's no way to set a default directory for exporting pictures.. and it won't remember where you last exported to. Annoying.* Fire roads in state parks (Big Basin Redwoods for me) show up BARELY, but are not named. Park trails do not show up.* A lot of window boxes are &quot;modal&quot;.. meaning you can't leave the window open while viewing another window. This means that you can't compare legs of routes side-by-side. You can't compare route profiles. These are unnecessary (AFAIK) limitations in the software and should be considered bugs.* As you might expect, there are occasional inaccuracies in the map, specifically in the urban areas. The maps tend to be older sometimes, which I guess can cause these problems. Don't buy this as a reliable road map.* The CA set consists of like 12 cds. You have to insert like 5 of them and go through InstallShield for each one so that TNav knows you have the region (and haven't pirated it). You still have to insert each of the 12 cds whenever you want to view a different region. I haven't seen an option to cache the map data on hard drive instead of inserting the cds.On the positive side, this program does have really need route/waypoint features. I like being able to freehand draw over a dirt road and then view the elevation profile for the road.. You could do the same for hiking trails (if you know exactly where the trail runs!).. The 3d mode is really neat too, although I think the 3d-glasses are a joke.I can't compare this to other programs because I haven't used any others.. I'm giving this 3 because the current average of 4.5 stars is too high."
69283,0,"I recently purchased this software from Amazon, and I've been experiencing technical problems from the moment it was installed on my computer. I am using the program at work, on my brand new Dell system, and it just won't act right! The print preview function creates error messages, and when I printed my resume the software placed weired lines and boxes on my resume. I've contacted tech support, and they are unsure as to what the problem might be. They've asked me to switch printers, remove the software, and then install the software. We've been going back and forth for about 2 weeks. I've used a previous edition of Resume Maker and I had technical problems with the software, but I assumed it was because my computer was a bit older.As for the content of the software, I do feel that it offers some useful information. You are provided with a resume coach, with tips on the types of resume that may suit you. I'm giving this product 3 stars because of the quality of the software."

90101,0,"I'm a musician with a home studio built around a Windows XP machine, and was looking to add an iBook to take advantage of music programs not written for Windows. I spent some time with this and other machines in an Apple store and concluded that I'll put up with Windows--and buy about 50% more laptop for the same price--rather than being straight-jacketed by this overly designed and clunky user interface. I'm one of those creative types that's not afraid of technology and am really, really demanding of flexibility in the operating system. Windows does this so much better than OS X, at least for my needs. And not having access to two buttons is the final killer. Whether on the net, in Photoshop, or in Reason, I don't want to have to hit control to bring up a contextual menu. I'm kind of shocked, since so many people rave about this OS. Huh."

8894,1,"Do not buy Pinnacle, Adobe, or Vegas (or any other program for that matter) without first downloading their 30-day trials (yes, they each have one). I did that, and found that Vegas spoke to my style. Click, drag, stop clicking. It's not that hard. Browse through your files and drag the video into the timeline (which you can customize to be the size that you want, since the layout has several boxes that can be rearranged to your liking). Go to the properties and change the play speed of a video to half as fast, and use the ACID music studio to slow the speed (and pitch) of the sound down as well. When you're done, make a DVD using the Architect. Use the Capture Video to work with your firewire or usb port (you may need an additional utility to transfer via a composite wire...the yellow, red, and white cords...). Basically, play with it in the trial, see if you like it, and maybe buy it. Best 90$ (I got it on sale) I ever spent.I made a feature length film with my high school buddies on this nifty thing. Sure, my harddrive is now devoured by the files (movie files are gigantic and require ram, for those of you who are complaining because you don't have the 512mb that it needs). I've successfully bluescreened a face onto a tree to make it look alive, and I even used the ACID program to lower the pitch of his voice - No one recognized who played him, and it looked magnificent. I know my stuff, so using only a solid color of cyan and a picture of one butterfly wing I downloaded from Google, I made a fluttering and flappy winged fairy that I bluescreened onto the screen where my actors had been talking to nothing. Using the transition elements, I made a Yu-Gi-Oh card-duelist scene where the defeated fighters would zip out via a spinning card slide. I was also able to edit the picture as I pleased, whether it meant coloring it red (evil..ooo!), making something filmed during the day appear night with the night filter, adding some light bursts to create some sweet special effects, or simply taking something that was filmed standard screen and making it wide screen. You can edit any effect or transition that you want, and you can even save your layout so the ""Night-Filter"" which is actually just a 'color-curve' can be sitting right next to the effect you customized: the blood-red filter.You can edit to so many video formats, but this is only the home-edition, remember, so don't expect high quality hollywood style formats (although the platinum does offer HDV formats, which is amatuer quality). The movie maker works with the DVD maker so that it'll even tell you what format works best on the DVD Architect. Here are a few: Mpeg-1, Mpeg-2, Quicktime, Real Video, AVI, wmv, and if you use the more complicated rendering selection you can go a bit further into the file formats that nobody uses or cares about.If you don't have a fast computer, don't buy this. Not because this software sucks on slow computers, but movie editing and dvd burning in general needs an up-to-date supply of harddrive (I advise 40gb at least) and ram (256mb, but preferably 512mb) (recommended requirements are the wisest to follow). That's the tech specs.This program suited my movie-making methods. I liked the drag-n-drop personally, as well as the many file formats, the dvd program, the music program, and all the cool effects as well. They even update their site (not often I must add) with cool things like DVD templates, moving background videos, backdrops, buttons, etc - but honestly, you can make anything you want through this program with some good ol' Paint and Google Images. You can either take a treasured childhood video, tinker the image a bit (if it was recorded badly it wont change much, sorry. *is a Film Major*) to make it look better and plop it on a DVD for family storage and treasure, OR you can do what I did. Make a 2hr 42min feature length film with a Sony Handycam, making even your own floating fairies and talking trees and epic adventures.May I also add that if you're willing to pay the (what is it?) 1000$ or 2000$ (or whatever it is) bill, you can even upgrade your studio by a download. But that's for the Pros. You aren't a Pro, are you? Vegas Movie Studio is wonderfully adapted from professional software to suite home movie editing. Try it. I dare you."

65943,2,"The problem with most novel-writing software I've been testing is that they involve a lot of ""writing before the writing."" While some planning is good, the amount of data entry these programs require detract from getting actual pages written, and the reality is that all those plans will likely change as you write anyway.This program is no exception. I find all the initial set-up to be cumbersome without yielding benefits that might ultimately actually streamline my process in the weeks or months ahead. (By contrast, for example, Final Draft - a screenwriting program - stores your characters' names so that you only need to type the first few letters and press Enter. You can also toggle your scenes from script to outline and back again without re-entering the information.)As for the more theoretic stuff, the story prompts are clearly taken from screenwriting which is formulaic due to the time contraints of a film. (For example, the lengths of scenes, act breaks, and total number of pages are far more restrictive to fit a 120-minute film than the scenes, chapters, and total pages of a novel.)Because a novel can be far longer than a 120-page screenplay, there's little here for creating stories with complex plots, for tracking subplots, or for creating backstory for characters. Instead you get a generic list of 'themes,' some of which are surprising vague.If you have little or no idea where your story is going yet, or if you're a writer whose work evolves, this program will be more hindrance than help. If you're the meticulous type who likes details of the minutae and rarely deviate from your outline once it's set, this may help you."

62517,1,"I buy ENCARTA every year, and BRITANNICA from time to time. This is my opinion:TEXT: Britannica's writing style is more sophisticated, and its authors are very well known. However, Encarta is not bad written at all, its authors are good and the contents are more or less the same, or better in the last versions.You can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year, but only quarterly (4 times). Encarta is updated EVERY WEEK with new articles and additions to the old ones.MULTIMEDIA and FEATURES: Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries, Atlas, 2 D and 3 D virtual tours, timeline, games ... It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text, multimedia and features are completely integrated.NAVIGATING: Encarta wins again. You only have to type a phrase, a word or de beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contains it. If you have typed the name of a small village lost in Senegal (e.g.), you see it in the Atlas without clicking again. If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you meet with what was looking for. To go ""jumping"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the ""Related Articles"" section. If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft's WORD is perfect.Navigating with Britannica is different. You do not get crazy, but ... I only say that, if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings.My computer is Pentium III 1000 Mhz 256 RAM, and I have copied Britannica into the hard drive (the same with Encarta). The fact is that it is very slow, and that takes a lot of RAM (50 % more or less). If you have other programs open, perhaps Britannica does not work. With Encarta, you do not have any problem.I hope my opinion is helpful for you."
55578,1,"I purchased this product after going through numerous reviews. I opted for an older version after ensuring that it meets my basic needs. The Acronis Secure Zone, a separate partition for backing up data, had been safely protecting my data for a number of weeks. You should try this product if you are on a budget. Otherwise, the newer version might be better - though I did not have a chance to try that out."
8517,1,"If any of you have expierienced past Scooby Doo games of this style, then you will understand this. In comparison, the voice acting in this is sub-par. The vocal animations are so generic that every word they speak looks just like the last. The load times between screens is a lot longer in this one than in past games. However, the puzzles are clever, and the background animations and layouts are very colorful and creative. Dropping you in many foreign locales. A good representation, and learning tool, of different cultures. My 5 year old enjoys this. But, myself, as a Scooby Doo fan, did not think that much of it. It was a bit shorter than previous games as well. Good game. Just not great. Hope the next volume shows more promise."

49651,2,"I have been using ACT since the old days when the product was owned by Symantec. In those days, Symantec had excellent online support and they also continued to support their products to make them compatible with changes in Windows and Microsoft Office. Sage is another story. Their online knowledgebase is weak and the only way to get company moderated forum support is to pay a fairly hefty fee (In general I don't like to pay money to debug some elses software). Sage released ACT 2007 in the fall of 2006 but they never really updated ACT 2007 to be compatible. Instead they issued a hotfix which I haven't tried yet. Also, even though it was released in 2006. ACT 2007 is still not compatible with Microsoft Office 2007. Sage pushes their customers to buy their new version every year in order to become compatible with other programs. However, the upgrade price is only a slight discount off of the new price so you end up buying the program all over again each year to be compatible with other programs. For what this program costs you don't seem to get much support in return."

39546,1,"At first I thought this would just be an okay game since I bought it randomly, but right from the start I knew it would be good. The graphics are great and I liked how everything was put together. I found some things very unique in this game such as the inventory display, how certain body parts were affected instead of the entire body, and how you can upgrade different types of skills. It has a very twisted plot that you gotta pay a lot attention to. Deus Ex (in my opinion) is easily comparable to Half-Life. This game greatly exceeded all my expectations for it!"
2141,1,"If you're still living in the stone age of Windows 95, then you must get Windows ME right now. The difference is virtually day and night. And for users of Windows 98 the upgrade is still helpful while at first there seems to be not that much of a difference. But Windows ME has some subtle features that I don't want to live without, like e.g. the automatic update feature that alerts you of updates and upgrades. Then there is the Windows Media Player which has excellent sound and video capabilities, which is almost a necessity in our day and age. The only difficulty we experienced so far, only occasionally though, is with the printing of E-mail notices which indicates an error message at times, but while we haven't figured out the problem yet we found a temporary solution to it. Overall, we can't give this upgrade 5 stars, because it's not as radical with super features that you may expect, but Windows ME has features you don't want to live without. Also, the operating system seems to be very stable without a freeze since installed, which wasn't the case with the previous version. It's well worth to upgrade now."
87055,1,"I purchased this game for my daughter and she absolutely loves it, just like she loves the Dogz and Catz games. She has the greatest fun putting her babies in the room and letting them play, taking care of them, feeding them, putting them down for a nap. She loves the realistic sounds they make and gets worried when they get ill and she can't make them better right away. My only gripe with the game is that the sounds don't work in XP; you have to turn them off or the game/computer will freeze. Fortunately, I found a patch online that fixes that problem - but I don't think it was a patch supplied by the game maker (in my opinion, they should have provided a fix for this ages ago) and it's why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. But once you have the patch, the game seems to work fine."
4572,1,"This product by Transparent Language excels in teaching Polish. I would recomend this program for many reasons. First of all they use many methods to teach such as games, conversation practices, and reading/speaking in Polish, ect. Secondly, they give you the tools to learn the basics of Polish such as a Grammar tutorial, alphabet reference, word dictation, ect. Another thing about Polish Now that I really appreciated was the vast amount of content(meaning language) that was in the final product. There were practice conversations for many situations and you could hear every Polish word said in the program. Finally, the depth of the program's features are truely amazing. It goes as far as allowing you to compare your pronunciation of words to the pronunciation of a native speaker's words. Transparent Language did an excellent job with this product and I highly recomend it to anyone looking to learn Polish."
19582,0,It is a great program. What I resent is the marketing tactic that require upgrade every three years whether you want to or not. If you do not upgrade by their dead line then upgrades are not available and one must pay full price later. That is just BS.

73371,1,"I found the Rosetta Stone Method effective to get me on the way to learn the language I needed: Russian. It was the very key break-thru element in my attempts to learn it. I would never had have success without it.It distinguishes itself very favorably from any other computer-based language training, in that it really sends one on the way, and keeps one there thru the first, always troublesome steps.However be informed, that it is not self-sufficient. You need a grammar, a dictionary, a good understanding of language structures (i.e. the grammatics of your own or another indogerman language), and more material. I took a lot of text and audio (internet radio) from the internet. I used also other audio/textbook courses to get more volume and substance. Even Mickey Mouse and some pre-school children books in the target language have been helpful. This mix made it sufficient, with Rosetta as the key driving element.Rosetta Stone does not tell you about these, but the implicit assumption is that of accompanying a teached course. Like the NASA astronauts had, evidently. They were not on their own."

While it doesn't have all the customisation features, it does what it does do very well, and that is to backup my data without me having to worry about it.I quickly encountered a problem with copying to an external drive attached to another iMac on my home network. It would copy all files every time rather than copy only the files which had changed. With more than a little trepidation, I contacted ProSoft support. They were excellent. After a couple of emails, my problem was solved.I wish all companies had support organisations that worked this well to support their customers."

That was somewhat disappointing, especially since I'm hardly an arcade shark."
62525,1,"This upgrade offers interface and other improvements, plus OS X compatibility. OS 9 users get document auto-activation of fonts. When you open a document under OS 9, Suitcase automatically activates any fonts used in the document. Unfortunately, OS X doesnt support this feature. OS 9 users can activate fonts using the control strip or the application. OS X requires that Suitcase is running before activating fonts. You can set it to auto open on startup. Then minimize it and leave it in the dock and it will be there when you need it. You can activate fonts from the Dock or the application. Suitcase will also collect fonts to a single folder for sending out print jobs. You also get FontBook, an excellent sample page printing tool. The OS 9 features work under fine under Classic mode. OS X supports the new cross-platform OpenType fonts. Its ease of use and OS X support make it a must have upgrade."

THIS IS THE ABSOLUTELY WORST ITEM THAT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FROM THIS SITE OR ANYWHERE!!!!The software worked for only ONE computer!!! NUMEROUS EMAILS to wincleaner are fully ignored.THIS COMPANY IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!Do not be fooled by trolls who give this product more than one star! The company must have employees log on to give this product favorable evaluations, but read the truth for the numerous people who have been robbed by wincleaner.Offered serial number, valid purchase info., but wincleaner does not even take the time to respond w. activation code.Save your money and buy air!"

86172,1,"I enjoyed this game alot! In the beginning you decide the number of people that travel with you, and their names and ages.you can also pick where you start from, your name, what year it is, what your job is, (the amount of money you start out with depends on what your job is) extra skills, what month it is, and where you want to go. (your options depend on what year you pick.) then you buy supplies and animals and set off.( you also get to decide what wagon train that you set off with.)you can hunt if you have a firearm, bullets, and gunpowder.and when you come to rivers,you can check the conditions of the river. and if you choose wisely in whether you caulk the wagon and float, ford the river, take the ferry, take the toll bridge, or hire some Indians to help, you might not tip your wagon! there are forts, towns, and trading posts along the way, and you can trade with people. When you come to forks in the road, you get to decide which road to take. if you don't rest (you get to choose when you rest and for how long)or don't have healthy food, you or one of your companions might get sick.And if you don't have the right medicines to give them or yourself, you might die. You also, get to decide how many hours per day that you travel, and how much food you eat per day. If you come to a desert,you decide if you wait till the evenings to travel or if you travel by day. get ready and take your journey on ""THE OREGON TRAIL"" buy it today!"

68572,1,"I think this is a great kit for the price. The card and software installed with no major issues, and the analog video capture from my old camcorder works great.

I only have 512MB and it starts swapping during editing.Otherwise, I highly recommend this product."
75903,1,"Pros: A very thorough introduction to Panther OS X for novice Mac users such as recent converts from Windows PC's.Cons: No index that would permit navigation to specific topics within a given lecture.Target audience: Dave Marcus, the lecturer, says this DVD training video is for novice and intermediate users. In fact, novice users should know something about computers or should be recent converts from the PC world. Intermediate Mac are presumed to be OS 9 users, but could also be folks who have learned some things on their own. These users will learn a lot from this DVD, but also will have to sit through quite a bit of familiar material to do so.Method: You listen to Marcus and watch his screen as he does things on his Mac. You can select chapters and subsections, but there is no index. Unlike a book, you cannot easily skim over what you know while looking for something unfamiliar to you except by moving the slider that gives the progress on the video. This in my opinion is not an efficient way to skim.The major sections areI. Workflow and System Set-UpII. Panther ApplicationsIII. Internet and NetworkingIV. Optimization and TroubleshootingV. ConclusionEach of the major sections is divided into subsections that last 5-15 minutes. These relatively brief lectures allow you to watch the DVD in short time intervals rather than having to watch an hour or so per viewing.The major applications covered include everything found in the default doc installed by Apple on the standard Macintosh. Most of the applications are explored in exhausting detail, covering each and every button on the GUI. The sole exceptions are the iLife applications of which only iTunes, iPhoto and iMovie are reviewed briefly. The reason for this is that iLife could be a DVD video all by itself (it is not offered by Digital Media). Most of the time, the depth of the presentation seemed to be appropriate for a novice mac user. The one exception was Expose, which I think could have been done in half the time. Probably the most interesting application be presented was Sherlock, which I probably never would have explored had I not seen his lecture.Some things that were not covered, but should have been in my opinion include the following.Software installation: it may be obvious for experienced users but may be perplexing for novices, especially when downloading applications from the web.I would like to have seen some introductory remarks about color management, especially since this is one of the major reasons people move from the PC to the Mac.No mention was made of the text editor. Few new users will expect the ""end"" key on the keyboard to take them to the end of the file as opposed to the end of the line. They are not likely to guess that Control-a and Control-e are the means of quickly moving to the beginning or end of a line.Although this review may sound more negative than positive, I believe that this DVD would work well for most novice Panther OS X users, particularly new converts to the Mac OS such as myself. It's an easy way to learn the about the OS. However, I recommend that you also purchase a book as a reference for subsequent review of specific items. Intermediate users may find learning from a book to be more efficient than this DVD."
74927,1,"When I got my computer back from the shop and realized that all of my Microsft Office programs were taken off, I was devastated. I didn't want to buy a new computer to get all of the programs that I had wanted so there was one thing to do. I bought this program. Never have I bought a program that was so easy to install and operate. With Microsft XP Standard for Students and Teachers you get four office programs. They are Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Power Point.You receive three discs when you get this. One is to install the programs, one is to download content for each program, such as clip art, and the last disc is to train you so you are able to learn how to operate each of the programs. I use the last disc often. Once you install the discs you must either activate your programs through the internet or over the phone. After that, you are the owner and operator of four wonderful and extremely helpful Micrsoft Office programs.This set is specifically designed for students and teachers and if you are not on of the two you should go with a general set of these programs. This ste is great for a student or teacher that uses the computer for graphs, typing, spreadsheets, etc. This is the best way to go if you want to get all four of these Microsoft Office products. This is very simple to use and if you have any problems you can use one of the given discs so you can learn how to operate the programs. I really recommend this product. It is very ehlpful and will be used a lot. Get this and our computer work will be much easier.Happy Computing!!!"

13600,1,"For me the upgrade was a great thing.There had always been things about Office XP that just didn't work right.After the software was loaded, indeed I had some configuration issues. It worked, but it wasn't slick.But Microsoft Help stepped in. The software support guy took control of my computer using net-meeting and looked at all the configuration issues. Turned out to be some conflicts with my virus protection (I've had these before, P.N.) and with some Microsoft add-ins. Point is, he made the conflicts go away.Microsoft ""help"" has been a sometime thing, in the past.Today, it rose to the top shelf.I am quite happy with Office 2003."

54296,1,"The program has worked really well for my son. He is in medical school, and he uses it just about everyday. He records his class, and that way he can set and really listen instead of trying to get notes. Then when he gets home he prints off the notes.

I already have several pages of a new web site done, complete with photos, buttons and other objects. I have referred to the book and help sections only twice. Everything else was easy to figure out without a hassle. I would definately reccomend this software for beginners as well as more advanced users. This software is fun, easy use and understand."

45024,1,This game is a good game for younger kids. It is not violent and teaches kids the bacis of Math. This game is a fun and challanging game to play. Lots of kids don't like doing problems so this game can make it a fun way for kids to learn Math

It would take a monstrous upgrade of many components to require another phone call - please consider that &quot;ugly&quot; listed below is not nearly as ugly as described."
3665,1,There are certainly a lot of diverse opinions here. My take is that the software needs to run and it should have all the features that it says it does. This has been the case here. I want to burn disks and edit files. I've been able to do that using this software. The installation was surprisingly quick. It is a huge program but I didn't have to keep entering a yes when it installed each program. It treated everything as one big program.Using it has been a no brainer. It's all written out so you just choose what you want. It has the widescreen video support I wanted and the video formats I needed. So far this product hasn't let me down.
20867,1,"Bought this on recommendation from a friend. It is a great Access database-like program. Has a few buggy things about it. For example, the shopping list will combine like items with like measurements but won't combine 1 pound butter with 2 cups butter. Could have been more thought put into the user interface. Can't print from File > Print. Have to first edit print design to select new output format."
89509,1,"I totaly disagree with the previous review. I had this product and it performed as advertised. Burned almost every game I tried. I've used their product for a couple years and I know that they discontinued this product and put its features into another one called Virtual Drive Suite which I upgraded to. You probably couldn't get support because they don't make the product anymore. Anyway, I highly recommedns this."
42004,0,"I work with spreadsheets all the time so immediately after I got my Palm I started looking for some sort of spreadsheet program. This program works pretty good you can see Excel spreadsheets on your hand held and Word documents and edit them and copy them to your PC and vice versa. Some annoying problems, though. The program doesn't synchronize with files on the computer it mearly copies one over the other. If it detects that the file on the computer and the file on the hand held have both been modified it gives an error. Also, there are too few formulas provided. I have a spreadsheet to calculate subnet masks that will not work with this. Only the most basic formulas are provided. I called Dataviz tech support and there are no formula upgrade packs either. Lastly, the price of this is pretty spendy. I keep kicking myself when I found I could have just bought a new handheld with this software included for what I spent on this software alone!"

27138,1,I've only played the demo but it is (...)It's great fun! Especially for people that can't have their own horse yet but desperatley wants one!(Like me.) I reccomend this game to all horse lovers. It is the best horse game in the world!!!!
9466,1,This game is very close to being my favorite . Next to equestriad . I think it is very correct it's horses movements except for the lead no game can grasp the concept of this . I really like all the competions it's not all about cleaning your horse and I like the Idea of making my own schedule . Think is great . I love the dressage part on some games they only do some of the movements this one does all.I would suggest this to anyone that is a kid at heart it's a little hard for younger kids to play.
80696,2,"This may be a fine product, but I will never know. Don't buy the product if you hope to use it on a PowerPC Mac running OS 10.4 and OS 9.2. While the system requirements for the CD state that the CD works with any Mac OS after 7.X it does not appear to be possible to even install it on a modern Apple computer. (Caveat: This may run on an Intel Mac with Bootcamp, but I haven't tested it in that operating environment.)I am not a software engineer, but I am a sophisticated user of Apple computers. My guess is that if I cannot install this program on my system, your average Apple computer user will not be able to either. Just a world to the wise in the we-don't-support-mac software wars."

60079,1,"Unlike the above review, I have no problems with Studio 8. I capture video, edit video and burn DVDs. I have it at home and at work, no problems either place. The majority of problems people are seeing is due to their systems being overloaded with garbage freeware, underpowered systems, low budget, off brand components with inferior drivers. This is very powerful, easy to use video editing software at consumer prices. I still have not received my copy of Studio 9, can't wait to do widescreen movies."

80825,1,"I will preface this review by saying that I purchased the 2004 edition just 3 days before the 2005 edition was released, but Trend did me right and gave me a free upgrade. That's a plus right out of the starting gate.I originally switched to Trend from Norton after having slowdowns and resource shortages. Norton is very large and very slow, but by and large it worked for me. I was hesitant to make the switch, but I decided to do it anyway and see how Trend's product works. I have not been disappointed. First off, the memory footprint for this package is about half that of Norton when everything is turned on. For me, that's important - Norton takes up huge amounts of memory and slows the system down, where Trend takes up less room and seems to be a lot faster at execution time.Trend has always had a very fast and very effective antivirus. This latest version is no exception. However, where this package seems to shine most brightly in the antivirus arena is in the timeliness of pattern file updates. Less than a week after the release of a particular email virus, Trend caught it arriving in my inbox and terminated it before it could do anything. To have a pattern for a brand new virus and already be able to handle it is a very, very good thing.The firewall itself is quite effective and it seems to do its job very efficiently. Where it tends to bother people is in the fact that it is a very quiet firewall and it does not notify for every little thing like Norton or ZoneLabs do. This may or may not agree with you, but for me I'm content that it's working in the background and isn't bothering me with every little thing that happens.The spyware detection feature seems to have come of age, and even after running SpyBot S&D; and Ad-Aware, it still found spyware on my system. It did a good job cleaning up and it did everything very fast and efficiently.There are a couple of things I cannot test, as I am on dialup. There are new network protection features that allow remote security administration for systems on the network running Trend's suite, and there is also a neat feature that loooks for intruders on wireless networks. Considering that cybersquatting on wireless networks is very common, this is an important feature that should be in all security suites. If you are running a wireless network, this feature will be invaluable.Trend includes a parental control feature in its suite, and it works in a fashion similar to Norton's and ZoneLab's equivalents. You pick your categories to block, and you're done. However, there is a flaw in their implementation - the blocking only seems to work with MS Internet Explorer. So, if you use Mozilla/FireFox or Opera, you're out of luck if you want to use the URL blocking.There is also an antispam feature, but it is not going to prevent spam from arriving in your inbox. Rather, it simply flags questionable messages as spam in the subject at delivery. This can help with sorting and disposal, but it will not keep it from being delivered. In my opinion, spam should never reach the email client if you have an antispam solution in place, so I regard this particular feature as ineffective. I suppose it is better than nothing, though, and many users will find it helpful - I don't. I didn't like Norton's, either, which works the same way.One interesting feature that Trend sports is ""Outbreak Notification"" which is used to alert users when a new, high-risk threat is circulating. Users will get a notification when a new high-profile virus is spreading, and that can be helpful if you're relying on manual updates.Trend Micro has put together a winner in their 2005 edition of their PC-Cillin Internet Security suite. It does not lack any major features, and the majority of the things they have included are very good and very effective. There are a few soft spots, but these are not critical to system security, and overall Trend is quickly catching up to the ""big boys."" If you want a fast, small-footprint security solution that competes very competently with the likes of Norton, ZoneLabs and McAfee, Trend is an excellent contender."

39163,0,"I was so very disappointed after spending almost $100 on a product to find that the instructional literature was written in a typeface so tiny that it is illegible without a magnifying glass. Given that many people who become interested in genealogy do so in their middle and later years when eyes are failing, it is a disservice to the consumer to print basic instructions for use in a print that is smaller than the small print on your insurance forms. Had I known the instructional materials, though ample in volume would be so microscopic in type, I would not have bought this product. So unless you have 20-20 vision and still enjoy straining your eyes to read I would suggest you buy a different product."

78692,1,"PCsync 3.0 works great -- as advertised. However, installation isn't quite as easy as advertised (is it ever?).Here's what happened as I connected two laptops running Windows 2000: After intially installing the software, I found that the two computers would not communicate with each other through the serial port. I went through all of the troubleshooting actions suggested in the documentation and came up empty.Out of desperation, I uninstalled the software from one of the machines and tried to do what PCsync refers to as a &quot;remote install.&quot; By doing this, I realized that the machines were unable to access the COM1 ports through the serial cables. The COM1 port (on both machines) was busy because of the Palm Desktop HotSync program running in the system tray (bottom right of Windows). I closed Palm on both computers and PCsync instantly worked.One would think that such a simple program conflict would be detected by the program (our outlined in the troubleshooting documentation), but it wasn't."

It does not work perfectly on every single document, but usually any clean up is minimal. I am very happy with it. For $50 it has saved me hundreds by not having to retype stuff from PDFs. I noticed someone made a comment about it not working on encrypted files - it says that one the box and on the web site. The stupidity of people never fails to amaze me!"
87469,2,"I bought this software to aid with navigation in the car (or motorhome) and while I'm pleased with the ability of the USB GPS unit to receive a signal, I'm less than pleased with the functionality of the software. You can get detailed turn by turn directions after entering a begining and an end address - but I can do that for free on the internet. What dissapointed me most was that the GPS functionality is nothing more than placing a blip on a map where you are and telling you how fast you are going (like I needed that). There's no active trip calculation - no ETA to next turn, no indicator where you are on your current list of directions, and heaven forbid if the thing actually told you there's a turn approaching (boy, we're spoiled aren't we?). It's a nice and user friendly interface but the GPS functionality was obviously an afterthought that didn't get much effort."
18686,1,"I started with Quicken'94 then upgraded to quicken'98. I've never had to call technical support, even when I added Quicken 2004 to my Mac. All my Data transferred over without a glitch. I have many individual stocks, some with daily price entries, and all of it is there. Most of the bad reviews listed here are probably problems with their operating software or bugs in their systems. The only time quicken did not work for me was when my directories were screwed up. Running a good utilities program straightened out the whole computer and everything worked better. Don't be afraid to buy this software! It is top-notch!"
14595,2,"Despite mixed reviews, I bought FP2002 mainly because HoTMeTaL had just become unavailable. I'm a heavy and long-term user of Office products, and am entirely comfortable with them. Purpose of this purchase was to draft look/feel and content of a new web site, which I would hand over to a professional designer for tweaking.Took a very reasonable couple of weeks' effort making what I wanted. Two major issues were unexpected non-ease of importing formatted material from Office, and weird instability in text/graphics positioning: stuff jumps all over the place w/o warning. (I'm running WinXP Home, in case it matters.)Then passed the saved files to a pro running DreamWeaver on Mac. He is completely unable to open many, and others all seem to have a bunch of Java in the HTML code. (Yes, I did turn off all those unneeded options first.) It doesn't seem to be possible to save as simple HTML files with common code.It's going to cost me a great deal of time and money to repeat the whole exercise from scratch. Wish MS hadn't dropped their 30-day free trial, but I can see why.Right for some, no doubt. But if you want compatible code, portable files, or any real idea of what's going on in there (a familiar story with MS?), run away fast."

8730,1,"Very charming, lots of fun, and good for repeated play. The controls are easier to use than a mouse. So far the only thing that troubled my daughter (4) was finding the right position from which to change a signal. Otherwise she picked it up quickly and proudly taught my wife how to drive Thomas.There are four scenarios plus several mini-games and places where you can see short videos. It takes a while to do everything. It's also fun to just drive around seeing the Sodor scenery and meeting other engines.This game is much better than Trouble on the Tracks. ToT involves a bunch of boring jobs that never appealed to my daughter. And the ToT software performed erratically on our old PC (AMD 500 MHz, no graphics card).The voices are different from the videos, but my daughter doesn't seem to care."

48539,1,"Running this software in OSX+Classic mode will result in occasional lagginess -- not a big deal until you're a speed typist. My kids (ages 5 and 8) love this game, and it has really improved their touch typing skills. It's also a favorite at school."

91012,1,"I am always skeptical to buy the first version of any new software product, but I was truly blown away by this product. It is as comprehensive as I have ever seen and the user interface is fun and easy to use. Not only are the computer animations terrific (my kids especially love them), I have found the ability to search and cross reference and look up encyclopedia articles of great value. In just three weeks of using this product, I feel it has really helped me get a better understanding of the greatest book ever written. I have never seen a software product that was so well suited for 4 year olds through 70 year olds - there really is something for everyone here. Strongly recommend this as a gift for christmas."

46217,1,"I tried what seems like everything to do the simple tasks I wanted to do: maintain my address book (with some flexibility to attach things like driving directions), and keep all of those little snippets of information that couldn't be neatly and logically kept elsewhere without learning a complex application.AnyTime was my answer, and I've been using it for years. The address book is not going to do what Act! does, but it's not supposed to. It's certainly robust enough for my needs, and I'm able to do things like export to my cell phone.The other part I use heavily is the notebook. It's super-simple, but I keep everything in it that doesn't have another home.Now, I noticed that the latest version now has a password manager. I'll definitely check that out, as it's one of the things I actually use the notebook for!There's lot more functionality, but, unfortunately, my job forces me into another calendar system. Still, AnyTime, for me, has been that one simple, elegant tool that solved a whole bunch of ""why can't my computer just do *this*!?"" questions.One of those apps you just grow to love!"

5995,1,"Since Intuit's has expressed such contempt for their customers with this years release of unannounced spyware and their legendary absence of customer support, I felt compelled to make the switch to TaxCut, although with some reluctance. Not to worry!! TaxCut operates very much like TurboTax, but without the headaches. Being a first time user I found some areas a little confusing, since it is a different product. I will definitely stay with TaxCut next year. Next to go is Quicken. Intuit has shot themselves in the foot."
2742,0,"Good: This is a user friendly program for keeping track of finances. You can electronically download checking,savings,lines of credit, and investment(including retirement) transactions and balances.Bad: Loans are not available for electronic download, so you have to manually input loan information. The program feels like a work in progress. I have discovered some bugs that cannot be fixed by downloading the updates.Overall, the program is helpful, but look elsewhere if you don't have a tolerance for slightly imperfect software."
35476,1,"This is a response to the review NOT for true beginners, March 5, 2004 Reviewer: A software user from Somewhereinthe USA. You may be a software user, but you don't know what immersion means.

How do you think babies learn to talk?"
23398,1,"Partly because of the feature that allows you to peek at your opponents cards. If you can avoid the temptation to do so, your results will be less spectacular.Seriously, this game plays quite well. The advisor plays a very tight game and I've done better (without cheating) using my own judgement. One feature I really enjoy is the lightning bolt that jumps to the end of play on a hand after you fold. You can play a lot of hands in very little time.Overall, a very playable game without all the bells and whistles that usually just annoy after a while."
17642,1,This game is pretty easy when you get to know it. There are 4 chapters in the game...Chapter 1:Employee Of The Year:eeeesayChapter 2:Hitting Rock Bottom:more easyI`ll put the other 2 chapters in another review.
13860,1,"I purchased this program when it first came out. To be honest with you, the program itself [stinks]. It is hard to view the samples that you have used in a composition. The samples themselves are wonderful though. They are of high quality. I have used these samples in other programs that I have and have created a number of tracks that are really good."

14079,1,"Purchased this based off the PC Magazine award and very happy. Spyware is one of those things that you just have to keep searching for a solution if one product doesn't fix it, 95% solution is not enough. After numerous free and one other paid products happy to find Spyware Doctor was enough that I didn't need to keep searching anymore. Only downside is that I still need to keep running another virus product, looking forward to being able to have solutions all from one company."
80990,1,"This game is awesome and an intrigue at the same time. The story is absolutly fantastic and the remastering of the ambiance is surrealisticly moving. I never saw such an amazing game that is nonviolent and coherent. It is hard to find such a grandious game like Myst because it is not very contemporary to see companies that dedicate their precious hour to create a very astounding and educational game. I play this game all the time and I feel pretty confortable with it, even though I finished it. But the end was an enigma because there is no end. That's cheesy and redundant because I was relating this game to our life and as a human we all die. I think that if the producers were aiming to make this game to look real, they should interconnect it with a normal human life. I hope that you find this game as something you cherish rather than value it as a simple and ordinary game. If a person buys this game and don't like deep observational and mysterious games please don't buy it because myst is a game of discovery and the quest for the truth. I hope you enjoy the game as I did. BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
45063,1,"I watched the American Idol TV show and then I went out and bought this game. This game actually has MORE stuff in it than the show did!First, you get to create your own character. There's not too many choices at first, but if you play for a while you can collect a lot of stuff.Then you get to play singing and dancing games! The dancing games are pretty cool and my favorite is the singing practices where someone sings to you and you have to sing back. You can record a song with your voice and use it in the game too.After you win a game, you go make a video of your performance. I think this is the best part. All kinds of dance moves, cameras, lighting and special effects. Then, if you want, you can put your video up on the website and people can vote on it, just like in the show!It takes a long time to get enough stuff to make a really cool video, so don't give up.I'd recommend this to anyone who liked the American Idol TV show and also to anyone who likes to sing or put together dance performances."
34471,1,"I'm a beginner at layout programs and even though the interface is very similar with Illustrator and Photoshop it took me quite a while before I understood that in order to change the color of the gradient slider from greyscale I had to mix the gradient swatch in the swatches palette and that I needed to add colors that I wanted to use in that palette and not on the color palette...a few of the learning tasks took a bit longer, cause I was used to finding them elsewhere! We're getting along better now and I am amazed at the way that ID works with type, Open Type in particular - all these things that you can do with OT, wow! Then being able to use transparency is great and not needing to go back & change the original files is great...and when you do need to do that you just choose in Id to open the file in PS or Illustrator - very fast, you edit them, you save and they update automatically in ID! And not only is ID easy to use with Adobe products but also with Microsofts office products - being able to bring in tables from word or excel and keep the formatting. Because ID happens to use all these ""Heading 1"" etc, that we are used to seeing in the office products as well, they are exactly the same in both ID as they are in Word and the rest of the office suit!There has been an update to ID as well (2.0.1) that solves some printing issues. Keeping that in mind and that Adobe listens to their customers I think it is well worth the switch from Quark. However I am a PC user, so I've never had to consider Quark. And comparing ID to Pagemaker...na they are not meant for the same thing and ID has a lot more control."
86183,1,"I love this software! I was stuck with the same hairsytle for years because I was too scared to change it for fear of what I would look like and because I had no idea of what to change it to! This software gave me the opportunity to try new looks instantly! I was then able to print out the style I liked, take it to a hairdresser and have the confidence to go through with the cut! I get so many compliments now on my new look. Give it a shot, you have nothing to lose!"
55080,0,"I had purchased TurboTax, installed it on my old computer not knowing I would then purchase another computer later. Now I cannot use my software, and Intuit will not replace the software because it is tied to my old computer. I guess the Macrovision Safecast is the security piece of this software. Do not install this software until you are absolutely sure you need to do so otherwise you'll have to pay for it more than once. TurboTax is great software, but the product registration has no flexiblity built into it for the user, buyer beware."

53334,0,"This is not one of the better Disney programs. It's charming at first, but gets old quite fast. There doesn't seem to be that many different things to do on it. It is fun, however, to make up a dance,arrange the music and hallway, and play the food game, but one can only do that so many times. You also rarely get to see the beast. I recommend this to those with a short attention span."

33147,1,"I can do anything you can do only I can do it on the first try. I just completed my upgrade to Jaguar from 9.2. It was easy and more importantly problem free.To be honest I am a long time Mac user and as such I may be slightly biast in favor of all things Mac. However, my boyfriend was not, and he insisted that we have a PC in addition to our iMac. He is now a convert!!!!!!!!!! I took three people, all of whose jobs are to provide tech support to the unfortunate PC owner, to get his laptop up and running! I guess PC's provide lots of job security.More importantly as long as you have Microsoft Office for Macs you can switch back and forth between platforms no problem. Plus, according to Microsoft, their office suite for Macs is better than the one they make for there own operating system!"
25766,1,I just installed the program..easy...I started my internet explorer..by this time i would get about 50 pop-ups...I HAVNT HAD ONE...if for nothing else get it for the pop-up protection!! booh yeah no more pop-ups!!
75758,0,better than some of the alternatives. If you just are looking for a couple of sounds this might be worth the $5. Certainly better than the Snap! 2000 Sound Effects.

59102,1,"Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006The program itself is awesome!! You can do a lot of neat photographic tricks with it. However, the seller-Brownie Books is a different story!

I feel like I was taken for a sucker!!"
66791,1,"I played this game a lot when I was little, and I think it did great things for my creative development. This game gives you a blank screen and lots of easy to use tools and lets you make a movie. The buttons are big and the game features a kid friendly voice to explain what each does, so it's really easy for kids to use, even if they can't read. There's lots of backgrounds, music, shapes, and silly animated characters you can plop down into your scene to create a story. You can even record your own voice over and narrate the action.Looking back, I think this game may have had a lot to do with my eventual choice of a career in animating. This isn't a production level movie creation software by any means, you can't even export your movies out of the software itself, but I think it's worth the money as a great creative game for kids to mess around with. I recently replayed this game, and it still runs on my windows xp computer.In short, I highly recommend it."

13360,1,"I was a bit put off by some of the reviews, so I went with a trial copy, and found myself pleasantly surprised. The latest version installed without incident, and has performed every function on my PC without any bugs.I was able to clean over 2 GB of debris from my drive, fix 142 registry problems, and defrag my drive (from 41% fragmented to 2% fragmented) in the span of an hour.I was also able to set up the scheduling without any problems, and get the antivirus and firewall set up with minimal effort. Overall, I'd say that while the product may not be for everyone, it's definitely replacing my existing utility software on the other computers in my home network."
6700,1,"Great game! He really enjoys it. Just beware that there are no instructions or at least there were not with mine so your child may need some of your guidance but it has been fun to sit and help him and us figure it out together.

9780,1,"The world's greatest fighters have been invited to a tournament, no ""THE TOURNAMENT."" Liu Kang (Robin Shou) descendant of Kung Lao, wants to avenge the death of his brother. Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) is not a fake. Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras) has a crush on a one-eyed man. All three of these fighters are part of ""Mortal Kombat."" Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) is an immortal, but not as much as Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jean-Claude Van Damme. Save your pity for the weak, this movie isn't for the squeamish. Liu Kang takes no prisoners and steps on lizards. Johnny Sonya Blade crunches and gets drooled on by a disgusting Kano. ""Get over here!"" Oh yes, remember Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) who has a bad accent and needs to change out of his pajamas. Finally, Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) does not look like she's five hundred years-old. Based on the video game, the movie delivers. You can avoid the sequel if you wish. ""This is the part where you fall down"" and laugh at this hilarious review."
54037,1,"Oh yes introducing the new & inproved Roxio Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 !!!I believe almost every cd-r burning newbie started with Adaptec Easy Cd Creator ...which was good. Then Adaptec relinquished that department to another of it's branch called Roxio ...which was good also.Roxio had great ideas and vision for Easy CD Creator. It changed the core engine and bulked up the software program to include alot of extras to enchance audio burning (mp3s, wma, etc.) , photo cds, video creation, and label creation ....Roxio made it hip to burn!Things were going good, Roxio partnered with alot of CD-RW drive manufacturers, offering the basic version of Roxio Easy CD Creator. Hence most new owners of cd-rw burners used it and liked it.Off in the distance, A STORM WAS BREWING, Microsoft was going to introduce something BIG .....Windows XP!!!While other software companies were worried about compatibility with WinXP, Roxio was not. It has already teamed up with Microsoft to include it's burning software engine in Microsoft's Windows Media Player and felt quite confident in Easy CD Creator's compatibility with the new operating system.Roxio relaxed during the period when WinXP was shipping to stores ...which was Bad!Almost every user with Roxio Easy CD Creator (basic & platinum) upgrading to WinXP began reporting problems. We're not talking about minor problems here! Huge drastic problems were happening all over the world. Hard drive crashes, blue screen of deaths, cd-rw drives not being recognized, crucial back-up data lost, it was coaster hell...it was like Ford's Pinto,Roxio was in disbelieve, stunned senseless. How could it small support team handle millions of angry users? It couldn't and it couldn't refund all it's products. Eventuallly it just ignored everybody. Worst yet it's software engine was heavily entrenched in the old operating system, uninstalling Easy Cd Creator was useless.Enter Nero...What was bad for Roxio became good for Ahead's Nero Burning Rom. Nero was not as pretty but it was small, simple and fast, it got the job done! Mass migration to Nero became the norm and things were good once again.Finally after a long time Roxio fixed it's Easy CD Creator to be compatible with WinXP and incorporated alot of features from Nero, but too late the word was out: Roxio equals Trouble. Use Nero instead!This mantra is still being repeated at this very moment.I've been testing Roxio Easy CD & DVD Creator 6 for a day now, throwing everything at it to make it crash (burning vcds & svcds, everything at different speeds). Nope ...no crashes and get this ...I think it's faster than Nero in CD to CD copy, about half a minute.Roxio has spent alot of R&D; with this version and it shows. I praised them for getting rid of that troublesome DirectCD. It replaced it with something called ""Drag to Disc"" which is more universally accepted. It's even compatible with Nero's InCD formatted discs. (It replaces the functionality of Nero's InCD, so it's safe to uninstall InCD).Now please keep in mind I have a pretty good system, P4, WinXP with plenty of RAM.PROS:-This baby is pretty! Great for Newbies-You can burn everything under the sun-Now it officially supports DVD and SVCD-Includes a 390 page manual and Flash tutorials-Huge improvements to it's DVD & Photo menu creator-Can burn large data, spanning across multiple discs-It's alot faster than any previous versions-Supports Plextor's Power Rec featureCONS:-It's huge in terms of file size, over 400 MB-It's expensive, (buy it on special)"

4218,1,"I must truly applaud the staff on their extraordinary animation works. The variety and originality in various 3D effects is very apparent. Being the first timer to adopt the 3D technology in my business, I'd like to share my experience as a previously upset user but turned out to be a very pleased customer -- inadequate system resources or graphic card configurations (e.g., the cheep integrated video card) are the main reason that I have had continuous problems in performance and quality. Once this has been resolved, everything turns to be very smooth and great. Many evidences of this kind of change similar to my experience can be seen in the public community forum from the 3D-Album website.Being only moderately knowledgeable on computers, the software does require some learning curve for me. It is not a wizard-driven program for beginners. After getting familiar with necessary terminology and concepts, I found the program to be quite easy to work with. More to the point, folks at support as well as in the community forum are very helpful. I've learned a lot from them and now quite knowledgeable in this area. Fewer software products today can provide such a great and dedicated support. Good results can be seen by many examples that users have posted in the community forum, ranging from novice to professional."
13423,0,"First off, let me just say the graphics and music in this game were absolutely wonderful. Very relaxing and almost magical in a calming way. However, whatever calm relaxing feelings that our conjured up through graphics and music quickly fade away in frustration. Walk-through's are a must have for this game, not because the puzzles are that difficult, but because the game doesn't give you enough clues to figure out what, where or when you are supposed to do something. Simple instructions or hints from the many dialogue conversations would really help this game along. I was also a bit disturbed by the 'fish-bowl' look of some of the many character's faces. The Mayan &amp; Celtic worlds were fascinating and a lot of fun, but frustrating in areas. I still haven't finished the game because I missed one of the &quot;have to do&quot; actions and I don't feel like redoing everything. Get this one on sale. It's worth the time to play, but don't expect to get through this one without some outside help."

But it is easy to use and works reliably to produce very decent DVD from mini digital video camera tapes, as well slideshows from digital pictures from my still camera. Lots of fonts for text and multitude of transitions. I used Pinnacle Studio 9 for a few years with good success, but as soon as I upgraded to 10 the darned thing stopped working. Cant use it even after formatting HD on PC and reinstalling the 9 version. Stay away from Pinnacle Studio. Better bet is the Arcsoft software."

3801,1,"If you use Windows you have to understand folders and that organizing the files is important. The first time I used EMC8 I was astounded to find that it had put all my photos on my pc into the media manager. The photos were in different folders on my pc so I thought I would have to put everything into one folder. It turns out that the Roxio media mgr. will track all the media as long as the extension is correct. For example, I just made a slide show and thought that I would have to do the usual browse folders. Instead the media mgr put thumbnails of all the photos on my pc. It also continues to search for media files so it is a fluid program.I don't know why another user said that you can only choose 2 seconds between photos in the slide show creator. I was able to choose 20 seconds. I have never made a slide show so fast. The media manager is a big part of that since I didn't have to search for all my photos and put them in one folder. I can skip using explorer and my computer for organizing the media files from now on and just use the Roxio manager. As a long time Windows user I'm used to having to keep on top of organizing my files, but now it is no big deal."

If you've captured footage from your analog camcorder at 352x480 and give it to PE as imported media, it assumes that you want your final project to have a distorted picture with wide black margins on the sides, i.e. it assumes your source has 'missing' pixels. If your using PE for the straight and narrow, (DV in/out or DVD out) it's probably fine. If you're looking for a general purpose movie editor that accepts a wide variety of input formats and has the flexibility to create a wide variety of output formats, don't buy PE."

However, the second half of the novel was very weak. Perhaps because some of the characters that I really enjoy in the Robb universe got little to no air time - such as Nadine, Mira, Mavis. I was also disappointed that Laine and Max didn't show up in part two until the very very end. Oh well, I suppose it was an experiment in writing, but I wouldn't look forward to another split adventure."

26846,1,"If you are looking for a quick, fun and easy start to another language without spending a ton of money, Instant Immersion Japanese is just the ticket. Having both a man and woman speak the language helps to pick up different nuances in words and phrases. The games really help to reinforce these. Other than playing back recordings to check your own pronunciation there is no way to be certain you are speaking correctly but as a beginning I can not recommend this program more highly. Thinking of learning another language? Try this series before you invest heavily. It is a super bargain!"

85321,1,"I have been using McAfee products for the last 7 years. I did not have any problems with viruses, but it is true, I try to stay out of dubious web sites. I purchase my McAfee software from Amazon every year because of their rebates and every time I see 1 - 2 star ratings. It is unfair. Their products are excellent.I have installed McAfee Internet Security Suite 2007 on two computers so far. The first one is a Dell laptop. I unistalled the previous 2006 edition and Ad-Aware (since Ad-Aware and the 2007 ed. are incompatible) and the installation was perfect. Not the least problem.I ran into problems though with my desktop. I have tried to remove the 2006 edition and I could not find a remove button in Windows' Add/Remove Progrmas. I poped the 2007 ed. in and it said that it will remove the old products automatically. After the instalation the Firewall did not work. I noticed that somehow the old 2006 ed. was still there. I went to McAfee's web site and I got a removal utility that got rid of all McAfee products on my computer. Another great tool I used off of their web site was ""Virtual Technician"" which told me that the entire installation was messed up. However, after cleaning up with the other utility I did a fresh installation and everything works perfectly.It took me a few hours to get a hold of the problem, yet I love to play with computers.McAfee should not be hold accountable for a product that performs excellent in normal conditions. I continue to trust McAfee's products.I love the cleaning utility. It is very thorough. I plan to use it every day before visiting banking and financial sites. It cleans all of your internet traces.It takes a while until you get used to where all the tools and settings are placed, yet any new complex bundle of software would present you with the same challange.I hope that the 2008 edition will have the anonymizer built in. It would be a great tool.In the end, protection is what it matters, and McAfee Virus Scan and Personal Firewall have done it for me for the last 7 years."

Once Apple announced the new iPods in July, I knew it was time. I thought I should wait for the PC version to ensure a smooth operation between this expensive device and my PC, but I also wanted to be able to use my iPod on a Mac should I buy one in the future.So I finally settled on the new 10gb Mac version of the iPod, and a copy of XPlay. So far it's fantastic. It was easy to setup and the interface is clean and efficient. I had no trouble copy nearly a thousand mp3's to my iPod at a fast pace. I look forward to future updates and the continued dedicated support of the MediaFour developers. Their forums are most helpful to their users. I would recommend this software to anyone with a PC and an iPod.Enjoy!"
67836,2,"I bought this product to help me study for the GMAT. I was particularly interested in the PDA flashcards for the GMAT so I could study on the go. There are two major issues with this product for me:1) They do not explicitly say that the included software is identical to the GMAT 800 software, which I had already bought. Not too big of a deal, since I really just wanted the PDA software, but it would have been nice if this were noted in the product description.2) Many of the PDA flashcards have serious errors on them. On the flashcards, there is a Question tab, and an Answer tab. For some flashcards, the answer on the answer tab wasn't even one of the options. On other flashcards, the description isn't correct, or leaves out special cases (and is thus wrong). They obviously put this product out too early and/or did not subject it to any quality control, and I have not seen any updates on their website. Actually, I haven't seen ANY updates for anything on their site.If I could do it over, I would have just bought the GMAT 800 book/CD combo instead. The flashcards are virtually worthless."

73525,1,"I cannot say enough about this program. You don't even have to try to start learning.Lessons fly by and once I've learned a word, I think about it automatically, instead of trying to make associations with how the word sounds or something. (Example: instead of thinking ""Rice... think of an arrow going into a bowl of rice... oh, yeah, Arroz"" - I just see rice and think arroz. I'm not translating from English to Spanish, I'm thinking in Spanish.When I had to take Spanish classes (required for classroom credit) I found that not only did the little I had done in Rosetta Stone helped me excel, but that my pronunciation was unbeatable because I had been constantly using the Rosetta Stone program.While other students struggled to put together sentences, I said sentences almost as quickly as if I were speaking in English, because this program does that - It Helps You THINK in Spanish! This is not because I am any smarter than anyone else; historically in classes I have been an unremarkable student.I personally didn't use the voice recognition part as much, but it also helped. It wasn't as much that I was exactly copying the voice as it was the fact that I could hear how it was supposed to be pronounced and compare it to my own recording.You can get through each lesson very quickly, so there isn't really much reason to get bored with it. There is also, fortunately, some review, but not so much that it is overkill. Obviously you can spend as much or as little time as you want on each lesson.I've been in languages classes and programs (and hated them) for years, and this is the first effective way I have learned to speak a foreign language. I plan to continue in Spanish, and eventually work my way into other languages using Rosetta Stone."
51715,2,"I am very disappointed with the upgrade from 8 to 9. There is hardly any difference between the two programs, and the interface is still a clumsy, antiquated, early Windows edition that Broderbund hasn't even bothered to upgrade to a more modern Windows interface. Many features are annoying that should have been corrected long ago, that only if you're a savvy Windows user can you work around--maybe. I have used this product for many years and haven't found a better substitute yet, but maybe it's because I haven't looked, and maybe it's about time. The product has hardly changed despite the many hyped ""upgrades."" Broderbund invests more energy, it appears, into the hype surrounding all of its add-ons rather than into more substantial software. The source feature is essential for accurate documentation, but it is clumsy to use and limited, and doesn't even produce the correct printed formats (consult an MLA handbook, Broderbund!!!)."

Schedule K-1 was received at the end of 2006 for this property showing residual action of $36 normal income and a distribution of $186 pertinent to the liquidated property sold in 2005. Turbotax is not clear about handling this type of activity when it is not termed as long term capital gain. The worksheet forms seem to be inadequate for this situation. When an override is done to place the $36 on page 1 of the form 1040 electronic filing is not allowed. I sent an email to Turbotax and received an acknowledgment but no suggestions. I used an override and filed my return by mail. The reason I purchased Turbotax Premier TY2006 was because it was advertised as being able to handle Schedule K-1 information.2. It seems that the explanation of the importance the worksheets and their relationship to the population of the various required forms should be emphasized prior to use of the software.Otherwise, this is a very good and useful product.

39376,1,"WebObjects is a framework for deploying database-driven webpages and services. While it does not have the same exposure as ColdFusion, ASP, PHP, etc etc, it is a very strong competitor. I came to it from a PHP and MySQL background, and while it took a couple of weeks to get to grips with the WebObjects outlook, it is now a total joy to work with.The main thing about WebObjects that seperates it from the rest is the fact that it is an object-oriented system. Once you have the objects set up, you very rarely have to interact with the database at all, as the framework deals with all of the sql calls. Indeed, because of this fact, the database itself is totally removed from the logic, and so a vast range of databases can be used interchangeably: MySQL, OpenBase, Oracle, and any JDBC database. And relational databases are even easier, suprisingly enough, especially when compared to how difficult relationships are to follow with PHP.Everyone working with any high-traffic databse-driven website should at the least check this out. I did, and now I'm a total convert. There is a free 30-day trial available at the apple website."

It involves A LOT of hard puzzles that I couldn't figure out without the walkthrough. There was much that I couldn't do because of how hard it was. I didn't like how every time I turned around I HAD to do something that was hard and frustrating. And I didn't like how they were chanting and how there was a curse on the mansion. People HAVE put curses on things including pc games.But other then that, it was scary and intimidating. That was what I liked. There's lots of running around, getting up in the middle of the night, getting scared and hunting for things and so on. I DID like how you had to do that. But lots and LOTS of VERY hard puzzles and games. I'd rate this game for 12 up."

Also, you do not NEED an ASIO compatible soundcard. I am able to use my motherboard integrated card and still use the playbak feature. I am sure the sound may be better with the proper card though. Also, you will need a newer DVD-ROM. The older DVD-ROMs will not read the DVD's formatting."

63191,1,"I was originally using Rosetta Stone's Chinese program through online subscription. I went several times through the entire program before I decided that monthly subscription was getting expensive and since I enjoyed going over this program very much I finally decided to purchase it.The online version has Chinese only written with pinyin and I was a little bit disappointed that it didn't have Chinese characters anywhere. When I received the package, I was thrilled and delighted to find that it had two books included and the books had all the material written both with Chinese characters and pinyin. This has taken my enjoyment of this program to a new level.I do need to add that I have purchased numerous other books and programs, so this is not the only one I have been using - and the other books and programs have helped me tremendously in using this one.Working with the entire Pimsleur program first has helped me tremendously in working with Rosetta Stone, as did many other books that deal with grammar and writing. Also, among different dictionaries, one of my favorites is Wenlin's electronic dictionary as well as NJStar program. Yes, getting all of these programs can get pricey, but they are all well-worth it, especially if you're learning Chinese on your own. They will serve you for a long time and will make the arduous process of learning Chinese a breeze, allowing you to progress easily and to enjoy the process."

86457,1,"I have been using various photo editors over the years and haven't found one that does it all. I haven't tried Photoshop because of its high price and steep learning curve. What prompted me to get Capture NX was my desire to shoot RAW format in my new Nikon D80.Why shoot RAW? This can be a whole other story, but RAW is the best image you can get from a digital camera. It is compressed, but RAW takes truer colors than JPEG. Plus it has more information about a photo for better editing.All Nikon DSLR's come with Project which is a rudimentary photo manager. All it does well is convert RAW to JPEG. Other photo editors can edit RAW, but their capabilities are usually limited.I first heard about Capture NX from a few web sites and Nikon offers a 30-day trial. Once I started using the trial version I was hooked. It doesn't do everything, but it has some really powerful capabilities. Nikon has a new term for image editing they call D-Lighting. I guess that means Dynamic Lighting. The closest comparison is Auto-Exposure. It sharpens and adjusts lighting on photos. I use this a lot as it does a pretty good job of enhancing a photo. Some of Nikon's new DSLR's like the D80 and D40 now have D-Lighting as part of the camera's built-in editing capabilities.Another ""cool"" feature are the ""Control Points"". These are points that you can be put anywhere on a photo and selectively adjust brightness, contrast and saturation. You can adjust how wide or small of an area it adjusts. This is really good for adjusting a wide area in a photo. Like darkening a background to hide it or enhancing a background to make it pop out. This is much easier than other photo editors where they either adjust the whole photo, or you have to carefully mask an area off. Problem with masking is the adjustments are usually too noticeable. With Capture NX the adjustments with the Control Point are blended pretty well so you can't really see the adjustment. It also has the normal red-eye reduction and other adjustments. It has a lot of sophisticated adjustments for light curves and RGB histograms. I haven't mastered those yet, but they do help. Noise reduction is another plus.What is missing from this program are some basic cloning tools. Many times I like to clone an area on to a similar area to remove hot spots or smooth them up. Capture NX just allows you to tone it down, but not complete cover it up. I also wish it had more basic batch tools like renaming many photos at once. The renaming process is overly complicated.This editor can be used with any JPEG or TIFF photo. You can also compensate for dust on a DSLR CCD sensor by taking a reference dust-off photo and then Capture NX can use that photo to remove dust particles on images.Who should use this software? I would not recommend this to beginners. It is powerful, but many of the tools are not for beginners. If you own a Nikon DSLR then this would be good for editing RAW. I have been taking photos for years and have owned about 5 SLR cameras and this tool is teaching me new things about photos in general. I would also not consider this software a replacement for Photoshop, but it does do a lot for the price."

IF you have enough money, you can buy ANOTHER HORSE! You can have five horses at a time, but each one's price is pretty high.Riding is fun, too. There are tons of fun riding courses--three exercise ones and nine trail rides called ride outs, but you have to finish exercise course # 2 before you can go on any ride outs.There are three different levels for three different places in the ride outs. You can ride in the forest, at the beach, or in the city.They're really fun, but hard, too.Plus, you can up-grade your stable and get a guest house.The five things you should do (called ""Aim of the Game""), are: Have your horse's trust in you go to at least 95%, Breed a Foal, Complete All Three Exercise Courses, Have your Guest House money be high (upgrade the guest house), and Win the Champion Competition. On all of them (I think), you only get the money for them once (if you get another horse, and its trust goes up, but your first horse's trust was at at least 95% first, you won get the money for the trust again).This is a really fun game--I recommend it totally!"

Fireworks is more geared to web work whereas Photoshop's focus has always been print, with web design features added. The learning curve isn't as steep as I thought it would be and Fireworks has some great tutorials to help with your transition. It really has a better work flow than Photoshop and seems to be more intuitive. I'm glad I finally made the switch. I would highly recommend the product to those getting started in web design and those ready to take on the gold standard in web design."

It has addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and also solving problems.Polly probably mixed up the past, but give this to your child. They can fix the problems in a snap. And if you have a boy, it would take the time away from game boy. When they are done with the game (which will take a long time) your child will take over third grade. (It will help prepare)."
8174,1,This is a fabulous way to make geography interesting. As a homeschooling Mom I recommend this as a great family way to learn the world. Forget gluing coffee beans to Brazil's map. (All I remember from my old geography classes.) THIS is the way to get kids to know that Japan is not in China and Sweden and Switzerland aren't even close.

However, I had to take the program off my computer because it slowed everything down. I will reinstall it at a later time when I have time to use it. But to have it sitting on my computer for me to use it a few minutes a day isn't worth the headache of it slowing everything down."

I was actually trying to order the Africana series but my research indicated that the third edition of Africana was located on this platform. Kudos to Microsoft for combining a single source comprehensive management system for historical data. As for the individual who complained that there was far too much African / African American data, perhaps you fail to understand what Microsoft was trying to achieve in its endeavor (and a very successful one I might add) to merge various sources and components of history under one foundation. From my perspective as an historical researcher, there can never be too much data in my quest for information. 5 Stars for this product!"

86810,1,"My son loves this game, and solving the exercises and problems was fun to earn clues to the mystery. It seemed the appropriate level of challenge, as he will be entering 4th grade in the fall, and he needed help with some of the exercises, especially fractions. That was a good opportunity to introduce him to the subject. With the ADAPT feature, if they get stuck, the software keeps the level easy enough so they don't get too frustrated, and hard enough that it is still challenging. I highly recommend this software."
61705,0,Well this game is limited on play & it doesn't take too long to accomplish all the tasks. But on the other side it is a good game for a young child to learn how to use the mouse on.
